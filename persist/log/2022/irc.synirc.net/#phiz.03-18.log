01:13:17 <Melber> Dang mason you look great congrats
01:13:44 <greatest_gamer> lmao thank you that video is fucking me up
01:13:59 <dreddybajs> mason you look fuckin great man
01:14:05 <dreddybajs> hell yes
01:14:06 <greatest_gamer> in my head i should be like three times that size
01:14:35 <dreddybajs> shrimp1989dspinfo and i were talking about it on discord earlier when we saw the flaming moes pic
01:14:44 <dreddybajs> insane journey my man
01:15:46 <Melber> You can be whatever size you want but frankly you sound so happy about yourself and I get real excited every time you're like CHECK ME OUT
01:15:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
01:16:40 <dreddybajs> yea
01:16:44 <dreddybajs> fuckin rocks
01:17:07 <Melber> So many people itc have had good journeys of personal growth, it makes me sometimes very happy (and sometimes makes me feel like I'm falling behind)
01:18:31 <Melber> This is very real of me I guess but in the past few years I've lost a lot of friends to ODs or otherwise unhealthy behavior and the chat has been sort of the opposite of that and it gives me strength 
01:19:50 <ajj> agreed
01:19:52 <scoop_jackson> melber you have the most respectable career (by my estimation) of everyone in this chat so dont sell yourself short
01:19:55 <ajj> inspirational phiz crew ftw
01:21:16 <Melber> scoop_jackson: I mean I appreciate that but I also have a lot of the "I am punching way over my weight class" thing going on with my job
01:22:16 <Melber> I'm only decent in my job because the people above me are good at pointing me in the right direction. 
01:25:40 <greatest_gamer> thank you my friends we are all crushing it
01:26:00 <greatest_gamer> we are high level operators
01:26:39 <scoop_jackson> i meant more in the sense that you have taken a more moral route than me for example. like i know a lot of what you do is rewarding but im sure your worst clients are way more stressful than my worst clients, and you work in an under compensated underserved area.  i think we all feel like we are out of our depth in our careers from time to time. i know mason has talked about that and i've definitely felt that way. 
01:27:44 <Melber> Also I don't wanna break down respectable job too much, I got to choose my career with a lot less pressure than most folks cuz my family got very lucky when I was in high school and I've never had to REALLY worry about material needs
01:27:51 <greatest_gamer> lmao the peter principle wikipedia article should have my pic on it
01:29:18 <Melber> Every time I've gotten promoted someone has quit as a result lol
01:29:42 <Melber> Now in fairness, they were not qualified for the jobs they wanted

02:16:03 <dreddybajs> Nude_Riker: if youre not aware, the context there is that a bunch of gangs were stealing diggers, using them to pull ATMs out of walls, and then stealing the money and dumping the ATMs
02:16:17 <NORG> griggers
02:16:39 <Nude_Riker> fantastic
02:16:43 <dreddybajs> very funnily an extremely well-known GAA athlete was found guilty of planning the thefts

02:17:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> FERT 22
02:17:15 <dreddybajs> The final attempt to steal an ATM was thwarted by gardaí who were watching as the gang drove a digger up beside an ATM in Virginia, Co Cavan in the early hours on August 14, 2019. Gardaí saw a stolen Toyota Landcruiser in convoy with the digger. The Landcruiser was pulling a trailer into which the gang intended to place the ATM before taking it to a premises at Tullypole, Moynalty, Co Meath where the money would be taken 
02:17:15 <dreddybajs> from it. Gardaí would later discover more than €438,000 hidden in various locations and buried in the ground at Tullypole.

14:36:12 <Selfie_Dad> i found it to be a dead end and went to do other shit
14:36:13 <registered_mirc> at the top of caelid on the right side
14:36:15 <Selfie_Dad> ill go look at it now
14:36:37 <registered_mirc> there are little assholes around there that you can sneak up on and back stab for 1k souls each
14:36:43 <registered_mirc> but do not aggro them
14:36:47 <registered_mirc> you will get fucked up
14:36:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh yeah but BE careful because they do insane damage
14:36:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah
14:36:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they cause blood loss
14:37:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they can still 2-3 hit kill me if i'm not careful
14:37:10 <Selfie_Dad> hmm theres a mist by this grace in the castle
14:37:12 <Selfie_Dad> is that godrick

14:39:29 <Selfie_Dad> came in some back way
14:39:53 <registered_mirc> you can run past him and it's almost like a straight shot to the room she's chillin in
14:40:19 <registered_mirc> like that area has a big curve out to where all the guys are
14:40:26 <registered_mirc> its like at the apex of the curve, thereabout

14:42:47 <Selfie_Dad> oh hold on
14:42:50 <Selfie_Dad> i see some stuff down

14:58:29 <Selfie_Dad> the skelton guys were my fault anyway for trying to do my patented "circle strafe and slap w/ whip" manuever on a group of like 6 of them
14:58:34 <Selfie_Dad> w/o knowing what kind of shit they did

14:58:53 <Selfie_Dad> its the only good weapon i have
14:58:59 <Selfie_Dad> besides hook claw i guess
14:59:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i tried a whip for a few min and decided pretty much immediately that it is not for me
14:59:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> go get the uchigatana
14:59:08 <Selfie_Dad> which is ok but i like the range of the whip

15:16:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> someone emailed me asking if i'm in charge of a specific market segment and when i told her i wasn't she asked about mine
15:16:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i've been on edge for like 45 min expecting a big bad email
15:16:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because she didn't respond after i told her
15:16:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and didn't explain why she was asking
15:17:41 <Nude_Riker> O_O'
15:18:23 <Nude_Riker> sammo please get up from the couch you are worrying me!!!
15:18:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what's wrong with him
15:20:23 <Nude_Riker> dunno he's been lying there all day didnt even get up to eat breakfast or yell at me
15:20:32 <Selfie_Dad> .l
15:20:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ): maybe you should take him to the vet
15:21:37 <Nude_Riker> hoping he's just constipated again, after i picked him up and petted and brushed him a bunch he puked up some water and stood in the litterbox for a bit and went back to the couch
15:21:52 <Nude_Riker> so i gave him a dose of the laxative from last time
15:21:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> good luck sammo...
15:22:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you should mix broth in with his dry fod
15:22:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> food*
15:22:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> unsalted broth
15:22:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and water with canned food
15:22:46 <Nude_Riker> he dont eat the dry food
15:22:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> one time claire got really sick because she had a hairball in her colon
15:23:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it gave her an infection that took days to go away
15:23:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> even after she passed it
15:23:21 <Nude_Riker> :(
15:24:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but yeah mix water or unsalted broth with his canned food
15:24:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what brand do you feed them? it's weird he's becoming constipated if he's only eating wet food
15:25:31 <Nude_Riker> i switch it around sometimes but the mostly frisky pate these days
15:25:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> fewffwefwfewffew
15:25:59 <Nude_Riker> this happened a couple years ago and then again last year
15:25:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> fancy feast is supposed to be good for cats who aren't getting enough liquid
15:26:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> maybe try that?
15:26:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i give that to mine
15:26:14 <Nude_Riker> the vet said he needs fiber not more water
15:26:32 <Nude_Riker> which is why he was supposed to be eating the rx fiber dry food but he refused/would end up puking it up
15:27:02 <Nude_Riker> i was mixing canned pumpkin in for a bit but they stopped eating it after a few weeks, might try mixing some psyllium husk in
15:27:16 <Nude_Riker> with some water cause thatll soak up moisture
15:27:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wonder if the constipation is causing him to be picky
15:28:04 <Nude_Riker> he's always hated dry food, idk
15:29:36 <bonegar> can cats eat psyllium husk
15:30:27 <Nude_Riker> i believe so, someone told me they add some to their cat's food
15:30:54 <bonegar> this was my first thought as a not-cat-person
15:31:04 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i've used benefiber for dog before
15:31:12 <Selfie_Dad> mix into water and then mix into food

15:38:39 <registered_mirc> just wait til u get the goonveil
15:38:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ya that's what i'm going for next
15:38:57 <Selfie_Dad> ill get it in approximately *checks watch* 3 years
15:38:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> uchigatana has carried me throughout most of the game so far
15:39:00 <Selfie_Dad> at this rate
15:39:12 <registered_mirc> nothign wrong with that imo
15:39:23 <Selfie_Dad> i still got love for whip
15:39:25 <bonegar> i killed a bunch of bosses and got to a big tree and now the creepy old lady is giving me 3 options and i havent decided so im gonna go around and finish up some stuff 
15:39:34 <Selfie_Dad> whip is a good horse weapon for mobs w/o much range
15:39:44 <bonegar> did you find the sword whip?
15:39:44 <Selfie_Dad> u can just circle strafe em and slap em to death
15:39:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i killed a putrid erdtree or whatever it's claled
15:39:48 <Selfie_Dad> and they cant do much
15:39:49 <Selfie_Dad> no
15:39:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the putrid guy
15:40:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm gonna do the other one now
15:40:03 <registered_mirc> putrid erdtree gives many souls
15:40:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ya
15:40:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> mpg i've gotten so much better at this game since the lsat time you hung out with us in voice
15:40:28 <Selfie_Dad> im level 47, should i be able to kill the tree guy at the beginning
15:40:31 <Selfie_Dad> now
15:40:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm finally comfortable with combat and i can dodge attacks
15:40:38 <registered_mirc> is it more fun now shrimp?
15:40:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i think i was just in a place where like
15:41:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i was overleveled for the entry zones and underleveled for what i needed to do
15:41:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i needed to decide on a clear build
15:41:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so i respecced a bit and i have good talismans 
15:41:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> tree sentinel is scary
15:41:22 <bonegar> lol shrimp we have the same play style
15:41:24 <bonegar> it rules
15:41:28 <registered_mirc> i dont do "builds" but thats cool and as long as its fun thats a win
15:41:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i just mean like
15:41:45 <registered_mirc> tree sentinel is a fun fight imo
15:41:45 <Selfie_Dad> i wish u could break down armor into smithing stones instead of just selling
15:41:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i needed to pick a couple things to focus on instead of everything
15:41:49 <Selfie_Dad> that would be cool
15:41:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah same
15:41:57 <bonegar> everything is cool too tbqh
15:41:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so i'm focusing mainly on str and int
15:42:08 <bonegar> i need all the stats
15:42:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah it just sucks when i feel too weak for what i should be doing
15:42:12 <registered_mirc> thats pretty much what i did
15:42:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wish i had all the stats!!
15:42:16 <registered_mirc> i dont do faith or arcane
15:42:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i started out as a confessor
15:42:37 <Selfie_Dad> i put a little in to those just to be able to use a spell or two
15:42:41 <bonegar> arcane is my dump stat but it seems to scale with some kinda cool rose thorn weirdo set
15:42:41 <Selfie_Dad> but seems like it wasnt worth it
15:42:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i decided glintstone sorcery was probably a better thing to use
15:42:53 <Selfie_Dad> unless going for a magic build
15:43:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and now that i'm like level 80 i can do insane damage with glintstone pebbles while i dump points into mind for more fp
15:43:16 <registered_mirc> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923058051450282086/954404588604248094/20220318104253_1.jpg
15:43:17 <registered_mirc> that's me rn
15:43:42 <bonegar> i can't really just go up and whack a guy or tank them, but i can do a lot of weird utility things and if i stance up right i can gas bosses with my sword of night and flame... but if i get caught up i crumple
15:43:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/mgxc9eNC/image.png
15:43:49 <registered_mirc> probably going to stop pumping int at 50
15:43:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah same bonegar
15:43:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have to be careful
15:44:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i just roll around a lot
15:44:14 <bonegar> i like playing that way, but i'm kinda roleplaying out my character in my mind
15:44:20 <bonegar> not going for best stats to do most damage
15:44:34 <registered_mirc> i only go for high dmg because i dont want to struggle
15:44:45 <registered_mirc> and i want to be relaxed so i can enjoy the atmosphere
15:44:51 <bonegar> all approaches are valid and this is why it's a wonderful game
15:44:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't like greatswords so i won't do big damage
15:45:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm not good enough at fighting for the cooldown
15:45:22 <bonegar> im a big fan of the magic greatsword for mounted combat
15:45:24 <bonegar> feels so bad asse
15:45:46 <registered_mirc> i wanted to do double colossal swords for a while but the requirements are too much
15:45:53 <bonegar> but MIND is such an expensive stat... you gotta pump it to like 20 to get only 100 mp
15:46:06 <bonegar> ending up sucking down potions a lot
15:46:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah it's really annoying
15:51:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> damn this other one is a lot harder than the first one i killed

16:12:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> true
16:12:09 <Nude_Riker> yeah 800 doesnt seem bad at this point
16:12:13 <registered_mirc> 300 over msrp sucks but
16:12:14 <Selfie_Dad> isnt that tech like 5 years old
16:12:17 <registered_mirc> that's the world we live in now
16:12:25 <registered_mirc> 3060 is the current line
16:12:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i got mine for 660 w tax and i was assmad about paying anything over msrp
16:12:40 <registered_mirc> if it was a 2060 that would not be good
16:12:50 <Selfie_Dad> .l
16:12:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's upgrading from a 1260 and plays more current gen games than i do
16:13:18 <Selfie_Dad> i found a gtx8800 in my basement a few weeks ago
16:14:28 <Nude_Riker> yeah i have a 2060 super and theyre still going stupid expensive lol
16:14:49 <Nude_Riker> even mine was like 400 brand new when i built this pc
16:15:36 <Selfie_Dad> it seems there is a chip shortage
16:15:44 <Selfie_Dad> but there certainly isnt a chump shortage
16:20:30 <Selfie_Dad> d
16:24:07 <dreddybajs> Selfie_Dad: you probably found it by now but at lake facing cliffs just go down past the church and keep left of the graveyard, there's a path that leads downhill into the lake, through a guard camp
16:24:17 <dreddybajs> you don't need to make any big jumps or anything
16:24:26 <dreddybajs> i thought the same thing that it was a dead end at first
16:24:37 <Selfie_Dad> get i got down it
16:24:42 <Selfie_Dad> doing the jumps
16:24:50 <Selfie_Dad> i have progressed
16:25:35 <Selfie_Dad> pissed that i could have done that the whole time w/o fucking w/ margit lol
16:26:06 <bonegar> i did the entire academy before i went back and fought marg
16:27:32 <Selfie_Dad> well i was led to believe beating margit was a prerequisite for progressing beyond that are
16:27:33 <Selfie_Dad> a

16:31:51 <registered_mirc> i think a lot of people thought that until they learned the game
16:32:51 <dreddybajs> yeah i definitely got to lake facing cliffs, missed the path, and went "huh this is it i guess"

16:35:05 <registered_mirc> my whole overworld map is complete.
16:36:59 <bonegar> there's stuff i still havent found like various islands, the chunk behind the atlas plateau, underground stuff
16:37:58 <Selfie_Dad> while you were out there exploring, i was, uh, doing other stuff not playing video game
16:38:16 <registered_mirc> we should continue to compare stuff

18:05:19 <wild_ape-style_creature> owned

18:06:27 <wild_ape-style_creature> very direct which was nice
18:06:30 <wild_ape-style_creature> at least she wasn't paggro about it
18:07:21 <Selfie_Dad> was the scolding from ur boss
18:07:24 <wild_ape-style_creature> no

18:08:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> she was one of the few who was supposed to receive it apparently
18:08:32 <dreddybajs> lol
18:08:43 <wild_ape-style_creature> there aren't clear guidelines on who should and should not receive these emails
18:08:48 <wild_ape-style_creature> so i just followed what someone else did this year
18:08:57 <wild_ape-style_creature> maybe she was also privately scolded
18:09:12 <Selfie_Dad> scoldings all the way down
18:09:34 <eric> at my last job someone accidentally sent an email to all 4000 employees 
18:09:43 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm going to do that
18:09:48 <Selfie_Dad> someone did that at my work just a few weeks ago
18:09:55 <eric> and the entire network crashed because people kept replying all asking to be removed from the thread
18:10:00 <wild_ape-style_creature> lmfao
18:10:03 <Selfie_Dad> theyve actually locked down the ability to send to @whole hospital
18:10:12 <Selfie_Dad> so only certain people who need to do it can do it
18:10:21 <eric> yeah they fixed it after that 
18:10:35 <Selfie_Dad> and this is a new person who needs to do it.... confirming to the security team that they can do it, and putting the whole hospital in the cc field

18:59:15 <wild_ape-style_creature> i watched that
18:59:26 <bonegar> it doesn't surprise me at all
18:59:30 <wild_ape-style_creature> aqua teal is ocol because he just has funny clips instead of psycho edits that are like 3 hours long

19:01:05 <wild_ape-style_creature> i don't know
19:01:12 <wild_ape-style_creature> people said it wa sweird he was saying that
19:01:16 <antiracist_baby> lmfao
19:01:24 <antiracist_baby> youre not a man just because you can grow a beard. you can still be a moron.
19:01:29 <bonegar> it's absolutely a weird word to throw around imo
19:01:43 <antiracist_baby> it is very weird
19:01:50 <antiracist_baby> "think youre a big boy cause you got a beard" - dsp

19:02:32 <bonegar> that's how people talk
19:02:33 <bonegar> not my problem
19:02:39 <wild_ape-style_creature> he should have paid more attention to her
19:02:42 <wild_ape-style_creature> she's really normal now
19:02:45 <wild_ape-style_creature> i follow her on insty
19:02:51 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm glad she's thriving
19:02:56 <wild_ape-style_creature> she has a rabbit
19:03:08 <bonegar> it's just very funny when people slip into that langauge they've probably never bothered to analyze and then you realize lots of guys just love talking about butt rape
19:03:15 <antiracist_baby> its really funny how much he ignores her in their videos together
19:03:28 <bonegar> he's right to
19:03:30 <bonegar> daddy's working
19:03:32 <antiracist_baby> whenever she is in a dsp tries it he ignores or belittles everything she says

19:05:05 <Nude_Riker> in 2016
19:05:10 <Nude_Riker> instead of a phone
19:05:13 <bonegar> maybe as common as feet or hands
19:05:26 <Nude_Riker> vlogging with my sony handycam
19:05:36 <wild_ape-style_creature> this fridge thing seems like a gag
19:05:39 <wild_ape-style_creature> but it's phil so it's real
19:05:43 <antiracist_baby> 2016 was still his baller era right
19:05:47 <antiracist_baby> he shouldve had a sick phone
19:05:51 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah
19:06:04 <antiracist_baby> he probably did and then also had a camcorder though
19:06:06 <wild_ape-style_creature> i mean he's still making like 120-140k/yeah

19:33:03 <dreddybajs> :|
19:34:07 <greatest_gamer> by the time i get it i can follow a plat trophy walkthrough and siphon all the joy from it like shang tsung
19:34:27 <puttz_dudemane> the chocobo dubstep is kinda terrible but since it's barely chocobo and hardly dubstep, it sorta works, it's almost some gabor lazar shit really if you think on it
19:34:44 <greatest_gamer> warrkstep
19:34:50 <greatest_gamer> it works with everything!
19:35:52 <dreddybajs> tfw not enough stonesword key

19:38:05 <registered_mirc> just because you're you

19:38:49 <greatest_gamer> https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/register-to-buy/
19:38:54 <registered_mirc> i just want to play new demon's souls god damn it
19:39:01 <registered_mirc> yeah i'm on that list i think
19:39:17 <greatest_gamer> o ok ya i would just wait but also make sure you have all the sony emails enabled
19:39:26 <greatest_gamer> if you have it set to not receive promo shit you won’t see it

19:39:32 <registered_mirc> fuck

19:39:47 <greatest_gamer> lol always a string
19:39:52 <bonegar> https://twitter.com/appleIIcracks/status/1504902974392336386
19:40:00 <greatest_gamer> i got mine thru walmart but i had to pay for walmart+
19:40:08 <greatest_gamer> i will get use out of this being in a rural area but
19:40:11 <greatest_gamer> idk for anyone else
19:40:26 <registered_mirc> yeah walmart is not really useful for me unforch
19:40:36 <greatest_gamer> ya and u can’t cheese it with a trial
19:40:40 <greatest_gamer> paid membership only
19:40:41 <registered_mirc> theres like 1 in the city here
19:40:47 <greatest_gamer> if they do another one soon i can get u one tho
19:40:52 <greatest_gamer> i’m keeping the walmart+
19:41:01 <registered_mirc> if that happens i will def hook you up for hookin me up
19:41:16 <greatest_gamer> ya i got u lord knows i suffered enough for the two of us
19:41:27 <greatest_gamer> i have so much egg on my face i could open a denny’s
19:41:48 <registered_mirc> lol
19:41:52 <bonegar> walmart is tough cuz you cant buy nothin good inside of there it all just breaks immediately
19:41:57 <registered_mirc> how much dmg is all that egg tho
19:42:15 <greatest_gamer> i get cheaper gas and it’s the closest store to my house once i’m off the mountain
19:42:20 <greatest_gamer> and i can do scan n go
19:42:22 <greatest_gamer> no lines
19:42:28 <bonegar> bought a bike pump once and it broke in 1 use and i had to return it, bought a fishing pole there once nad it didn't work and had to return it, bought a hat there once and it fell apart in 2 days...i guess they might be cool to steal from tho
19:42:35 <registered_mirc> no lines is cool
19:43:08 <bonegar> stealing from walmart is like stealing from a dump... not a crime
19:43:25 <greatest_gamer> ya bonegar i consider anything from walmart to be temporary or placeholder and if it happens to last or actually be good it’s a happy accident
19:43:48 <greatest_gamer> it’s really easy to steal from every store rn actually
19:44:01 <bonegar> i felt very stupid buying the bike pump and thinking 'oh this will work'
19:44:08 <bonegar> then it fell apart immediately lmao
19:44:09 <puttz_dudemane> yesterday i decided i should keep the ps5 cause surely gran turismo is going to be better so maybe i should tell the craigslist drifter anime boob stickers guy that i want it back. Welllllll https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/gran-turismo-7
19:44:34 <greatest_gamer> usually michelle will see a lil decor thing and be like ehh it’s too much for what it is and then i’ll just pocket it
19:45:06 <bonegar> stealing decor feels like bad feng sui to me
19:45:28 <greatest_gamer> i stole a stuffed black cat i feel like that’s some kind of incredibly bad luck
19:45:30 <bonegar> but sometimes you need a thing
19:45:31 <greatest_gamer> hasn’t kicked in yet
19:45:55 <bonegar> probably a net positive to steal from them in general so maybe it's protecting you
19:45:55 <greatest_gamer> if it does tho i know which totem i have to destroy so
19:46:01 <greatest_gamer> it’ll be a quick trip
19:46:32 <greatest_gamer> i mostly steal from target because the staff is all teens flirting with each other
19:47:04 <registered_mirc> puttz_dudemane: u should play demon's souls
19:47:09 <greatest_gamer> walmart is more like overworked people on their second/third job of the day and exploiting their indifference seems somehow immoral
19:47:19 <greatest_gamer> so target it is
19:47:23 <puttz_dudemane> i only started getting caught at target, their shit was on point, nothing like walmart. we would just walk out with bags of shit at walmart
19:47:29 <greatest_gamer> loooooool
19:47:38 <registered_mirc> lol
19:47:46 <bonegar> target is insane
19:47:48 <greatest_gamer> i used to case swap xboxes at target
19:47:57 <greatest_gamer> i did it probably 15 times
19:47:59 <bonegar> people are alwys trying to steal from the target and they have weird guys walking around
19:48:04 <registered_mirc> i did that at best buy
19:48:08 <registered_mirc> swapping hard drives, or ram
19:48:09 <bonegar> last 2 times i've been to a target someone was getting arrested at the door lol
19:48:11 <registered_mirc> old for new
19:48:17 <registered_mirc> they started checking boxes tho
19:48:17 <bonegar> woman screaming type stuff
19:48:24 <registered_mirc> lol bonegar
19:48:26 <greatest_gamer> they got greedy
19:48:33 <registered_mirc> poppin off
19:48:39 <puttz_dudemane> i remember standing at target with the gang related soundtrack under my shirt, and these target employees trying to fuck with me like "hey, so have you heard of this new game called... thief" fuck they're on to me
19:48:39 <greatest_gamer> they tried to get a couple extra hits and YOU DIED
19:48:39 <greatest_gamer> meanwhile i’m racking up souls
19:49:00 <greatest_gamer> lmfao andrey
19:49:28 <puttz_dudemane> sick ass soundtrack though, took 2 tries
19:49:36 <bonegar> target is cool when you're a small child and you can go play the n64 display while your mom shops
19:49:38 <greatest_gamer> reloaded the save for that one
19:49:48 <bonegar> but as an adult it's where white women meet their demise
19:50:02 <greatest_gamer> my mom never let me away from her side in a store because i would wander around and be really hard to find
19:56:37 <Nude_Riker> i remember playing the demo games at walmart
19:56:40 <Nude_Riker> we didnt have target
19:57:12 <bonegar> gonna be the only one in the theater for batman if i book this
19:57:18 <Nude_Riker> .l
19:57:57 <puttz_dudemane> walk down to funcoland, play road rash and that weird driving game on the 3DO, cross street to mcdonalds for the free "kids cone" and wait for new shift to get another one cause they limited it to once a day
19:58:51 <registered_mirc> that sounds fun
19:58:55 <registered_mirc> i can relate
20:02:11 <registered_mirc> elden ring back seating is out of control online lol
20:02:30 <registered_mirc> can't wait for like a year from now when everyone moves on
20:02:40 <bonegar> i simply ignore the normies

20:14:01 <registered_mirc> well i was with my friend but we were the only ones there
20:14:07 <registered_mirc> it was Doom (2005)
20:14:35 <bonegar> no point in going to a movie with someone bcecause 1.) you can't talk to them during the movie. 2.) you can't talk about what you saw after
20:14:37 <bonegar> no point
20:15:01 <eric> q: do you want to talk about the movie a: did you misunderstand something ?
20:15:09 <bonegar> lmao
20:15:41 <bonegar> *long, awkward silence* ".... sooo, what'd ya think about the movie?" *ready to agree with any statement to avoid conflict* 'yea totally.'
20:16:23 <ajj> lol
20:16:43 <registered_mirc> i will simply take the opposite stance to create a sense of opposition
20:16:59 <ajj> i like going to the movies alone at like a wednesday afternoon and im the only person in the theater and its like i have my own personal movie theater
20:16:59 <bonegar> 'oh yea that's cool. i can totally see that.'

21:39:43 <greatest_gamer> it’s no mug tour
21:45:25 <eric> I have no doubt in my mind if Phil tried to do a mug review it would be much funnier than mine

22:18:55 <registered_mirc> yeah
22:18:59 <dreddybajs> i bet most people wouldnt have even noticed if they hadnt released the detailed patch notes lol
22:19:30 <registered_mirc> it made it pretty obvious for speedrun but for casual frost stomp still works pretty well
22:19:33 <dreddybajs> it happens in fighting games too, ppls chars get minor nerfs and theyre like "welp time to find a new character, never lucky, fuck you capcom"
22:19:38 <dreddybajs> yea
22:20:06 <registered_mirc> dist has been testing rivers of blood for all rememberances today and its pretty sweet

22:22:48 <dreddybajs> also registered_mirc i just found out that duplicating remembrance with the mausoleum is free, so if youre gonna eat a boss soul, you may as well do that to get 2x the souls lol
22:22:55 <dreddybajs> i figured it cost the amount of souls youd get, but it doesnt
22:23:04 <registered_mirc> cool
22:32:18 <registered_mirc> i wish this wombat was my friend https://i.imgur.com/VK2jr23.jpg

22:46:57 <registered_mirc> so it's final fantasy 1
22:49:02 <mikev> yeah, isn't that the conceit of the game
22:49:05 <mikev> related to ff1
22:50:28 <registered_mirc> what are these words you are using lol
22:51:12 <registered_mirc> the light warriors with 4 crystals fighting against chaost is the plot for ff1
22:52:33 <mikev> conceit is like the concept behind the game
22:52:34 <mikev> Rather than a remake of the first Final Fantasy, Stranger of Paradise was a new storyline using the original as inspiration, focusing on the themes of examining the role and goals of Warriors of Light. 
22:53:12 <registered_mirc> ah
22:53:37 <bonegar> what if we retold the story of ff1 but with beefy himbos
22:53:44 <mikev> that's a million dollar idea imo
22:54:20 <registered_mirc> .gis himbo
22:54:31 <registered_mirc> i think they are already himbos
22:55:07 <mikev> https://twitter.com/BayouBeeUN/status/1494438940102873091
22:55:54 <registered_mirc> from being a cop to owning cows
22:58:02 <registered_mirc> i wonder what depth theyre going to try to add to ff1
22:58:07 <registered_mirc> hopefully it's not too intrusive
22:59:23 <registered_mirc> one of the characters is literally named after one of the names they used in the final fantasy strategy guide
23:00:24 <eric> im jealous of rick ross
23:01:12 <wild_ape-style_creature> me too
23:01:50 <eric> i like that he tells the horses to mind their own business
23:01:59 <eric> frankly horses should be told that morte often
23:02:10 <scoop_jackson> Here’s one for you mikev https://youtu.be/mAinpO5pL-g
23:02:25 <wild_ape-style_creature> agree
23:02:36 <wild_ape-style_creature> horses are nosy
23:02:45 <mikev> ty nic
23:09:45 <HellaBrad> That looks like such a premium cow to own, rick ross knows how to pick em
23:10:22 <HellaBrad> Has a powerful attitude in its stance
23:14:16 <bonegar> nice cow
23:26:54 <Selfie_Dad> .y premium i'd say creamulum
23:27:25 <mikev> ^
23:29:25 <wild_ape-style_creature> i just realized people use the word horse for whores in elden ring messages
23:29:45 <wild_ape-style_creature> i saw an npc woman sitting somewhere and a message near her that said "use horse"
23:30:01 <wild_ape-style_creature> and i've been thinking about it  and it just clicked
23:30:16 <Selfie_Dad> be wary of horse
23:30:18 <eric> rude

23:41:36 <dreddybajs> and it says
23:41:39 <dreddybajs> if only i had a lover....
23:41:57 <wild_ape-style_creature> it's too real right now so i hate htem
