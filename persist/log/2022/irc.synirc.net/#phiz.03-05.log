00:14:26 <dreddybajs> in fact all ive said is, its very hard
00:14:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wanna hop on voice?
00:14:33 <this_fellow_kermit> 11:02 PM <dreddybajs> u completely misunderstand my gamer mentality
00:14:33 <this_fellow_kermit> 11:03 PM <dreddybajs> i like challenges

00:14:53 <dreddybajs> i like to take breaks 
00:15:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i got to a boss in elden ting and i'm not gonna do it
00:15:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's a fat drago
00:15:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> dragon
00:15:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> doesnt sound like you like to take breaks if ur at the end of an 80 hr game
00:15:51 <this_fellow_kermit> dreddy is a coward
00:16:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> agreed
00:16:10 <dreddybajs> im exploring other stuff in the game
00:16:10 <bonegar> my boss order so far has been... that red dog guy, marg, then the guy i wanna call goldrack, then any other boss i beat wasn't worth remembering
00:16:25 <dreddybajs> i find for hard bosses i do better if i take break and do something else when i get frustrated 
00:16:26 <mpg> did the ancestor spirit
00:16:31 <dreddybajs> nice mpg
00:16:33 <dreddybajs> cool boss

00:18:33 <bonegar> heresy
00:19:12 <dreddybajs> health is the big one imo shrimp1989dspinfo for learning bosses
00:19:20 <dreddybajs> gives u more time alive to learn their patterns and how to roll through them
00:19:23 <dreddybajs> whats your vigor at?

00:28:04 <eric> there were no cats shrimp but we went to the beach and saw rabbit https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/BdOfhzKl/image.png
00:28:13 <eric> the little freaks love it down there
00:28:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> omg
00:28:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's huge
00:28:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there's like 3 of them
00:28:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> are they friendly???
00:28:39 <eric> they are unafraid
00:28:49 <eric> you can just sit there and theyll hang out
00:28:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i love rabbit...
00:28:56 <eric> there probably hundreds that live down there
00:29:42 <Nude_Riker> nice eric
00:29:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's so cool...
00:30:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm jealous
00:30:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wanna hang out with rabbits
00:30:30 <eric> just buy a bunch and set them free somewhere
00:31:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> pu
00:31:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i could keep them in my house
00:31:24 <eric> set them free in your house
00:31:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think claire and maris would extremely murder them
00:31:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> peter wouldn't care
00:32:06 <eric> my friend has a rabbit and then they got a kitten
00:32:21 <eric> apparently the rabbit is constantly owning the little cat
00:32:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yaaaa i love when a rabbit and a cat are friends
00:32:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> mine are older so idk if that would work
00:33:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> peter is 12 and maris and claire are 8
00:33:07 <eric> i think it would be tough for all involved
00:34:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> one of hte insty accounts i follow wa slike 4 cats and a rabbit
00:34:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and the rabbit just passed
00:34:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he was friends wit hall the cats
00:34:35 <eric> thats sad
00:34:50 <eric> rabbits dont live that long i dont think
00:34:53 <eric> well idk
00:34:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> bunzou wa s8
00:35:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> which seems like a long time for a rabbit but idk
00:35:35 <eric> probably much longer than in the wild
00:35:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> i like my new bed
00:35:46 <eric> i reckon the replacement rate of the beach rabbits is probably rather high
00:35:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> animals should live forever
00:36:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't like that peter is 12 and i get really upset about it
00:36:31 <eric> death is a crazy thing
00:36:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but he's youthful for his age so i think he'll be around for a long time still
00:36:41 <eric> yeah 
00:36:46 <eric> cats can live a long ass time
00:36:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> another cat i follow just passed a couple days ago
00:37:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> tama was 17
00:37:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i cry every time i see one of those posts 
00:37:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i can't deal with it! i hate it
00:38:43 <the_tasteful_nerd> rip to all the cats
00:38:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://www.instagram.com/tamapupu/
00:39:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> kirara had her kidneys fail a few months ago and somehow pulled through
00:40:52 <eric> strong kitty
00:41:34 <eric> i dont follow too many cats 
00:41:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i mostly follow jp cat accounts
00:41:57 <eric> i think about maru though and how that will be very sad when he passes
00:42:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i hate that
00:42:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's like 16 right?
00:42:14 <eric> yeah getting up there
00:42:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah maru willbe sad
00:43:22 <eric> grumpy cat and lil bub are the only american cats i know and i really disliked all the stuff going on around those
00:43:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah the owners were weird freaks about them
00:43:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you shouldn't force your cats to spend time with hundreds of people in public
00:44:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the jp cat owners are cool because they just submit photos of their cats to art galleries and then they all meet up and look at each other's cat photos 
00:44:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i follow a few accounts who take their cats on walks but they don't take them to public meet & greets
00:45:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and one account i follow that's an owl and a cat
00:45:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they take the owl to hang out with other owls
00:45:13 <eric> cool
00:45:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmao https://twitter.com/autogynefiles/status/1499903941932249089?s=21

00:46:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://www.instagram.com/cr8673.hiro/
00:46:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there's the owl and cat
00:47:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> puku and muu
00:47:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> puku is a girl and muu is a boy
00:47:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's funny because they thought puku was a boy this entire time but finally had her sexed a few months ago
00:47:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and when they revealed she's a girl they put her in a bra and wih
00:47:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> sexed in
00:47:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wig

00:50:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's easy to tell with cats
00:50:37 <eric> not for my parents i guess lol

12:23:18 <the_tasteful_nerd> andrey's commitment to coming in here at like 430am and talking to absolutely nobody about extremely andrey shit
12:23:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> is inspiring
12:24:28 <bonegar> best time to be awake really
12:24:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> well i guess for him its more like 1230
12:28:39 <bonegar> .gis snack
12:33:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> lookin like a snack
12:41:37 <bonegar> .gis huge snack
12:44:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> huge snack
12:45:21 <bonegar> im at the witch shrimp
12:45:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't think i've met her yet
12:45:48 <bonegar> ooh nm then i thought you were much further than me for some reason
12:45:52 <bonegar> farther? further? i dunno
12:45:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no we just beat godrick last night
12:46:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've spent most of my time wandering around and leveling up
12:46:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh oh we beat the tree sentinel as well
12:46:30 <bonegar> oh yea i havent beat him yet
12:46:32 <bonegar> i should do that
12:46:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> pee sentinel
12:46:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and soemone invaded my world while we were doing it
12:46:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and we killed him too
12:46:43 <the_tasteful_nerd> how hard are the minor erd tree
12:46:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> just totally by mistake
12:46:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ez if you have flame spells

12:46:52 <the_tasteful_nerd> I dont.
12:46:55 <bonegar> havent tried yet
12:46:58 <the_tasteful_nerd> im not a spell guy.
12:47:03 <bonegar> going in on da witch tho
12:47:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> okay well you should ride torrent in a circle around him to get an idea of his moveset
12:47:24 <bonegar> wish this had japanese voice acting, the english voice acting kinda sucks in this
12:47:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's pretty slow so you can get a few attacks in between swings
12:47:36 <bonegar> my only complaint
12:47:53 -!- bonegar [ghost@skeleton.zone] has joined #phiz
12:48:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he has two big axe swings and a magic bullet attack
12:49:30 <bonegar> no idea whats going on in this fight
12:49:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> my boss strat has mostly been doing summons to disract and then whapping boss w/ whip a few times and repeat
12:49:36 <bonegar> seems to have some kinda gimmick
12:49:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah do that with the little erdtree avatar guys
12:49:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> maybe ill try to beat margit again
12:50:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i used the wolves
12:50:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm still hunting for smithing stone [1]
12:50:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have chores to do before i can game but i'm gonna try and tackle them all this morning
12:51:38 <bonegar> yea the smithing system kinda .. idk, i hate how many tiers of stone there are
12:51:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> are the stones finite
12:52:01 <bonegar> i'd guess a vendor sells them eventually
12:52:02 <the_tasteful_nerd> like theres only so many in the world and thats it
12:52:03 <bonegar> so no
12:52:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah i havent seen any for sale but that makes sense
12:52:17 <bonegar> but there's probably only so many you can get before you unlock the vendor
12:52:23 <bonegar> that's how the souls games are
12:52:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Smithing Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (1)
12:52:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Unlocks: Smithing Stone (1), Smithing Stone (2), Glintstone Scrap
12:52:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Location: Crystalian boss in Raya Lucaria Crystal Tunnel, Liurnia of the Lakes.
12:53:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there are three bell bearings related to smithing stones
12:54:47 <bonegar> ooh
12:54:53 <bonegar> you have to give the bell to the weird thing in the place 
12:55:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah the twin maiden husks
12:55:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> While you can get them all over, the best early game location is the Limgrave Tunnels dungeon in West Limgrave, since the miner enemies in there drop them. They are quite tanky, though.
12:55:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> guess i'm going here when my chores are done
12:58:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah ive only upgraded my whip w/ smith stones
12:58:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> because i feel like all the other weapons are too dogshit to bother upgrading
12:58:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i spent some on my starting sword
12:58:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and then the flail which i ended up not liking
12:58:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and now the uchigatana
12:58:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm stickign with this
12:58:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i did find a crystal sword that looks cool
12:59:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/6ddvvHzM/eldenring_ZUslf8ROA7.png
13:00:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> thats cool lookin
13:00:23 <bonegar> got the tree sentinel
13:00:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hell yeah
13:00:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> i found some new weapon yesterday i havent checked it out yet
13:04:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like the ones that are small and fast because i'm not good at timing my attacks
13:04:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so  the massive axe  i got from godrick or the tree sentinel's halberd are out of the question for me
13:04:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hm maybe i'll game for like an hour before i start doign my chores...
13:09:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> epic gamer time

14:56:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> i'd rather it just be like 58 every day instead of warm and then cold over and over again
14:58:07 <Nude_Riker> found a funny letterboxd guy who somehow found and liked my old review of end of evangelion that must have been 20 pages deep at least
14:58:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
14:58:25 <Nude_Riker> his review of the new batman claims the title card was "a jpeg"
14:58:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> does he have epic reviews
14:58:36 <Nude_Riker> and details "plot holes"
14:58:42 <the_tasteful_nerd> it was probably a png at least. come on dude

15:26:00 <NORG> this ozu is cool
15:26:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> whiych one
15:26:10 <NORG> instead of all the establishing shots being of piers, alleyways, etc
15:26:15 <NORG> its neon buildings & alleyways
15:26:19 <NORG> "the end of summer"
15:26:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> ozu ftw
15:27:01 <bonegar> ozu good
15:27:13 <bonegar> the kurosawa of movies
15:28:26 <NORG> ive seen 10 ozus but not tokyo story yet that's just the kind of zany shit i get up to
15:28:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah my ankles are just bruised
15:28:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> idk why, i haven't done this in a while
15:32:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> ozu owns
15:32:11 <the_tasteful_nerd> tokyo story owns
15:32:32 <the_tasteful_nerd> i keep wanting to watch his late color films and then feeling like i should see more of the early ones first
15:32:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> when the real answer is, when you got films like ozu in them, you cant go wrong
15:33:41 <bonegar> yea 
15:33:44 <bonegar> you can just do whatever really
15:33:52 <bonegar> it's always gonna look good
15:35:26 <NORG> ya i have watched them all in no order
15:35:37 <NORG> he only did 3 color films neways
15:39:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> .gis it's the ultimate penis
15:39:58 <bonegar> lol
15:43:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> vroom
15:44:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't want to do my chores anymore
15:44:12 <the_tasteful_nerd> im tired of laundry
15:44:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> im about to just stop doing everyones laundry
15:44:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> including my own
15:44:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> and just live in filth
15:44:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have been doing that for the last few months and it is time to stop
15:44:50 <bonegar> thought about this and i think that might not be a good idea
15:44:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> which is why i'm doing chores
15:45:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this is the messiest my room has been since i was like 14
15:45:16 <mikev> blues/isles with an early game today
15:45:20 <mikev> dont like that..
15:45:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> avs play at 10pm which i also don't like
15:47:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> my house is a disaster all the time 
15:47:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> and only the kitchen is my fault
15:47:46 <bonegar> that's the problem with people
15:50:11 <the_tasteful_nerd> d
15:53:34 <NORG> my room is hella messy im a slob
15:54:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm usually very clean but my circumstances
15:54:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think once i do this i'll probably maintain my normal level of cleanliness
15:54:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because i'm also gonna start lifting again
15:55:08 <the_tasteful_nerd> ftw
15:55:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> speaking of which
15:55:19 <the_tasteful_nerd> its time to Lift
15:55:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hell yeah
15:55:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i gotta prepare for bike season
15:55:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i am going to do 30 miles this summer
15:56:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> last summer i thought i wouldn't hit 20+ til september but i got it in july so here's hoping i can do 30 that quickly too
15:56:57 <NORG> i wanna get a stationary bike to put in my room (clean) and pedal while i watch stupid crap
15:56:58 <the_tasteful_nerd> my best advice for that is to kinda undulate how much you're doing in a week
15:57:02 <NORG> instead of sit in chair getting fatter while watching stupid crap
15:57:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i went all out last summer and messed up my leg
15:57:30 <the_tasteful_nerd> do a couple shorter rides for speed and then like one longer one a week
15:57:37 <Nude_Riker> my home is pretty messy rn
15:57:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i ride 3-4x/week
15:57:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> and gradually extend how long the long one is
15:57:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i won't do consecutive days
15:57:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> but only test your longest like once a month maybe
15:58:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the last time i did i had to rest for like a week
15:58:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> the long one shouldnt feel liek you put your all into it
15:58:11 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah
15:58:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i did like 60 miles in 4 days or something
15:58:18 <the_tasteful_nerd> overextending urself is a bitch
15:58:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but biking makes my brain feel good and it makes my legs massive which is cool
15:58:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> recovery is the most important thing and the hardest thing to internalize
15:58:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so i just ignore my body telling me to chill
15:59:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> which i should NOT do because i made my leg explode
15:59:14 <mpg> it's gamer time
15:59:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> you can do consecutive days probably but you gotta really manage your exertion properly
15:59:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> like if you do a harder ride one day you can ride again the next but it should probably be pretty leisurely and relatively short
16:00:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> that could end up being better for recovery than not doing anything but its tough to fight the urge to go harder
16:00:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah on days i don't ride i just go for easy hikes
16:00:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> sometimes i don't do anytihng
16:00:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah thats another good way to do it
16:00:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> just get the blood flowing
16:01:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i try to at least walk around so my muscles don't tighten up too much
16:01:06 <mikev> today is psycho mode day at the gym
16:01:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> eventually want to do this rt https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/uqFXefT8/image.png
16:01:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> on my non training days i just walk some more
16:01:14 <the_tasteful_nerd> do incline treadmill 
16:01:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so ~42 miles
16:01:28 <the_tasteful_nerd> how long u gonna do that silly programming mike
16:01:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> probably closer to 44 because i'd cross the bridge
16:02:06 <mikev> until may
16:02:09 <mikev> i adjusted it
16:02:17 <mikev> rather than 5x10 i'm doing 4x4
16:02:29 <mikev> of even heavier stuff than the two other days earlier in the week
16:02:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> oh that doesnt make a lot of sense to me either
16:02:53 <mikev> first too much volume and then too little
16:02:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> the only way the 5x10 makes any sense is if its intended to be like a technique day where you're doing 50-60% 1RM
16:02:56 <mikev> make up your mind
16:03:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> well its too much volume and intensity otherwise
16:03:10 <mpg> tiiiime for game, and red bull
16:03:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> u goin in the other direction
16:03:16 <mikev> 4x4 is too much?
16:03:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> in the afternoons in the spring or in the mornings before work in the summer i do 14-16 mile rides and i save my longer rides for the weekends
16:03:28 <mikev> thats what i was doing for months
16:03:28 <mpg> hefty peepis
16:03:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> no i dont think its too much but i do think its too much if you're doing all the compound lifts on a single day
16:03:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
16:04:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> squat and bench sure but squat DL and bench spreads it a bit thin imo
16:04:28 <the_tasteful_nerd> esp if ur intensity is high and ur working in 80%+ 1RM
16:04:28 <mikev> i've been able to handle it so far, we'll see if i reach a point where it's too much
16:04:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> you got like 2 rest days between ur next gym though right
16:04:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> so it might be aight
16:04:57 <mikev> tomorrow is random accessories then day off
16:05:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> horgmo
16:05:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> i just think that incurs a hefty recovery cost once u start ramping p the weights
16:05:15 <mpg> random accessories memories
16:05:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> shrimp1989dspinfo: my friends said they would go to the regis/ron morelli thing
16:05:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh hell yeah
16:05:26 <mikev> regis ftw
16:05:28 <mpg> oh it's regis too??
16:05:31 <mpg> what the hell lol
16:05:35 <mpg> regis > ron morelli
16:05:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> so i'd be conservative w/ increasing the weight on that day at least
16:05:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> i like both of them
16:05:47 <mpg> always go see regis.
16:05:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> like if ur doing 4x4 of all they should be in ~RPE7 zone on the last set
16:05:54 <the_tasteful_nerd> at most
16:06:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> do you mind if i rest on your couch after
16:06:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> we'll probably still go to the drug church show that night and then go to the thing later 
16:06:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> since it goes til 6 am
16:06:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh yeah for sure
16:06:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ty
16:06:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> maybe you will get to see mango
16:06:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if i don't i'm going to scream
16:06:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> dont scream youll scare mango
16:06:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> sorry mango ):
16:06:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> he takes a long time to be confident in being in a room with a stranger but if youre there for enough hours you might at least get a sighting
16:07:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm extremely good at befriending cats
16:07:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> mason can attest to this
16:07:17 <bonegar> one shotted the mourne boss
16:07:29 <the_tasteful_nerd> woa
16:07:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> our friend who stayed here for a couple days got to pet him 
16:07:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> i havent bothered w/ him yet
16:07:39 <mpg> sick bonegar
16:07:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> steve's cat rivka immediately loved me and she's afraid of everyone else
16:07:42 <dreddybajs> nice bonegar the leonine? that took me a while

16:08:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> dreddybajs i found the one smithing stone i needed and leveled katana from +2 to +8
16:08:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> wasnt a big deal for me 
16:09:24 <bonegar> i guess i should build into vigor
16:09:41 <bonegar> dont really want to but i should
16:09:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> a funny thing in that ron morelli/mumdance rinse set was the presenter (couldnt tell who it was, maybe logan) apologizing like 8 times for the track that had a sample that said FUCKING SHIT 
16:11:03 <dreddybajs> oh hell yeah shrimp1989dspinfo 
16:11:05 <dreddybajs> you doin damage now
16:11:30 <dreddybajs> dont talk about logan in here tom
16:11:32 <dreddybajs> hes my nemesis

16:12:23 <mikev> i've stopped checking new releases for years now
16:12:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> sorry dreddybajs.
16:13:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> the last time i was at material world records they had some new LIES releases

16:15:47 <dreddybajs> fucker
16:15:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> i want this LIES logo as a tattoo https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/Ci64Vr3v/Screen%20Shot%202022-03-05%20at%2011.13.39%20AM.png

16:19:53 <dreddybajs> gonna be playing a first to 5 street fighter match on this stream
16:19:57 <dreddybajs> in probably an hour or so
16:20:04 <mikev> i will be at da gym then
16:20:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> about 10lbs
16:20:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> which i have now shed
16:21:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> + a lb or two
16:21:25 <the_tasteful_nerd> sittin at around 164 trying to get to 160
16:21:53 <mikev> i have gone from 150ish to 154
16:22:00 <mikev> i guess this is a month now?
16:22:03 <mikev> i don't remember
16:22:08 <the_tasteful_nerd> whend u start
16:22:17 <mikev> first week of classes so like feb 1
16:22:19 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah i did like 10lbs in 3 months roughly
16:22:43 <the_tasteful_nerd> some of that weight u got is probably just water weight+increased glycogen storage 
16:24:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> it comes on quick at first and then itll slow

16:48:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> Thornton Jones, a lawyer in Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales, woke up to find that he had his throat slit. Motioning for a paper and pencil, he wrote, "I dreamt that I had done it. I awoke to find it true," and died 80 minutes later. He had done it himself while unconscious.[150] An inquest at Bangor delivered a verdict of "suicide while temporarily insane".[151]
16:48:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> also hate it when that happens

16:50:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> Nicholas Comper, an aviator and aircraft designer, was attempting to light a firework in Hythe, Kent, when a passerby enquired what he was doing; Comper replied that he was an IRA man planning to blow up the town hall. The passerby knocked down Comper, who hit his head on the curb.[156]
16:51:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> Comper
16:53:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> 	Basil Brown, 48, a health food advocate from Croydon, England, died from liver damage after he consumed 70 million units of Vitamin A and around 10 US gallons (38 litres) of carrot juice over ten days, turning his skin bright yellow.[172][173][174]
