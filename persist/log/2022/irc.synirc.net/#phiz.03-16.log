00:02:52 <Nude_Riker> homemade kvass, sick Homie_in_a_geod 
00:02:53 <Nude_Riker> er HellaBrad 
00:04:21 <HellaBrad> a large glass of it seems to have enough alcohol to actually get me drunk, which seems insane
00:07:05 <Selfie_Dad> interesting
00:07:14 <Selfie_Dad> most kvass is in the like 2.5%-3% range
00:07:37 <scoop_jackson> .seen y
00:07:37 <Selfie_Dad> my man made some Imperial Kvass
00:07:47 <scoop_jackson> .seen w
00:08:44 <HellaBrad> haha yeah i was expecting it to be much lighter but then i stood up after finishing around 500mls of it and went "whoa"
00:11:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> dreddybajs: question 1: if i attack an opponent with 2 copies of rat colony (2/1 and get +1/0 for each other rat) and they block one, which will kill that one, do they take 2 or 3 damage
00:11:53 <Selfie_Dad> .gis rut
00:11:58 <Selfie_Dad> .gis rut rat
00:13:10 <alansmithee_> 3 unless the blocker has first strike
00:13:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> brad do you have all the vampy survivors chievos
00:13:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hm it appears i cannot play elden ring any longer https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/PUjP0dkZ/image.png
00:14:24 <alansmithee_> i got the new ones. the new board is wild
00:14:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> dreddybajs: question 2: if i have a carrion grub (gets +x/+0 where x is highest power among creatures in graveyard) on the battlefield and a lord of extinction (*/*, power equal to number of cards in all graveyards) in my graveyard along with 9 other cards in there, does the carrion grub get +10/0 from the lord of extinction or does it count as a 0/0 in there
00:14:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah alan but i'm not sure what its purpose is
00:14:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you can't coin farm or anything
00:15:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh, unless you're talking about stage 3 and not the bonus level
00:15:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> alansmithee_: thanks i was pretty sure that was it re the rats but not certain
00:15:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> stage 3 got me the first couple times i attempted to play but i figured it out by my third attempt
00:16:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> i also am pretty sure the lord of extinction thing works because of it being */* rather than 0/0 with addons but not certain either
00:16:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like the pentagram evo
00:18:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't think i like the map
00:18:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> finding the items in the library was a fun surprise
00:18:29 <alansmithee_> Homie_in_a_geod: i believe it's a 0/0 in the yard but i'm not 100% sure on that one
00:18:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the map takes that away entirely
00:18:56 <alansmithee_> shrimp1989dspinfo: it's ok. i don't like the upgrade, and you waste a lot of xp until the point it's good
00:19:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like that the upgrade sucks up all the gems for you
00:19:27 <dreddybajs> Homie_in_a_geod: 3, the rats will only stop existing after damage is dealt, when state based actions are checked
00:19:30 <alansmithee_> new map you can't really farm but it's also only 15 minutes. and i think they give you one upgrade? 
00:19:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah, one upgrade
00:19:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i just don't understand its purpose
00:19:47 <dreddybajs> Homie_in_a_geod: */* keeps its power across zones
00:19:52 <alansmithee_> it's just goofy
00:19:54 <dreddybajs> but stuff like uhh.... nighthawk scavenger doesnt
00:19:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah that’s what i thought
00:19:59 <dreddybajs> kind of a weird rule
00:20:03 <alansmithee_> ahh see i was wrong on that one
00:20:05 <dreddybajs> sorry that took me so long i was fighting a Boss
00:20:07 <alansmithee_> i knew some stuff didn't keep tracking
00:20:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like the idea of passive enemies but i don't see it as something i'd want to replay
00:20:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> that’s ok
00:20:12 <alansmithee_> what boss? 
00:20:23 <dreddybajs> valiant gargoyle, i went in with no flasks lol
00:20:27 <dreddybajs> in nokron
00:20:36 <alansmithee_> i don't know if i've fought him yet lol
00:21:02 <eric> im wearing a fresh pair of jeans
00:21:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> because of this i’m wondering if i should jam lord of extinction in my grist deck but not sure. the deck really wants insects
00:21:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> one thing i could really use is a discard outlet
00:22:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> grats on the jeans
00:22:42 <dreddybajs> alansmithee_ Homie_in_a_geod: basically the way it works is, if the creature has defined P/T in the lower right, the ability only works on the battlefield, but if knowing the creature's P/T anywhere (aka it has *) needs to be known by the ability, it works everywhere
00:22:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i hjaven't worn jeans in probably about a decade now
00:22:55 <dreddybajs> due to the ability*
00:23:04 <dreddybajs> whoa
00:23:06 <dreddybajs> jean hater
00:23:19 <dreddybajs> im gonna chill on d sicord and stream Elden Ring if anyone wants to hang out
00:23:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> denim feels bad
00:23:27 <dreddybajs> u can quiz me on mtg rules Homie_in_a_geod 
00:23:41 <dreddybajs> what about softer denims like s tretchy jeans
00:23:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> nope
00:23:56 <alansmithee_> i'll probably hop on in a bit dreddybajs. got in a bit of elden last night so i'm gonna get on for more
00:24:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't feel well and will be passing on vc again tonight
00:24:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> sorry gamers
00:24:30 <dreddybajs> no worries
00:24:32 <dreddybajs> sorry to hear shrimp1989dspinfo 
00:24:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> actually i guess i have a pair of jeggings i wear when i ride my bike when it's cooler but mostly i jsut wear athletic shorts
00:24:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but they're not denim
00:24:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't think they count
00:25:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's the only time i wear pants outside my home
00:25:41 <HellaBrad> shrimp1989dspinfo feel better soon, i dont have all the vampy chievs yet but im working on my last 10 or sp
00:25:45 <HellaBrad> so*
00:25:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> thanks bros
00:25:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have all of them
00:25:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have 44 hours in this stupid game
00:26:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> whenever a new update is pushed i just play til i get all the chievos nand then i ignore it until next update
00:26:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> bonegar also has all the chievos iirc
00:26:46 <HellaBrad> i logged like an earnest 11 hours in the browser-based version before i was like "i should probably just buy this huh"
00:26:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there's a browser version?
00:27:16 <HellaBrad> yeah on the itch page i think you can play a public earlier beta of it
00:27:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> huh
00:27:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've only looked at itchio like 2 times
00:27:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i boguht uhh
00:27:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> night of the consumers? after i watched someone play
00:27:52 <HellaBrad> https://poncle.itch.io/vampire-survivors
00:27:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because he was really bad at it and i figured i'd be better
00:27:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i was not better
00:28:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh neat
00:29:39 <HellaBrad> night of the consumers looks sick
00:29:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's ok
00:31:35 <HellaBrad> im just hardwired to love those chunky quake-2-era polygons and textures
00:32:02 <Selfie_Dad> pewp
00:32:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah, it looks cool, but the mechanics are kind of frustrating
00:32:44 <HellaBrad> the monster shoppers look too fast for me
00:33:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you just have to try and memorize the aisles
00:33:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you can avoid them/hide in the breakroom
00:33:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but if they do get you you can just run quickly to the aisle and it's fine
00:36:14 <HellaBrad> read that as hide in the bathroom first and was like "wow, realism, this dev gets it"
00:36:31 <HellaBrad> once you reach the level with the dread Manager boss not even the breakroom is safe
00:36:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> murder manager
00:39:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> in 7 days i will play rune factory 5
00:39:39 <HellaBrad> a new era of industrialized runes looms on the horizon...
00:39:56 <HellaBrad> tbh very little mechanization in those games for having "factory" in the title
00:39:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> can't wait
00:40:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i hope i don't have much work to do that day
00:40:21 <bonegar> finally got past the valiant gargs
00:40:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> grats
00:43:20 <dreddybajs> nice bonegar 
00:44:23 <dreddybajs> i feel like the next thing u do right after that is very bonegar

02:13:04 <dreddybajs> hell yes
02:13:33 <dreddybajs> apparently the best ps5 experience is to play the ps4 version of elden lol 
02:13:37 <dreddybajs> best framerates 
02:15:45 <dreddybajs> just saw a really good elden message
02:15:51 <dreddybajs> in front of a snail: slug , but house?
02:16:18 <greatest_gamer> lmao is that so
02:16:27 <greatest_gamer> so what you’re saying is that i should have just got it for ps4
02:16:32 <greatest_gamer> and i did this for nothing
02:16:41 <dreddybajs> no i think the ps5 plays the ps4 version a lot better than ps4 does
02:16:41 <dreddybajs> lol
02:16:46 <greatest_gamer> o
02:16:50 <greatest_gamer> that’s just strange
02:16:58 <dreddybajs> yea
02:17:07 <dreddybajs> my fuck of a friend is very happy with his 3090 
02:17:12 <dreddybajs> and his constant 60 fps
02:17:23 <dreddybajs> to be fair he is a machine learning engineer so
02:17:27 <greatest_gamer> ya but he has to sit at a cum crusted pc desk to play games
02:17:28 <dreddybajs> still fuck him
02:17:31 <dreddybajs> lol
02:17:36 <greatest_gamer> i sit on a beautiful couch with my feet up
02:17:42 <dreddybajs> no its his insane work rig with a threadripper 
02:17:58 <greatest_gamer> are those even good for games
02:18:00 <dreddybajs> hes one of the guys who works on the LeelaChess bot
02:18:02 <greatest_gamer> i never looked
02:18:04 <dreddybajs> i dont think so
02:18:11 <greatest_gamer> yeah doubt it
02:18:20 <dreddybajs> i think thats his work rig and his pc rig, which sits beside it, is a 3080 and whatever i9
02:18:35 <greatest_gamer> the intel xeons are fucking dogshit in anything but a server
02:18:49 <dreddybajs> guy bought his own apt at like age 25, bought a tesla that he never uses, and now just upgrades his pc every week
02:18:59 <dreddybajs> gaming rig* rather than pc
02:19:15 <greatest_gamer> it sounds like his wealth should be redistributed involuntarily
02:19:20 <dreddybajs> hes also gay and doesnt want kids so thats his disposable income for life
02:19:24 <dreddybajs> lol agreed
02:19:41 <dreddybajs> i guess i didnt need to specify gay there just the latter part
02:19:43 <dreddybajs> but, hes gay.
02:19:55 <greatest_gamer> i do vibe with that i feel extremely rich all the time because i do not and will not have children

11:32:14 <Selfie_Dad> need to replace the glasses that got broken but i should probably have an optometrist visit first
12:17:38 <Nude_Riker> our software dev and website team all work like 6-2 and i think its specifically to avoid afternoon questions
12:18:19 <Nude_Riker> Many big big men Russian businessmen dey suffer sanctions based on Russia 🇷🇺 invasion of Ukraine
12:18:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't blame the team for doing that
12:25:33 <Selfie_Dad> no, sounds good to me
12:25:51 <Selfie_Dad> afternoon questions ftl
12:26:05 <Nude_Riker> i dont blame them either just funny that its all of them
12:26:12 <Selfie_Dad> theyre smart
12:26:28 <Nude_Riker> our team is not allowed to do that, due to posted support hours
12:26:29 <Nude_Riker> ftl
12:26:57 <Nude_Riker> shower tim
12:27:56 <Selfie_Dad> omfg all this road work makes my fuckin morning commute take forever
12:29:06 <Selfie_Dad> lane closures suck my ass
12:30:13 <the`shima> they've introduced a bunch of changes to the main road that runs across the east side of the city here
12:30:33 <the`shima> and basically now none of the supporting roads can access it because the traffic signals are all off and shit
12:31:20 <the`shima> without traffic it takes me two minutes to get on that road and on my way. last few weeks it's taken me 30 minutes and most of that is sitting there watching lights go green but i can't actually move forward. happens for three cycles or so
12:38:55 <Selfie_Dad> i  have to cross the main highway to get on the northbound side coming out of daycare and the lane closure starts right at that exit
12:39:56 <Selfie_Dad> so everyones merging down to a steady stream of traffic
12:40:06 <Selfie_Dad> and theres no lights so theres never a break
12:40:15 <Selfie_Dad> and you basically just have to wait for someone to have mercy on you
12:54:27 <Nude_Riker> Victoria Beckham is believed to be prioritising her family after her son Cruz split from Bliss Chapman

15:10:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> if you have karmic justice (https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/details.aspx?multiverseid=31872) and a creature with auras on it, and someone destroys that creature, do you get triggers on the karmic justice
15:11:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> i'm assuming no but not certain
15:11:24 <alansmithee_> no
15:11:50 <dreddybajs> nope

15:12:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> if someone were to cleansing nova enchantment mode you would though
15:12:19 <dreddybajs> they aren't destroyed, they're moved to the graveyard during state-based actions

15:23:49 <bonegar> the simpsonfied joe rogan is really funny looking
15:24:12 <bonegar> it's also funny to me that they're both bald.. but i'm sure the episode is very bad
15:24:20 <alansmithee_> i still can't believe the simpsons is still going
15:24:22 <bonegar> it would be funnier if they became bald guy friends
15:24:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> i know this isnt exactly a fresh take but present day simpsons is so fucking bad lol
15:25:03 <bonegar> some things need to be re-affirmed
15:25:17 <Selfie_Dad> bonegar laughing hysterically at every curb your enthusiasm episode because larry is bald

15:30:33 <ajj2> my lifestyle determines my cringestyle

15:33:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think that one is supposed to be funny
15:33:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> the simpsons one is though, which i think makes it worse

19:23:13 <dreddybajs> https://twitter.com/_MenaRD__/status/1503909913642389507 this question is so stupid
19:24:44 <eric> Rave to the grave
19:25:43 <antiracist_baby> daigo was not in his prime during sf4
19:26:17 <antiracist_baby> are we envisioning that you time travel like 2004 daigo to 2009
19:27:37 <dreddybajs> idk, he was still doing really well in sf4 especially later on in usf4 vd arguably bigger and better fields
19:27:45 <dreddybajs> you could argue either way i guess
19:27:59 <mandarin_toni> i tgouhjt daigo was a character in the game and was like this is a very stupid thing to ponder
19:28:27 <dreddybajs> but my answer anyway is that daigo probably is more likely to have a brain aneurysm during the set than lebron
19:28:38 <dreddybajs> which is the only way anyone is beating either of them
19:28:54 <mandarin_toni> i cant beat anyone at anything
19:29:33 <dreddybajs> i wanna start playing club chess and get owned by 12 year olds
19:40:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> dreddybajs: are you allowed to beat the other person up
19:40:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> i would reckon it would be easier to beat daigo up
19:42:03 <antiracist_baby> if prime also means prime physical condition then i imagine theres more chance of lebron experiencing a freak injury than there is of daigo idk
19:42:17 <antiracist_baby> although prime lebron is probably healthier than prime daigo but doing physical things is more risky
19:42:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> im going to beat daigo up.
19:45:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh my god https://twitter.com/DallasTexasTV/status/1504157531450580997
19:45:45 <antiracist_baby> he would do a ninja move on you

19:46:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> jesus christ
19:47:11 <antiracist_baby> lmfao
19:47:12 <dreddybajs> btw i marked out for jeff hardy coming out in aew but damn he didnt look like he can wrestle anymore
19:47:12 <antiracist_baby> im guessing this guy is a republican
19:48:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> i do not know what this guys political affiliation is
19:48:41 <HellaBrad> i feel like anybody could potentially guess an effective fighting move combo but very few people could potentially fluke a three-pointer against lebron
19:48:59 <antiracist_baby>  an effective fighting move combo
19:49:09 <HellaBrad> fighting game* move
19:49:16 <dreddybajs> i mean no, nobody would have a chance at taking a round let alone win a first to 10 match
19:49:17 <scoop_jackson> holy shit tom
19:49:28 <mandarin_toni> its just mashing buttons randomly
19:49:40 <dreddybajs> i think the only useful thing about the question is it frames that basketball you first need to win the genetic lottery to even be able to compete against lebron
19:49:41 <HellaBrad> yeah nobody is winning in either scenario we can agree on that
19:49:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> they might get a hit in on him, like, once maybe
19:49:51 <antiracist_baby> i could see someone taking a round by being impossible to read
19:49:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> but no one is scoring a single point on lebron
19:49:53 <dreddybajs> whereas anyone could maybe practice enough to beat daigo in street fighter
19:49:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
19:50:01 <HellaBrad> its just whose chances are infinitesimally better
19:50:15 <dreddybajs> yeah i think they're both literally zero % lol
19:50:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> clearly its a good question we're all talking about it
19:50:23 <mandarin_toni> also video games are for children so technically youd be fighting a child instead of a large adult man like lrbon
19:50:27 <dreddybajs> but there is the extra genetic thing as a barrier to entry with basketball
19:50:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> toni has a point.
19:50:36 <mandarin_toni> london review of bookson james
19:50:46 <antiracist_baby> reaction times are at least informed by genetics arent they
19:51:02 <Nude_Riker> yes there are those same limits they just have less immediate impact
19:51:18 <Nude_Riker> like if your hands are fucked up you arent gonna be able to input well enough
19:51:35 <antiracist_baby> well they said an average person
19:51:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> i never saw this i want to be ninja video before
19:51:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> this is good
19:52:33 <het> lmfao that is Prime Time Alex Stein
19:52:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> who is that
19:53:36 <het> he's a guy who was on several reality shows
19:53:56 <dreddybajs> i guess but i dont think reaction times are really a factor in this equation
19:53:58 <het> he was on an ABC big brother ripoff called The Glass House and I think Worst Cooks in America and I think there's more?
19:54:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> i see
19:54:20 <het> like the kind of guy who would aspire to be on numerous reality shows
19:54:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> cool lane to be in
19:54:48 <HellaBrad> i think its like 0.000137 % vs 0.00165% where its like the winning scenario is lebron slips on your flop sweat and breaks his ankle but is forced by the laws of the hypothetical to continue playing vs diago pinches a nerve in his neck when he turns to look over at you and gloat & goes temporarily blind
19:55:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> those are very specific numbers.
19:55:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think i could beat lebron even on a freshly broken ankle
19:55:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i want to be ninja is really funny and my roommate and i sang it to each other for months
19:55:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this is gonna be stuck in my head again
19:55:57 <HellaBrad> im just thinking lebron knows how to fall over versus daigo cant possibly train any kind of defense against pinching the optic nerve
19:56:01 <mandarin_toni> id try to fake a foul
19:56:17 <antiracist_baby> if we assume a mean average level of familiarity with street fighter vs a mean average level of familiarity with basketball given what, the world population
19:56:24 <antiracist_baby> then you have a better cahnce against lebron i think
19:56:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> the asian woman looking extremely uncomfortable in this vid ftw
19:56:40 <antiracist_baby> the hypthetical average person would i mean
19:56:43 <dreddybajs> i think you have a better chance vs daigo lol
19:56:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jDHRW6fngg
19:56:53 <dreddybajs> if youre not 7 feet tall how are you ever doing anything vs lebron

20:59:05 <eric> It's important that we face the true reality of evil in the world around us and that's why it's important we don't censor the vile words of Darksyde Phil
20:59:44 <eric> Do you think we'll one day get a tell all about why dr disrespect was banned from twitch 
21:00:35 <eric> I bet the reality is boring 
21:01:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he reached a settlement with twitch so i assume they did something wrong
21:02:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it probably is boring though yeah
21:03:27 <ajj2> i think the speculation is that when a bunch of other top streamers were jumping ship to Mixer they offered him a huge payday to stay 
21:03:43 <eric> Mixer
21:03:44 <ajj2> then when mixer completely crashed and burned they tried to weasel out of it by banning him 
21:03:50 <eric> lol wtf
21:04:09 <eric> i doubt thats the case
21:04:21 <eric> that seems very poorly considered on twitches part
21:05:24 <ajj2> it does
21:06:44 <eric> i wouldnt be surprised if it has something to do with a third party though like an advertiser

23:43:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> maris is the only one who eats normally
23:43:27 <HellaBrad> definitely saturn's most active time of day, he patrols all exits and entrances to the kitchen to make sure nobody disturbs the ritual once he hears the tin of wet food open
23:43:33 <Selfie_Dad> sounds like you're enabling claire.
23:43:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i love her
23:43:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wet food is cat lunch

23:44:16 <Melber> Why do you do it like that shrimp1989dspinfo 
23:44:25 <Selfie_Dad> hmm i dont think thats beer so, its not as bad as i initially expected
23:44:28 <Melber> My cat is, inexplicably, still alive
23:44:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> peter used to be really fat and i have to control his eating
23:44:40 <dreddybajs> kewl np shrimp1989dspinfo 
23:44:42 <Melber> Nah it's a slushie. Though... It could still be beer 
23:44:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's still large but he's not 22lbs
23:44:52 <dreddybajs> ya sounds good HellaBrad ill pop on in a bit
23:45:12 <Melber> Throw a jream in the freezer and I assume you'd basically get that 
23:45:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the other two are fine but i can't free feed because peter's always trying to eat osmething
23:45:41 <HellaBrad> yeah if i dont watch saturn he will finish his food extra fast so he can bully his sisters away from their dishes
23:47:48 <Selfie_Dad> Melber: i have... acquired... the kneesovertoes guy's paid program materials so remind me to share that w/ you because i think he has some good stuff that can help you work on the knee pain
23:48:05 <HellaBrad> comet in particular is happy to give him her meals because she thinks the tiny pieces of cardboard she hunts are real food https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/njgOo2rb/20220315_231208.jpg
