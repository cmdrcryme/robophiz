00:24:03 <registered_mirc> yeah i think that's true
00:24:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> a couple people in the comments said it's hl2 deathmatch so

01:40:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> hoping that the marinade of the steak we are having tonight will not have added significant caloric content
01:40:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> becauase i am just going to plug in 'flank steak' and hope thats good enough
01:42:40 <HellaBrad> yeah you dont have to worry about marinade, 30 cals at most id say
01:45:34 -!- mpg [~void@B0650E17.4518A346.2DB44557.IP] has joined #phiz
01:49:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmao the rangers scored 4 in a row after going down 2-0 in the first
01:49:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> woot
01:50:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol
01:51:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ah shit the game on tuesday is at 1030p
01:51:33 <the_chasteful_turd> if the marinade is oil heavy id just log like half a tbsp of oil to get in the ballpark
01:51:46 <the_chasteful_turd> or if it has sugar id just log the sugar
01:52:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> this one has red wine mainly
01:52:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> and herbs
01:52:13 <the_chasteful_turd> those are the only things that really move the needle in a marinade
01:52:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> im just gonna log it as steak idk\
01:52:31 <the_chasteful_turd> https://www.instagram.com/reel/CbAzu21AMjB/?utm_medium=copy_link
01:52:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think the meatballs we made this week are overestimated on fat because it logs in the raw meat
01:54:12 <NORG> Funky like a chunky monkeh
01:55:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> i logged the meat in these meatballs as 50% ground beef and 50% ground pork but they were actually 25% ground beef and 75% bolognese blend from the butcher which is some combo of beef/pork/veal
01:55:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i think all of it is a lot leaner than what is in the app, disregarding even the amount that obviously cooks off
01:56:21 <the_chasteful_turd> yeah meat is trickier if you dont know exactly how lean
01:56:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> no real way of knowing with the ground stuff from the butcher i dont think
01:57:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> ill just give myself a little more leeway on days where i eat stuff where i think thats applicable i guess
01:58:56 <the_chasteful_turd> yeah and the calorie target is really the important one
02:07:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/x4yJcRxj/20220312_210715.jpg

02:08:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh yeah it is
02:08:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i turned the brightness down
02:08:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol
02:12:08 <Brad_Feet> "turn your rgb down, it's upsetting the cat"
02:12:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
02:12:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> don‚Äôt think i actually ate this much fat today but whatever https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/3iPYUcln/IMG_8209.PNG
02:12:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> massively under on carbs every day is kind of cool i guess
02:13:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> i actually feel full today for once
02:13:42 <bonegar> where are you getting most of your fats?
02:21:57 <ajj> thats what my roomies did, cut carbs mostly 
02:22:45 <mpg> [kevin gates voice] fats fats fats fats fats
02:24:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> bonegar: today it was mostly from the meatballs i mentioned before
02:24:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> steak dinner had less
02:25:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> leftover (homemade) pizza had some from the cheese on it but i didn‚Äôt really put too much on this time
02:26:10 <bonegar> yah just noticed you said you were meeting your fat goals a lot more quickly than other cals
02:26:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> yup
02:27:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> earlier this week it made sense seeing as our leftovers were carnitas and mac & cheese so both very fatty
02:28:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> i still think it‚Äôs overshooting but even still it‚Äôs pretty tough to get as much protein as it asks for without also getting a lot of fat, and the fat goal is much lower than the other ones
02:36:16 <bonegar> yeah there are only a few high protein low fat options in general i think
02:36:51 <bonegar> mostly fish and lean cuts
02:36:59 <mpg> just downloaded a docu called mystery of the carpathian sphinx
02:37:04 <mpg> sounds fucking sik
02:37:38 <bonegar> then maybe some beans, and maybe some yogurts that are reduced fat
02:37:49 <mpg> eat the beans
02:39:50 <bonegar> shrimp is good too, oyster
02:45:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> i‚Äôve never really cooked seafood apart from putting shrimp in a gumbo
02:46:14 <bonegar> yea it can be a bit daunting.. i also think tilapia is gross
02:46:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> i‚Äôve always sort of been afraid to cook fish
02:46:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> always think i‚Äôm going to screw it up
02:46:33 <bonegar> yea it can be expensive and easy to mess up
02:46:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
02:46:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> underdone or overdone fish are both terrible and the window is very tight
02:46:55 <bonegar> but nothing wrong with some canned tuna and frozen shrimp imo
02:47:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> canned tuna is very gross to me
02:47:12 <bonegar> yeah and getting a good chunk of like halibut is pricey
02:48:03 <bonegar> i'm pretty ok with tuna salad sandwich with some kewpie mayo and diced jalapeno pickles and onion, but by itself it's pretty blegh
02:48:29 <bonegar> i think if you do some foil baked whitefish to keep in the moisture it can be pretty easy
02:48:48 <bonegar> but soucing seafood is hard in general i think

13:53:59 <Nude_Riker> pune?
13:57:07 <Nude_Riker> i told myself this weekend i would plan my move somewhat... not sure about that right now
14:00:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> b
14:01:32 <bonegar> did you pick a place to move to?
14:01:37 <bonegar> also yea 'pune'
14:03:30 <Nude_Riker> bonegar, well, back in with my parents. i mean the logistics, dates and such
14:03:39 <bonegar> well...
14:03:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> we were supposed to go to ikea today but the thing we want is out of stock as is uh, apparently almost everything else at ikea
14:04:18 <bonegar> i guess what i mean to say is, if you pick a place to move into, then you'll have a set move in date and you can plan everything around that
14:04:23 <bonegar> that's what i'd do, i guess
14:04:57 <the_chasteful_turd> pune
14:05:03 <bonegar> was just saying this
14:05:05 <Nude_Riker> i have a place to move in to, and the date is "before my lease expires"
14:05:09 <the_chasteful_turd> rip ikea
14:05:21 <bonegar> is it your mom's place?
14:05:35 <Nude_Riker> it is my mom and dad's place in hood river
14:05:38 <bonegar> you're not understanding what i'm saying i guess.
14:05:45 <Nude_Riker> i guess not
14:05:51 <bonegar> no prob
14:06:41 <bonegar> is this just property own or do they live there
14:06:45 <the_chasteful_turd> need moe cofey
14:06:49 <bonegar> they
14:06:52 <bonegar> pune
14:07:06 <the_chasteful_turd> june?
14:07:22 <Nude_Riker> it is the home they own and live in, which i lived in until moving to los angeles
14:07:35 <the_chasteful_turd> .gis give it up for your boys
14:08:41 <bonegar> i'd probably break my lease and move and not get my deposit back
14:09:19 <Nude_Riker> they were supposed to be mostly on the boat for the forseeable future so i would have it to myself, but last week my mom said actually they're selling the boat now
14:09:44 <bonegar> lol
14:09:48 <bonegar> is that a hint?
14:09:50 <Nude_Riker> so, not as Stoked about this as i was
14:10:08 <Nude_Riker> no, they will be happy to have me around
14:10:44 <Nude_Riker> whether i am happy to be around them idk, same for having the cats around them, remains to be seen
14:11:39 <bonegar> sounds like a nightmare to me but every family is different and i have to respect this

14:12:35 <Nude_Riker> no idea where i will go after moving back in with them, cant afford anywhere in hood river anymore
14:12:58 <bonegar> this is why i think you should consider finding a place to live
14:13:23 <Nude_Riker> hopefully i can have a nice summer of being with all my hometown friends at least
14:14:10 <bonegar> everything you are saying is very worrying to me lmao sorry i'll hush

15:21:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> yes
15:22:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> ate small bacon egg n cheese for breakfast and already at half of allowed fat for the day
15:23:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> we are having fish for dinner at least so probably not much fat there
15:24:11 <mpg> im about to chug a red bull and get into some elden ring
15:24:17 <mpg> sunday baby
15:24:32 <bonegar> d&d was cancelled so i might go for a drive and a hike soon
15:24:46 <mpg> wow looks like someone's ready to "touch grass"
15:25:20 <mpg> wish it was easier for me to go on a hike, but alas i chose this city life
15:25:24 <bonegar> im always touching grass
15:25:31 <mpg> me too except its weed
15:25:35 <bonegar> it's very funny when people try to 'own' me by telling me to touch grass
15:25:48 <bonegar> 100% chance i've touched more grass than them, not even a question
15:25:51 <mpg> i'm sure you are aware that i was not actually trying to own you
15:26:15 <bonegar> ya that's why i said people and used the ' 
15:26:53 <bonegar> 'you must be fun at parties' 
15:28:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> .gis pickle hole
15:28:29 <mpg> i wish someone said that to me but it's never happened because i am obviously fun at parties
15:28:31 <bonegar> im supposed to go with a friend but they 'overslept' and 'need to shower'
15:28:46 <mpg> gotta shower to go outside
15:28:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> pun at farties
15:29:06 <bonegar> i think you hang around more suburban boomers you'll hear it
15:29:14 <mpg> ooof
15:29:28 <bonegar> it's their stock phrase
15:29:46 <mpg> put me in a wood coffin laser engraved with live laugh love
15:30:17 <bonegar> im annoyed because i want to go outside now, but i have to wait for someone who is currently not communicating
15:30:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> you can ‚Äútouch grass‚Äù if you want; i will be ‚Äútouching ass‚Äù
15:30:35 <mpg> that's what i always say
15:30:58 <bonegar> yea i bet you like touching yourself a lot har har
15:31:56 <scoop_jackson> i too overslept and need to shower

15:37:02 <the_chasteful_turd> 11:22:48 AM <Homie_in_a_geod> ate small bacon egg n cheese for breakfast and already at half of allowed fat for the day
15:37:09 <the_chasteful_turd> your allowed to eat more fat than that.

15:41:52 <antiracist_baby> https://twitter.com/shidahikaru/status/1499962879390494724
15:41:57 <the_chasteful_turd> tom i think you should create a new macro program and choose low carb and medium protein if the fat level is bugging you too much
15:42:00 <antiracist_baby> I'm back to kick the ass!
15:43:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> the_chasteful_turd: idk i‚Äôm trying to wait until i have a fucking scale to adjust anything
15:43:47 <the_chasteful_turd> well yeah but hear me out
15:43:58 <bonegar> owning a scale isn't going to adjust that
15:44:12 <the_chasteful_turd> eating in a deficit gets a bit tougher as time goes on
15:44:31 <the_chasteful_turd> so the idea is to do the least amount to get results at the outset, knowing that you might have to ratchet up a bit later
15:44:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> actually owning a scale and giving the app weight measurements will in fact adjust things bonegar
15:44:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> that‚Äôs the way the app works
15:45:01 <the_chasteful_turd> so since we have no real idea whether you need to be eating as low as 1600 cals a day you might as well give yourself some breathing room
15:45:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i can‚Äôt give it those yet
15:45:11 <the_chasteful_turd> until you get the tools you need to have all the info
15:45:56 <the_chasteful_turd> i think 2000 cals is probably more than adequate at the moment and let yourself eat some more fat if you feel like it
15:45:58 <bonegar> i know you're frusterated but it sounds like you're making it harder for yourself
15:46:28 <the_chasteful_turd> the thing adjusts every monday based on the data but its not obv doing that yet because of no weight info
15:46:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> i‚Äôm not actually that frustrated right now
15:46:37 <bonegar> i dont see how weighing things would change the content of a BEC to be higher protein
15:46:54 <the_chasteful_turd> thats not what we're talking about here
15:46:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> i don‚Äôt know what you think you‚Äôre arguing against
15:47:14 <bonegar> you're mad about getting in too much fat and then you started talking about not having a scale
15:47:16 <the_chasteful_turd> yeah. we're talking about a bathroom scale to measure the weight of a human
15:47:22 <the_chasteful_turd> not food.
15:47:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> i‚Äôm not mad about anything
15:47:25 <bonegar> OOoooh
15:47:26 <antiracist_baby> https://twitter.com/andysignore/status/1424696120006123522
15:47:29 <bonegar> i thought he was weighing his food
15:47:30 <bonegar> lmao
15:47:30 <antiracist_baby> what band is this soyfacing guy wearing
15:47:31 <bonegar> omg
15:47:32 <bonegar> ok
15:47:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> i‚Äôm weighing my food and i do have a scale
15:47:53 <bonegar> then i dont really understand anything about what you're trying to do at all
15:48:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have a scale for my food
15:48:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> i don‚Äôt have a scale for my person
15:48:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> why is this confusing
15:48:23 <the_chasteful_turd> the app adjusts your calories by calculating your TDEE using how many calories you eat and what your weigh-ins are
15:48:25 <bonegar> i dont own a scale
15:48:28 <the_chasteful_turd> but w/o the scale to do weigh ins it cant do that
15:48:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> ok congrats i guess
15:48:36 <the_chasteful_turd> thats what we're alking about
15:48:39 <bonegar> that's why it's confusing
15:48:40 <bonegar> you asked
15:48:40 <the_chasteful_turd> I Don't Even Own A Scale
15:48:54 <bonegar> no, just keeping body metrics like that is useless to me
15:49:11 <eric> toms doing something different from you
15:49:13 <the_chasteful_turd> well its sorta required if you want to lose weight and quantify it in anyway
15:49:19 <bonegar> yes im answering why i was confused 
15:49:34 <the_chasteful_turd> if you're happy how you are, then of course you dont need to keep track of any of this shit
15:49:35 <bonegar> itsn ot at all required
15:49:49 <bonegar> in fact it's pretty fucking terrible for many people in my opinion but IF IT WORKS FOR U that's fine
15:50:11 <the_chasteful_turd> you need to be able to quantify SOMETHING if you want your weight to trend down reliably
15:50:31 <the_chasteful_turd> and steadily
15:50:40 <bonegar> i guess like, if you really cannot tell if your body is fat or not and have to rely on a number yea
15:51:06 <the_chasteful_turd> fat vs not fat is a pretty squishy metric vs an actual weight value
15:51:15 <antiracist_baby> whats your three size bonger
15:51:21 <bonegar> lol
15:51:29 <antiracist_baby> i found a very confuysing twitter guy
15:51:31 <antiracist_baby> https://twitter.com/IamTim_Gray/status/1482697933568937984
15:51:37 <antiracist_baby> possibly schizo
15:51:37 <the_chasteful_turd> intuitive eating is a skill and its not acquired overnight
15:51:46 <antiracist_baby> he tweets in 'japanese' that is just garbled characters also
15:51:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> 11:50 AM <bonegar> i guess like, if you really cannot tell if your body is fat or not and have to rely on a number yea
15:52:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> you‚Äôre right the problem is just that i‚Äôm too stupid to understand whether i‚Äôm losing weight and correctly doing habits to cause that to happen
15:52:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> glad we figured this out
15:52:21 <antiracist_baby> youre letting bonegar troll you tom
15:52:31 <the_chasteful_turd> im owning her with logic and facts.
15:52:33 <bonegar> you must be fun at parties

15:53:07 <antiracist_baby> what is going on here
15:53:08 <bonegar> i'm not trolling, i just had very similiar frusterations and a different approach helped me a lot

15:58:55 <bonegar> oh cool, anger makes you fatter
15:59:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> anyway my point in pointing out the fat metrics is just that when i am logging my meals it becomes immediately apparent that things that i was doing before that i considered very normal are pretty much unilaterally resulting in me being told by the app that i am getting too much fat
15:59:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> it is a jarring thing that i‚Äôm not used to and i am taking about that here with my friends
16:01:09 <antiracist_baby> butch

16:19:03 <eric> If you're planning on running the treasures of the past you'll find here on real old Macintosh hardware from the 90's, you sir/madame, deserve to win an Internet! 
16:19:19 <the_chasteful_turd> lol
16:19:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> i‚Äôm trying to use it as a benchmark to figure out portions
16:19:24 <the_chasteful_turd> i love to win an internet
16:19:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> more or less
16:19:31 <the_chasteful_turd> that makes sense
16:19:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/aSrFmoLL/image.png
16:19:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> i don‚Äôt have any kind of intuitive idea about what any given foods distribution of fat to protein to carb is tho
16:20:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> other than like obvious shit ie rice
16:20:06 <the_chasteful_turd> the idea is that the target is what you want to be at on average, so a day where ur under/over by 150 calories is ok
16:20:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> i see
16:20:22 <the_chasteful_turd> and as you go on you can look at like the previous week of data and it will tell you ur avg
16:20:25 <bonegar> yea, getting that knowledge will help a ton, also good pooping vegetables
16:20:33 <Nude_Riker> good poopin ftw
16:20:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> well i think i have already lost a little bit of weight
16:20:48 <bonegar> reverse engineering a good poop is a strong strat
16:20:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think my gut is sagging a bit less
16:21:01 <the_chasteful_turd> and also its no big deal to have a day here and there where ur +500-600 even because then likely you'll just be at maintenance calories
16:21:15 <the_chasteful_turd> and if you were at your target the rest of the week you're still in a deficit over the week
16:21:24 <Nude_Riker> i havent lost any weight being back on keto but my BMs are top notch rn
16:21:43 <the_chasteful_turd> matt's been greasin the skids
16:21:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk i‚Äôm not really freaking out about it like i was before
16:21:56 <bonegar> i ended up with a big bag of adzuki beans so i'm gonna be working a bean angle again
16:22:02 <Nude_Riker> the bean angler
16:22:06 <the_chasteful_turd> yeah after like 2 weeks it starts to settle into routine
16:22:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm making pickled mustard green
16:22:30 <Nude_Riker> i think i will drive out to H-Mart and hope they have a good mushroom selection rn and load up
16:22:31 <Nude_Riker> hell yeah shrimp1989dspinfo 
16:22:33 <bonegar> mustard green ftw
16:22:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have a decent enough idea at this point of like - i can have a decently sized smoothie in the morning, a small sandwich for lunch, and a reasonable portion of whatever we have for dinner and that‚Äôs fine
16:22:38 <bonegar> never pickled them though how's that work
16:22:47 <scoop_jackson> im going to hmart today too
16:22:52 <scoop_jackson> cuz its clsoe to the barber
16:22:52 <Nude_Riker> yeah are you doing a vinegar pickle or a lacto or what
16:23:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> soy sauce, kombu, mirin, rice vinegar, chilis, sugar
16:23:07 <Nude_Riker> yumm
16:23:11 <bonegar> nice
16:23:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/X1kjxrHX/IMG_8210.PNG
16:23:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> mix all that crap in a bag wit hthe mustard greens, put a weight on the bag, let it sit for 24h
16:23:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ez
16:23:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> this has been the whole week
16:23:39 <bonegar> ive only ever eaten the baby mustard greens fresh
16:23:43 <bonegar> never cooked w/ them or anything
16:23:46 <bonegar> .gis mustard greens
16:23:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i love mustard greens
16:23:53 <Nude_Riker> i usually eat mature mustard greens cooked
16:24:06 <bonegar> yea i think that's more common 
16:24:06 <Nude_Riker> theyre great, in all forms
16:24:15 <the_chasteful_turd> yeah i like to plan my stuff out so my biggest meal is dinner
16:24:16 <bonegar> just dunno much about it and YES im interested
16:24:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my biggest meal is lunch
16:24:27 <the_chasteful_turd> having a big meal before bed is better for me i think
16:24:30 <the_chasteful_turd> when im cutting
16:24:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if i eat a big dinner i wake up feeling really bad
16:24:40 <the_chasteful_turd> otherwise i run the risk of being hungry trying to go to sleep
16:24:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like there's glass in my stomach
16:24:48 <the_chasteful_turd> i mean its not like "big"
16:24:53 <the_chasteful_turd> but big in comparison 
16:24:56 <bonegar> i get the 'glass in my stomach' feeling whenever i eat chips
16:24:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> i certainly prefer to have a big dinner just based on what i have normally done for my entire life
16:25:00 <bonegar> ...and i like chips
16:25:03 <the_chasteful_turd> like 900 cals vs 500 cals for the other two
16:25:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i know what oyu mean, i'm using big the same way
16:25:05 <bonegar> and i'm always self harming
16:25:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> chips ftw
16:25:26 <the_chasteful_turd> crisps
16:25:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the glass feeling occurs most frequently for me when i eat hummus
16:25:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have never at any point really been a regular breakfast person and a lot of the time i just forget to eat during the day when i‚Äôm focused on work
16:25:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> or lots of sesame
16:25:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> so dinner is often my only meal and always my largest meal
16:25:49 <Nude_Riker> you know whats a bad dinner? chip dinner
16:25:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wrong
16:26:03 <scoop_jackson> yeah hard for me to get out of the routine that dinner is the only real meal
16:26:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i get hungry around 9am and eat something small
16:26:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like apple or smoothie or w/e
16:26:30 <Nude_Riker> woke up and ate a filet of smoked trout and went back to bed
16:26:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> then lunch is "big" and dinner is a smaller version of lunch
16:26:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> i‚Äôm typically barely even out of bed at 9 if at all
16:26:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i eat snacks too
16:26:45 <antiracist_baby> watching combat zone wrestling tournament of death 2003
16:26:53 <antiracist_baby> first guy come out to disturbed stupify second guy come out to papa roach last resort
16:26:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> cool
16:27:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> "big" lunch is like... salad in a slightly bigger bowl or like a medium bowl of slop or w/e
16:27:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> .y tragg‚Äôs trough
16:27:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> slop ftw
16:27:49 <Nude_Riker> .gis big lunch
16:27:51 <bonegar> i usually eat around 5 for my big meal. very midwestern
16:28:05 <Nude_Riker> .gis big lunch lunchly
16:28:18 <Nude_Riker> ew gross of course lunchly is some meal kit shit
16:28:43 <bonegar> today i ate.. two boiled eggs. and some old crackers. dunno if i'll eat again or not, depends on how the day goes
16:29:04 <the_chasteful_turd> i ate 4 boil egg
16:29:16 <Nude_Riker> today ive et smoked trout, for dinner probably a stir fry thing
16:29:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> can't make pickled mustard greens... out of soy sauce
16:29:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i thought i had another bottle in the closet
16:29:44 <Nude_Riker> RIP

16:30:03 <bonegar> lol
16:30:08 <Nude_Riker> oh right also im going to make chicken stock because i defrosted some 2 year old chicken feet
16:30:10 <eric> i ate cup of coff one toast and yogur

16:31:16 <the_chasteful_turd> old chickenfoot
16:31:20 <the_chasteful_turd> that sounds like a whiskey
16:31:35 <Nude_Riker> lol
16:32:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> why did you buy chicken feet in the first place
16:32:10 <bonegar> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waubonsie_State_Park maybe i'll go here today
16:32:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what were you planning on doing with them
16:32:14 <Nude_Riker> to make stock
16:32:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ohh
16:32:32 <Nude_Riker> but i kept putting off using them because i didnt want to have to clean them
16:32:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> cute park
16:32:49 <Nude_Riker> ive made stock many times in the meantime
16:32:56 <the_chasteful_turd> .l
16:32:58 <Nude_Riker> nice, it features loess
16:33:06 <bonegar> you know i love loess
16:33:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ya i can think of a couple times oyu've mentioned making stock which is why i was asking if you initially had other plans for the feet
16:33:21 <bonegar> Me, and Central China

16:33:33 <the_chasteful_turd> .l cryme
16:33:49 <Nude_Riker> its kind of silly for me to drive this far mostly just for mushrooms, most of the other stuff i would buy there i wont buy because of not eating carbos
16:34:02 <Nude_Riker> but, i will. and hopefully there are other treats for me such as fish eggs
16:34:05 <bonegar> driving far for mushrooms is a Treat Yourself and You Should
16:34:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> where are you going
16:34:10 <bonegar> 1. driving is nice
16:34:13 <bonegar> 2. mushrooms is nice
16:34:23 <bonegar> two nices alone there
16:34:25 <Nude_Riker> driving is nice sometimes, driving through the city and then on the highway isnt
16:34:38 <Nude_Riker> shrimp1989dspinfo, catonsville
16:34:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lotte plaza or hmart
16:34:47 <bonegar> you gotta make of it what you can
16:35:04 <Nude_Riker> i will probably go to both since ill be out there, hmart usually has better mushrooms
16:35:06 <bonegar> ok time for me to finally go BYE
16:35:35 <Nude_Riker> enjoy bonegar 
16:36:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> have fun
16:36:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i usually went to lotte plaza

17:08:18 <the`shima> got this swelling on the back of my neck thats been coming/going for a few months. ive kinda half strained that area a few times over hte past year so i think its muscular
17:08:21 <the_chasteful_turd> doing 4x10 squats today
17:08:28 <the_chasteful_turd> brutal
17:08:50 <the`shima> its also not like a big hard lump and doesnt feel like a gland. feels like its across the muscle fiber when i pinch back of my beck
17:08:53 <mandarin_toni> sounds like fail aids to me
17:09:09 <the`shima> it also seems to be worse after a day on computer so its probably related to that
17:09:32 <mandarin_toni> computers ftl
17:09:46 <het> apparently walmart is having a ps5 event tomorrow, I'm gonna try and get one I think

23:23:55 <mikev> its pc gone mad
23:24:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> In fact, drug use was reportedly prevalent throughout the Nazi Party, and soldiers were often given meth before battle. 
23:24:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we did this as well
23:24:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have definitely lost weight this week because i can more easily bend over to tie my shoes than i could 2 weeks ago
23:24:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> let's not pretend it was only germany
23:25:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/YqKVlFT5/image.png
23:25:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> i know from steve1989mreinfo.com that there was speed in MREs for like most of the 20th century
23:25:30 <the_chasteful_turd> speed ftw
23:25:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yep
23:25:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> its disappointing that steve has never eaten the MRE speed before
23:25:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he should
23:25:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> not on camera at least
23:26:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i bet he uses 100 year old MRE speed as preworkout
23:26:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
23:26:28 <Nude_Riker> the english used the most meth i think, battle of britain alone
23:26:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> In 1939 a Swedish legislator nominated Hitler for the Nobel Peace Prize. Although he intended it as a joke, few found it amusing. 
23:26:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> actually that's very funny
23:26:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> im always jealous of steves 80 year old cigarettes
23:26:38 <Nude_Riker> per soldier i mean
23:26:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think i could smoke those and it wouldnt count as unquitting
23:27:00 <Nude_Riker> i want an aged ciggie
23:27:17 <Nude_Riker> i would love to see steve try old navy rum
23:27:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> cigarettes are fail
23:27:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> theyre very cool
23:27:33 <mikev> lol saad was gonna have a breakaway on the PK
23:27:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i like how tobacco smells
23:27:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> not while burning
23:27:40 <mikev> overskated it and then tripped the guy who fucked up
23:27:44 <mikev> 5 on 3 great
23:27:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> smelling a pack of cigarettes smells like raisins
23:27:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> saad...
23:28:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think one of the biggest fuckups that they did in trying to get kids not to smoke was telling kids that smoking isnt cool, which was the thrust of a lot of the anti smoking stuff we learned in health class and in our health office in school and w/e
23:28:40 <dreddybajs> sup the_chasteful_turd 
23:28:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> how is anyone going to beleive you that cigarettes are bad when people blatantly lie to you like that
23:29:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> when it is so obvious that they are in fact cool
23:29:08 <the_chasteful_turd> accident sorry
23:29:12 <dreddybajs> ok

23:30:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm surprised that vid only has 1m views
23:30:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> idk what ciggies taste like
23:30:21 <mikev> let you do a taste test of some non-harmful substance that tastes like cigs
23:30:51 <the_chasteful_turd> i mean they show u the pic of the tarred up lungs
23:31:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah but they always focused too much on the cancer thing
23:31:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> like yeah cancer is scary but not everyone who smokes gets cancer
23:31:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> but if you smoke enough you absolutely will get copd
23:31:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> cigarettes make you smell bad
23:31:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> they do, that is also true
23:31:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and they make your voice funny
23:31:49 <mikev> it makes your dick smaller
23:31:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and they speed up aging

23:57:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> dreddybajs: when theyre going to shut down traffic or parking in nyc in order to do film shoots they have to put up signs about it in advacne and say what theyre shooting

23:57:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> epic
