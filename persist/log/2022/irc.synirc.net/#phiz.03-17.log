00:29:35 <HellaBrad> no rush, im just hanging out in vc exploring the new vamp survivors level
00:30:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> this is what one serving of takis looks like https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/wg5SKAZG/1647476989.JPG
00:30:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> saddest thing i’ve ever seen
00:31:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
00:31:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> a simple plate of takis
00:31:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you know what's really gay is a serving of hummus is only 2 tbsp
00:31:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> who decided this
00:32:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol thats bullshit
00:32:14 <dreddybajs> i am on the disc cord
00:32:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wehn i was counting i just did 1/4c
00:32:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> bc i was just eating it with carrots anyway
00:32:46 <Selfie_Dad> a serving of hummus is a quarter of the tub
00:32:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ^
00:33:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> whatever freak decided that a serving is 2 tbsp is the same person who decided 12 takis is Enough
00:33:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> that was 10.5 takis actually
00:34:00 <Selfie_Dad> its all calculated so you dont look at the back of the package and go holy shit that's 400 calories
00:34:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i just guessed
00:34:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i didn't count
00:34:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> one small bag of takis is actually 600 calories
00:34:28 <Selfie_Dad> ate is enough
00:34:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> apparently
00:34:35 <Selfie_Dad> lmfao jesus
00:34:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> that right there is 150 cals
00:34:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lately they've started adding the calories in an entire package
00:34:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like every ice cream pint i buy has serving cals and container cals
00:35:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i've started seeing it on snacks as well
00:35:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> tonight we are having spagenty and Meat's Ball

01:20:34 <eric> not enough salt or sugar
01:20:42 <eric> or fish sauce
01:20:57 <eric> but the chicken meatballs are pretty good
01:24:28 <scoop_jackson> i just restocked on fish sauce the other day
01:24:39 <scoop_jackson> i might give that recipe a shot despite your expierience

02:45:53 <NORG> Selfie_Dad it was good
02:46:04 <het> eric: that's good to know about that recipe, I was thinking of making it
02:52:09 <eric> yeah the meatballs are pretty good as is though so you could use that as a protein in a regular thai currey and i think that would be A+
02:56:01 <Selfie_Dad> t
02:57:55 <NORG> would u believe me if i told u the fassbinder was sad

04:09:36 <ajj2> fuuu
04:18:05 <dreddybajs> lol
04:18:13 <dreddybajs> you're better off, it honestly made stuff way too easy
04:18:46 <ajj2> and hoarfrost stomp too
04:18:48 <ajj2> whats epic though is they actually added some new quest npcs and fixed some broken npc quest lines
04:19:16 <dreddybajs> Deleted the Ragged armor set from the game which was mistakenly obtainable in previous patch.
04:19:16 <dreddybajs> ???
04:19:22 <dreddybajs> yea that rocks
04:22:22 <alansmithee_> ajj2 lol yeah that thing was stupid powerful
04:22:54 <eric> i left voice chat but it was nice to chat with u
04:24:52 <dreddybajs> u2 eric
04:25:27 <dreddybajs> Increased shield’s effectiveness.
04:25:29 <dreddybajs> which shield...
04:25:32 <ajj2> lol
04:37:51 <NORG> i've decided to give in to the Hype and begin the show 'Severance'
04:38:07 <dreddybajs> we discussed it at length in 'cord tonite NORG 
04:38:11 <dreddybajs> i may also watch it...
04:38:42 <NORG> heres my discussion addition that was probably said, and agreed upon by everyone: IDK how easy it will be to take adam scott seriously
04:41:14 <dreddybajs> (adam scott reaction gif
04:41:16 <dreddybajs> )
04:42:44 <dreddybajs> In one single patch they've basically rendered me toothless.
04:42:44 <dreddybajs> I was using the Sword of Night and Flame as my main weapon and found the Hoarfrost Stomp skill yesterday.
04:42:44 <dreddybajs> The latter was handy to get rid of trash mobs and the former was very efficient against bosses.
04:42:44 <dreddybajs> Thanks FromSoft, the game was starting to become bearable with my playstyle. I guess i'll have to look for other games to play now because i do not fancy becoming a scrub at the bottom of the food chain again. I had a great time while it lasted.
04:42:47 <dreddybajs> lmfao
04:42:53 <dreddybajs> elden scrub quotes
04:43:12 <dreddybajs> (using the 2 most broken things in the game) it was beginning to become bearable
04:47:59 <ajj2> lmao

13:12:16 <scoop_jackson> well they pulled it off here ;/
13:12:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> here as well
13:12:50 <bonegar> if here was there we wouldn't be in this pickle 
13:15:21 <bonegar> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FOB4_kzXEAEgc6q?format=jpg&name=900x900 lol
13:15:29 <Nude_Riker> it rained this morning but stopped before i took the recycling out
13:15:37 <Nude_Riker> so i walked around the block smelling rain it was nice
13:16:11 <bonegar> we're in a bad drought, dunno if worst on record but driest winter on record or somethin
13:16:35 <Nude_Riker> yeah like 2/3 of the us is in bad drought for years now
13:16:40 <bonegar> every time it has supposed to do moisture a pocket is created and it gets pushed north or south 
13:17:16 <Nude_Riker> im introducing some young people to pictures for sad children
13:17:34 <Nude_Riker> they're shocked that the japanese woman fries and egg and asks about your day comic predates asmr/twitch
13:17:38 <bonegar> yea but this isn't really western USA drought this is midcontinental low/highfront band changes
13:18:11 <bonegar> i remember liking pfsc a lot, i wonder if it held up
13:18:18 <Nude_Riker> i still like it a lot
13:18:45 <bonegar> im not sure i could revisit it, but i remember liking it a lot more than it's contemporaries like KXCD which it got compared to a lot
13:18:46 <Nude_Riker> that interview with the creator recently... i wish it hadnt happened kind of, but glad to know they are alive
13:18:54 <bonegar> XKCD 
13:18:54 <bonegar> w/e
13:19:06 <Nude_Riker> yeah it has nothing to do with xkcd except simplistic art
13:19:13 <bonegar> why did you wish that? what do you mean.
13:19:44 <Nude_Riker> it didnt resolve any questions i had or anything it just kind of reminded me they feel bad
13:19:47 <bonegar> yeah, i think people wanted to showcase how bad the xkcd art was in compared to another simple style
13:19:52 <bonegar> and they were right 
13:19:56 <Nude_Riker> yeah
13:20:08 <bonegar> you had questions?
13:20:28 <Nude_Riker> yeah i guess the biggest was "did you kill yourself" though so that did get answered
13:20:32 <bonegar> i remember the bee thing, vaguely...
13:21:04 <Nude_Riker> wasp but yeah, i got one of the books with a wasp in it
13:21:30 <bonegar> bee wasp w/e
13:21:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what is pictures for sad children
13:22:00 <bonegar> a famous old webcomic that was good
13:22:04 <Selfie_Dad> piss
13:22:22 <Nude_Riker> the creator hated success and took it offline
13:22:35 <Nude_Riker> and burned some books
13:22:37 <bonegar> it seemed a lot more complicated than that, but basically yea
13:22:50 <Nude_Riker> yeah trying to simplify for format
13:23:16 <Nude_Riker> i have a complete archive even though thats against their wishes... sorry
13:23:51 <bonegar> yea people are always gonna be nasty little creeps like that...
13:24:36 <Nude_Riker> lmao gmail popin asking me to donate to ukraine

13:25:41 <bonegar> that Ned.. what's that guys name he looks really weird, the state dept guy Ned P...ned something.. did a weird press conference where they listed a bunch of stuff the US was sending, and for some reason I though one thousand hand guns was very funny

13:37:42 <Rusty> what was the chinese(?) swear word used in firefly a lot. "goram"?
13:37:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> please click
13:38:01 <bonegar> that battletech game they made was almost very cool, it's a shame it wasn't like....fully realized 
13:38:10 <Melber> God I fucking hated firefly 
13:38:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Romance AMV from Gondam Wing song Beautiful Girls by Shan Kingston
13:38:21 <bonegar> came out in like 2017 or something
13:38:25 <Melber> So many people tried to get me to like it
13:38:33 <bonegar> firefly sucks for sure
13:38:36 <bonegar> your instinct was correct
13:38:43 <Rusty> it was fine when i was like 16 but yeah i would not get thru it today
13:39:02 <bonegar> people trying to get me into whedon-anything for a long time, i feel the pain
13:39:22 <bonegar> buffy, angel (I'm sure people will say this one was OK), dollhouse, firefly
13:39:23 <scoop_jackson> i saw the firefly movie in the theatres 3 times b/c ppl kept inviting me but ive only seen a few episodes of the show
13:39:46 <bonegar> weren't there only like 12 episodes or something
13:39:50 <bonegar> and they barely even fit together
13:41:15 <bonegar> dr horrible's sing along blog
13:42:47 <Selfie_Dad> i still can ride for some of buffy and angel but i think most of those show's successes are largely in spite of whedon rather than because of him
13:42:56 <bonegar> yea
13:44:33 <Selfie_Dad> angel in particular i dont think whedon was as involved in as the other ones
13:46:18 <bonegar> sitting down to watch angel but accidentally watching 8 seasons of bones instead
13:47:04 <Selfie_Dad> *12 hours in* so when's he turn into a vampire
13:47:13 <bonegar> lol
13:47:15 <Nude_Riker> man i loved firefly
13:47:36 <bonegar> just assuming that being a sniper in the US military and becoming a cop is a metaphor for vampirism somehow
13:47:36 <Nude_Riker> when i was you know 16-18
13:49:32 <bonegar> sci fi bes like that...
13:49:59 <Selfie_Dad> lol why did it take me so long to figure out how to cheese the fight w/ this stupid knight in stormveil castle
13:50:00 -!- nine`eleven [uid403803@synIRC-EB1D7AA1.hampstead.irccloud.com] has joined #phiz
13:50:03 <bonegar> like how I liked Stargate SGU, which made people very mad with me... but i had never seen any other stargate besides the movie
13:50:09 <Selfie_Dad> kite him into the door and smack him w/ the whip thru the door
13:50:15 <nine`eleven> i saw doctor about my neck today will
13:50:23 <Rusty> .tag
13:50:24 <Selfie_Dad> and he STILL almost killed me w/ his stomp bullshit lol
13:50:41 <Selfie_Dad> whassup dan
13:50:42 <Rusty> .tag Nude_Riker browncoat
13:50:44 <bonegar> is it the guy who just runs into the elevator hole?
13:50:52 <Nude_Riker> lol
13:51:02 <Selfie_Dad> no this is like the first knight in the castle basically
13:51:10 <Selfie_Dad> guarding a room w/ a key
13:51:18 <nine`eleven> its almost certainly muscle spasm/inflammation. it's s bit weird cause i only get dull pain from it and it's not bad to touch
13:51:22 <bonegar> oh that exile knight guy
13:51:27 <bonegar> i think maybe
13:51:33 <nine`eleven> they said glands and lymphs and shit swell differently
13:51:45 <Selfie_Dad> u got whiplash?
13:51:48 <nine`eleven> so ive been given anti-inflammatory gel
13:52:06 <scoop_jackson> The biggest firefly guy I know didn’t like b5 so I can’t trust him on sci fi
13:52:10 <Selfie_Dad> did u mention karting at all
13:52:15 <nine`eleven> and i'm going in for an ultrasound as a low priority just to make sure nothing underlying is causing it
13:52:16 <bonegar> .g anti-inflammatory gel
13:52:34 <nine`eleven> she also said if it starts to go down i can cancel the ultrasound
13:52:57 <nine`eleven> she didn't seem worried tbh which is good given lumps on neck can be worrying
13:52:58 <Selfie_Dad> im just wondering if you injured some soft tissue and then minorly re-injuring it when karting or something
13:53:03 <Selfie_Dad> before it can heal all the way
13:53:14 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i guess i wouldnt worry too much about it then
13:53:30 <nine`eleven> the spot where it's swelling is exactly where my head perches after long time on computer/driving a car/etc
13:53:38 <Selfie_Dad> makes sense
13:53:44 <nine`eleven> like it's exactly where neck folds
13:53:54 <nine`eleven> when your posture gets bad at end of day
13:53:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> doo doo
13:54:22 <Selfie_Dad> when its healed you might consider some neck / rear delt / upper back strengthening and stability exercises
13:54:58 <Selfie_Dad> definitely face pulls at least if they are not already a staple of your training
13:55:16 <nine`eleven> ya
13:55:37 <nine`eleven> its literally just like the strand of the muscle is popping out and inflamed there
13:55:53 <Selfie_Dad> but also like rear delt flyes, and scapular pushups
13:55:57 <Selfie_Dad> lol
13:56:00 <nine`eleven> i will go for the scan anyway as id rather know there's no issues around there given sports i do et 
13:56:12 <Selfie_Dad> yeah worth a look just to know
13:56:15 <nine`eleven> ya
13:56:34 <Selfie_Dad> i'm guessing you have some sort of weakness in one of those smaller muscle groups and you have a compensation pattern
13:56:39 <Selfie_Dad> i've dealt with that a bunch
13:57:07 <nine`eleven> i think it flared back up cause i spent a week at my parents watching the dog and used an awful desk
13:57:20 <Selfie_Dad> prioritizing the smaller muscle groups up like the mid traps, serratus anterior, rear delts, rotator cuff
13:57:22 <nine`eleven> like I defo remember getting neck cramp that week 
13:57:32 <Selfie_Dad> yeah that shit doesnt help either
13:57:47 <nine`eleven> i did do the shoulder rotations in the gym and felt something click horrible in my neck around that spot and it's felt better since lol
13:57:49 <Selfie_Dad> i keep a resistance band at my desk just to have something to do correctional stuff while im sitting and working
13:57:58 <nine`eleven> Good idea
13:58:12 <Selfie_Dad> keeps me from getting into a bad position and staying there too long
13:59:08 <Selfie_Dad> eat more calories too you'll heal faster (i am not taking my own advice here, because i am stupid)
13:59:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> bubungus
14:00:33 <Selfie_Dad> that just reminded me i have to bring that band back up here
14:00:42 <Selfie_Dad> cause i packed it away for the weeked
14:01:01 <scoop_jackson> i didnt realize its st patricks day but im wearing green anyways
14:01:39 <Selfie_Dad> i forgot until we got to day care and they had pasted leprechaun foot prints all over the place
14:03:09 <Selfie_Dad> i dont like that theyre trying to make st patty's day an elf on the shelf type thing
14:03:21 <scoop_jackson> i hope grandpa McCleery is proud of me for wearing green

14:06:28 <bonegar> good to know not to go out today
14:06:49 <Selfie_Dad> its cause they always find a reason to celebrate it on both weekends bookending the day itself lol
14:07:03 <bonegar> very true
14:11:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i haven't received the elden ring patch yet
14:12:36 <Selfie_Dad> welp ive gotten to the other knight

14:13:35 <Rusty> Maelcum a rude boy
14:13:40 <Selfie_Dad> lol
14:15:08 <Rusty> github down lol
14:15:31 <Rusty> FU Bill Gate$$$
14:16:21 <Selfie_Dad> check out how awesome our healthcare system is
14:16:33 <Selfie_Dad> that im working on these issues
14:16:55 <Selfie_Dad> Ok, so the meds I think should be the main red flags for any cardiac problem are:  Eliquis (apixaban), Xarelto (rivaroxaban), Brilinta (ticagrelor), Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan), and Lovenox (enoxaparin).  Many times, especially with Eliquis, the insurance just wants to know if this is for A-Fib or DVT … ok approved, done.  There could also be an affordability issue for our Medicare patients.  But Eliquis, Xarelto, 
14:16:56 <Selfie_Dad> Brilinta, and Entresto each have a Free 30 day trial card available for anybody … ONCE PER LIFETIME USE ONLY.  If I know there is an problem, I can complete and submit the prior auth or send it to the cardiac office to complete or change.  Either way, the patient will be covered for the month while it is figured out.  
14:16:56 <Selfie_Dad> Enoxaparin is different because it is generic and many times the issue is there is a quantity limit.  We have used GoodRx cards to help with cost if insurance will not pay, but that is the only med I have had a problem with a different higher price coming up at the pharmacy when the patient goes to pick up.  
14:17:01 <Selfie_Dad> For COPD meds, it is usually a formulary versus non-formulary issue, and hopefully the providers will utilize the handy green preferred and red non-preferred boxes Lauren mentioned.  If the insurance is not available in Cerner, I can call and check the formulary before an inhaler is prescribed or the provider can send a script ahead of time to the patient’s pharmacy and we can check coverage and make adjustments if needed 
14:17:06 <Selfie_Dad> before the patient is discharged.  
14:17:07 <Selfie_Dad> The other issue is that we have discharged Medicare patients on 2 or 3 inhalers and they cannot afford all of that.  Many of these patients have a $480 deductible first, then $47 per inhaler per month copay, then fall into the “donut hole” mid-year or earlier due to these prices, and then have to pay 25% of a $400 inhaler.  So Rose and myself started to push for the providers to prescribe 1 inhaler if needed and add the 
14:17:13 <Selfie_Dad> more affordable nebulizers since they are generic and billed through Medicare Part B (not through the prescription plan).  And this is where there was a hold up because the pharmacies needed the ICD-10 code to be able to properly bill Medicare.  
14:18:04 <Selfie_Dad> these are all things the average health care consumer should keep in mind while shopping the marketplace of health insurance
14:19:15 <mikev> time for scoop_jackson  to make some money
14:19:18 <mikev> https://twitter.com/apmassaro3/status/1504229580437131270

14:30:10 <Rusty> schmitts gay ftw
14:30:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> my scale has finally arrived
14:30:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> i now know what i weigh and it is: exactly what i estimated i weighed at the start of this, meaning i was fatter than i thought i was
14:31:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> that or i havent actually lost any weight which seems unlikely
14:31:57 <Nude_Riker> how long have you been dieting?
14:33:23 <Selfie_Dad> you almost certainly have shed some water weight and a bit of fat
14:33:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> if i answer that question youre probably going to say something like "it actually seems very likely that you haven't lost any weight in that amount of time"
14:33:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> despite the fact that i am certain that i have because there has been a visible change
14:33:58 <Selfie_Dad> actually when you start a caloric deficit in the first week you probably lose more than any other time
14:34:17 <Selfie_Dad> because you shed water weight as well as stored glycogen and small amount of fat
14:34:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> i was talking to matt but yeah probably idk
14:34:31 <Nude_Riker> yeah usually people get frustrated when that doesnt continue at the same rate
14:34:35 <Selfie_Dad> i know you were talking to matt but ill head it off at the pass
14:34:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think ive had that much opportunity to shed water weight as i havent exercised at all but i plan on starting to do that now that we got nice stationary bike
14:35:08 <Nude_Riker> im glad tom has a matt construct in his head to provide whatever he thinks i would say
14:35:14 <Selfie_Dad> u dont shed water weight by exercising  generally 
14:35:25 <Selfie_Dad> i mean you will lose some but you;ll pick it back up
14:35:32 <Selfie_Dad> theres a lot that goes into water retention
14:35:42 <Selfie_Dad> like the kinds of foods you eat, stress levels, sleep, etc
14:37:02 <Selfie_Dad> the one good thing about macrofactor is it gives you a broader picture of the trend so even if the day to day fluctuates you will know you are losing weight and at what rate, so it can align w/ your goal rate of loss 
14:37:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> well at least i have a scale now so i know what i weigh
14:37:37 <Nude_Riker> .gis my neck hurts
14:37:47 <Nude_Riker> 0 to 60
14:38:01 <Selfie_Dad> and for consistency's sake i recommend you weigh yourself in the AM every day when you've gotten up and pissed w/o clothes 
14:38:15 <Selfie_Dad> and before you like eat or drink anything
14:38:18 <Nude_Riker> pissed and shitted
14:38:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> well thats what i did today so i will continue that
14:38:33 <Selfie_Dad> well shitting is nice too but not required
14:38:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> i generally dont shit until ive been up for a couple hours
14:38:45 <Selfie_Dad> usually shitting doesnt happen til u've eaten and drank something
14:38:48 <Selfie_Dad> so its a wash
14:39:01 <Nude_Riker> i shit pretty much right after getting up it rocks
14:39:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> if i started drinking c*ffee again i would shit earlier
14:39:13 <bonegar> you could weigh yourself, poop, weigh yourself again and figure out how much your poop weighed
14:39:13 <Selfie_Dad> i gotta have a lil coffee at least
14:39:15 <Nude_Riker> thank you magnesium
14:39:19 <Selfie_Dad> or addy+water
14:39:23 <Nude_Riker> and adderall
14:39:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> after i weighed myself this morning i weighed myself holding mango
14:39:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> now i know what mango weighs
14:39:50 <Nude_Riker> :)
14:39:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> he is 11 lbs of cat
14:40:01 <Selfie_Dad> is it a digital scale or an analogue one
14:40:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> analog
14:40:10 <Selfie_Dad> cool nice
14:40:31 <het> I weighed in at 260 for the first time today
14:40:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> also; the fedex tracking says it still hasnt even gotten to new york so uh... i might be getting another one
14:40:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> nice
14:40:38 <het> on the subject of weight and scales
14:41:04 <Selfie_Dad> nice het'
14:41:13 <Selfie_Dad> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/bUHX94Yu/1647528070.PNG
14:41:20 <Selfie_Dad> this screen is the money right here
14:41:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> i am at 210 which is the highest weight ive ever weighed myself at but i was certainly like... 215 at least when i started
14:42:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> my goal weight is 170 which is like just under the threshhold of overweight at my height, but i am Stoutly Built so i will always weigh a bit more than 'recommended' for my height regardless of actual fitness
14:42:49 <Selfie_Dad> bmi is stupid anyway
14:42:54 <bonegar> yeah, it's trash
14:43:21 <Selfie_Dad> at like 180 i teeter on the edge of overweight according to bmi
14:43:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> i agree
14:43:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> bad measurement index
14:43:49 <bonegar> the healthy-at-any-size stuff that people make fun of i think was initially to counter-act bad BMI brain
14:43:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean i was medically obese acording to bmi scale when i got my vax (hence being able to get it early)
14:44:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i was healthy
14:44:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> as confirmed by an actual doctor
14:44:08 <Selfie_Dad> and i've been 180 lbs in many different configurations 
14:44:21 <Selfie_Dad> w/ varying degrees of fat free mass
14:44:31 <Selfie_Dad> but bmi doesnt care
14:44:44 <Nude_Riker> bmi < bmw
14:45:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> according to bmi scale at my height i should be 130-170 but i was 140 once and people were Concerned about me because my ribs were showing
14:45:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> so yeah
14:45:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> doesnt mean much i dont think
14:45:25 <bonegar> you can always see a lil rib i think at certain weights
14:45:30 <Selfie_Dad> ribs showing isnt a problem
14:45:33 <bonegar> yea
14:45:40 <Nude_Riker> if you can see behind the ribs, problem
14:45:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> you could see like, most of my ribs. i was not healthy at that time
14:45:45 <Selfie_Dad> people have a weird complex about the ribs
14:45:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> i can assure you of this
14:45:51 <Rusty> has anyone said ascap yet
14:45:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> sesac
14:46:02 <bonegar> rib thing
14:46:32 <Nude_Riker> if you can see behind the ribs, there isnt any skin or flesh, and you are a skeleton, you are an animated skeleton and this is a ghost story
14:46:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> [john lydon voice] bmi
14:46:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l
14:47:03 <Selfie_Dad> theres a big difference between being able to see ribs and being like emaciated
14:47:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> you listen to this one yet Selfie_Dad 
14:47:16 <Selfie_Dad> nope
14:47:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> its really good
14:47:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think the mare cognitum guy did some stuff on it
14:47:45 <Nude_Riker> im on a seeribs diet, i see ribs and i eat em
14:47:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> and put it out through his label
14:47:58 <Selfie_Dad> mr spriggs bbq

14:48:28 <bonegar> yeah, even more now
14:48:31 <Selfie_Dad> brisket has such a high ceiling but it can be so dissapointing if its not good

14:49:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> my chief keef record was supposed to get here today but it doesnt look like it will now
14:49:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> fuckers
14:49:49 <Nude_Riker> it was good
14:50:06 <Selfie_Dad> .l
14:50:08 <bonegar> bbq shouldn't be expensive, or brisket tho imo
14:50:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> i want to hear laughing to the bank on vinyl god dammit
14:50:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> .seen HAW_HAW_HAW
14:50:20 <Selfie_Dad> haw haw haw
14:50:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> ^
14:50:33 <Selfie_Dad> bbq is very expensive most places
14:50:53 <Selfie_Dad> except for like pulled pork and pulled chicken
14:50:56 <bonegar> yeah, it's been a huge trend for awhile
14:52:10 <Nude_Riker> $19 for the plate of 2 meats and 2 sides
14:52:17 <bonegar> i was gonna maybe walk to the movie theater and see the batman movie just to try to do a thing but it looks like it's gonna rain
14:52:23 <Selfie_Dad> that doesnt sound too bad rly
14:52:28 <Selfie_Dad> how big were the portions
14:52:35 <Nude_Riker> not huge
14:52:52 <het> yeah 19$ for a two meat platter isn't horrible
14:52:54 <Selfie_Dad> i guess
14:52:56 <scoop_jackson> i was under the impression you liked the rain
14:52:57 <Selfie_Dad> ive seen worse
14:53:06 <Nude_Riker> one Scoop of pork and 2 thin strips of brisket, little cups of the sides and a piece of cornbread
14:53:10 <Nude_Riker> not terrible
14:53:11 <Selfie_Dad> living in a place where a sandwich can easily cost you that much
14:53:14 <bonegar> i dont like walking in it
14:53:34 <Nude_Riker> but you know, none of the food was particularly great
14:53:37 <bonegar> i wouldnt really want to walk to a movie and get wet and sit there for 3 hours wet
14:53:39 <Nude_Riker> its all fine
14:53:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> i thought fine actually meant bad
14:53:49 <bonegar> regardless of how i feel about rain, it's not condusive to the activity i wish to do
14:53:58 <Selfie_Dad> most food is fine
14:54:01 <Nude_Riker> no, fine doesnt mean good
14:54:04 <Nude_Riker> bad is bad
14:54:20 <het> https://twitter.com/AdamLefkoe/status/1504467617381330945/photo/1
14:54:28 <Nude_Riker> generally speaking i do not want fine, i want good
14:54:28 <Selfie_Dad> lmao
14:54:28 <bonegar> lots of bad bbq out there
14:54:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
14:54:39 <scoop_jackson> ive never had an exceptional bbq experience
14:54:56 <Nude_Riker> so for $19 it is fine, average, but not something i would ever go out of my way for or choose in lieu of something else
14:55:07 <Selfie_Dad> i'm fine w/ fine
14:55:07 <bonegar> best bbq experiences ive had were not at restaurants
14:55:42 <bonegar> a lot more satisfying, i think, to make a day of it with some friends
14:55:54 <Nude_Riker> the best bbq i imagine probably comes from a Shack
14:56:32 <Nude_Riker> but also i have never had barbeque i thought was amazing either, im just imagining
14:56:32 <bonegar> a shack. a heart. a beast.
14:56:34 <bonegar> these things
14:56:45 <Nude_Riker> i know it exists, somewhere
14:57:35 <Selfie_Dad> u can really gas urself up about how good the bbq is if u waited in a line for 4 hrs to eat it
14:57:43 <Nude_Riker> lol
14:57:52 <Nude_Riker> i wouldnt wait 4 hours in line to eat anything
14:57:52 <bonegar> i had very good bbq camping once, and we did the red vinegar sauce
14:58:14 <Nude_Riker> i mean, unless i had to do that to eat, period
14:58:19 <bonegar> but i think a lot of it was just having a nice day camping and then drinking a lot and then eating the food when you've been waiting until a nice summer dusk
14:58:49 <Nude_Riker> yeah, the best seasoning is hunger and a nice outside day

15:32:28 <mikev> i still wait for Saturday
15:32:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> 11:24 AM <mikev> is the implication that he shot some random black guy for encroaching on punjabi territory
15:32:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> i believe the implication is simply that there is a place among some shipping crates that is reserved for punjabi n---as only
15:32:53 <Nude_Riker> i like that a lot of the comments appear to be just about the original not this remix
15:32:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> and the black guy there is disappointed that he cant enter

15:52:15 <mikev> last time i saw him i went to his place and he just spent like an hour and a half straight manically showing me all his swg stuff, couldn't get a word in edgewise 
15:52:15 <mikev> including pets that he had made with 0 HAM (health action and mind)
15:52:15 <mikev> + he was telling me all about his conflicts with the people who run the server
15:52:15 <mikev> they're all imperials and he's very into being a rebel, he projects a lot onto that conflict in a way where its unclear where the RP stops and starts
15:52:15 <mikev> he also does things like taking off his helmet and dismissing his pets to enter the cantina

17:02:33 <Selfie_Dad> but, w/e

17:05:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> well they already released 400 degreez and barter 6 a while ago
17:06:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> but they've been OOP and sold out for a long time

17:07:25 <Selfie_Dad> justice is exactly the kind of record i expect from them
17:07:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> at like... 70 dollars
17:07:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/qN359Q4T/image.png
17:08:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> never especially cared about low end theory tbh
17:08:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> before my time
17:08:22 <Selfie_Dad> i like it but its not one i return to a ton
17:08:37 <Selfie_Dad> well tbf so is too hard to swallow
17:08:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah i guess so
17:08:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> but ugk is much more my shit
17:08:56 <Selfie_Dad> that record came out the same year as my first rap cd
17:09:00 <Selfie_Dad> which was kriss kross
17:09:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> the first thing i ever got from vmp which convinced me it had some degree of utility as a website was ridin dirty
17:09:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
17:09:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> did you wear your clothes backwards to school
17:09:20 <eric> lol
17:09:28 <mpg> lol
17:09:36 <eric> i had a pair of pants with back pockets on the front iirc
17:09:38 <eric> they were cords
17:09:44 <mpg> my first rap cassette was NWA
17:09:47 <eric> so not really like kirss kross
17:09:51 <mpg> it felt so dangerous at the time
17:10:09 <mikev> badass
17:10:10 <mikev> https://scontent.feau1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/275995573_496799655373460_7607833286253106333_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8bfeb9&_nc_ohc=FbnPS-YvkEMAX85YJq_&_nc_ht=scontent.feau1-1.fna&oh=00_AT-BlU_e_a8f5QUKa4SHNmmujwlg550uk3Iny70rewDsDw&oe=62383DF2
17:10:19 <eric> SHAT]
17:11:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have no idea what the first rap thing i actually owned was, i was very anti-rap for most of my childhood but my dad had some rap stuff (ie public enemy, beastie boys)
17:11:30 <Selfie_Dad> i did wear my clothes backwards
17:11:48 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i think the next rap thing i got was ill communication
17:11:48 <eric> i think the first rap thing i liked was Da Chronic 2001
17:11:55 <eric> or mayub e the og
17:12:11 <Melber> my first rap thing i owned was definitely like the sounds of science box set or something
17:12:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think i was already into my music piracy phase by the time i started liking rap
17:12:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> so the first thing i bought was probably a record actually
17:12:35 <eric> the first rap thing i liked was
17:12:35 <Selfie_Dad> then i was off rap for a while until the first dmx record came out
17:12:40 <eric> .y got rice
17:12:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i think my first rap record was uh, busta rhymes ELE
17:12:44 <Melber> and then later either deltron 3030 or like a handsome boy modeling school album
17:12:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> which i was very disappointed to find out was censored
17:13:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> thereby making it unlistenable
17:13:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
17:13:05 <Selfie_Dad> and i had a bunch of ruff ryders stuff, all the roots cds, etc
17:13:28 <Melber> lol i remember my buddy in like 6th grade getting all of the biggie and puff daddy albums but having to get them at wal mart
17:13:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> im trying to think if i actually bought any hip hop stuff when i was a kid buying cds but i dont think i did, i just listened to some of the stuff my dad would get 
17:13:41 <Selfie_Dad> once i got back into rap the first records i got were dmx its dark and hell is hot, ruff ryders vol 1, and dj clue - the professional
17:13:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> mostly stuff that i added to my own collection was stuff that i knew my dad didnt care about
17:13:54 <Selfie_Dad> and probably busta rhymes the coming
17:14:02 <mpg> i had beastie boys - check ya head
17:14:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think i still have that censored busta rhymes record
17:14:08 <mpg> that was cool at the time
17:14:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> i really should have looked closer at the label on that one
17:14:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
17:14:27 <bonegar> rap, like R rated movies and Dungeons and Dragons was extremely banned
17:14:29 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i had check your head too
17:14:30 <Selfie_Dad> it was good
17:14:41 <Selfie_Dad> it has some heat still
17:14:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> i liked listening to beastie boys before most other rap (guess why) but my dad had all those cds
17:15:11 <mpg> lol i got in trouble listening to so whatch want at school because my dumb fuck teacher thought he said the N word and would not believe me when i said he did not
17:15:14 <bonegar> the famous children's rap group the beastie boys
17:15:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
17:15:28 <Melber> sabotage is a pretty good way to get into hip hop if like punk rock is your shit
17:15:32 <Selfie_Dad> because they actually played their instruments unlike tthose OTHER rap groups
17:15:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://c.tenor.com/l_8On9aC5AoAAAAC/thats-bait-no-text.gif
17:15:40 <mpg> lol Selfie_Dad
17:15:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> this is all code words for They Are White
17:15:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> i am not Afraid of them
17:16:07 <Selfie_Dad> its funny how big beasties got considering like all their early stuff are just novelty songs
17:16:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> people love novelty songs
17:16:16 <Selfie_Dad> i guess novelty songs had a fair amount of traction in the 80s
17:16:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean you could say stuff like ll cool j my radio was more or less a novelty
17:16:30 <mpg> are you sayin brass monkey is a novelty song
17:16:35 <Melber> also rap was very much considered a novelty
17:16:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> run dmc's biggest early crossover stuff is pretyt novelty
17:16:40 <eric> my soft take is that the beastie boys are good actually
17:16:44 <Melber> by white folks
17:16:45 <eric> though i wouldnt really listen to them now
17:16:45 <mpg> NWA was not a novelty i dont think
17:16:51 <mpg> it was Bad
17:16:58 <bonegar> im not in on the beastie boys unfortunately
17:17:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> a lot of early (im talking early 80s) rap that is considered foundational was absolutely novelty stuff
17:17:04 <mpg> NWA and Slayer
17:17:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> like kurtis blow
17:17:10 <Melber> well NWA was a menace 
17:17:18 <Rusty> .y super wolf can do it long version
17:17:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> .y RAP-O CLAP-O

17:17:55 <eric> those rap guuys are always up to a bit of fun
17:18:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> rappers delight is a bigtime novelty
17:18:07 <mpg> haha rappin and break dancin
17:18:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> actually i remember watching some documentary thing
17:18:21 <Melber> The title track is a rap-influenced novelty song co-written by J.B. Moore and Robert Ford Jr.; the same songwriters who worked with Kurtis Blow on "The Breaks".
17:18:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> where like ice cube or someone was talking about the message by grandmaster flash
17:18:29 <bonegar> not sure when rap becomes hip hop in the novelty movement
17:18:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> and he was like 'man everyone in the hood HATED that song'
17:18:45 <mpg> it's a pretty funny song
17:18:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> 'we wanted to party and these dudes were talkin about serious shit'
17:18:50 <mpg> but the synth sound is cool as hell
17:19:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> it was rejected specifically because it was not a novelty song
17:19:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
17:19:18 <mpg> Homie_in_a_geod: the birth of conscious hip hop
17:19:18 <Melber> my copy paste is about rappin rodney
17:19:27 <Rusty> .y boogie in your butt
17:19:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> what about unconscious hip hop
17:19:35 <Selfie_Dad> .y jam on it
17:19:39 <Selfie_Dad> ^
17:19:47 <mpg> jam on it was break dance music
17:19:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/lhULONKX/image.png
17:20:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah no thanks
17:20:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l
17:20:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> this is a good record
17:20:41 <Melber> "do you promise i can ask you anything?" "yes" "HOW COME BLACK PEOPLE GET TO SAY-"
17:20:45 <Selfie_Dad> I SUCK THE DEVILS COCK
17:21:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> Melber: i have mentioned this in here before but a white guy actually asked that in my black studies class in college
17:21:23 <mpg> lol
17:21:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> or well, he attempted to ask it
17:21:30 <mpg> i vaguely remember this story tom
17:21:44 <mpg> wasn't he acting like a big jerk off or something leading up to that
17:21:57 <scoop_jackson> the truth is people were cutting breaks in long island contemporaneously with kool herc in the bronx
17:21:59 <mpg> might have my wires crossed
17:22:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> well he had already said something about how 9/11 was an inside job
17:22:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> the class before that
17:22:06 <mpg> lol
17:22:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
17:22:08 <Selfie_Dad> lol
17:22:09 <mpg> hahaha
17:22:11 <Selfie_Dad> cool guys
17:22:17 <mpg> dude is a hitter
17:22:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> i forget how it came up but he was talking about something else and he was like "and because of that I don't understand why only black people should be allowed to say th-" and the professor cut him off and was like
17:22:46 <Melber> lmaooooo
17:22:50 <Selfie_Dad> after 4 sets of 10 deadlifts im considering a nap
17:23:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> "ok listen. i'm going to let you think about this for 5 minutes, and if you still want to ask that question then you can and we'll talk about it. but i want you to look around [note: about 3/4 of the class was black] and really think about this."
17:23:41 <Rusty> lol
17:23:42 <Selfie_Dad> lmao
17:23:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> he did not end up asking the question again
17:23:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> and he never came back to the class after that day
17:23:53 <eric> being in calss was fucking annoying
17:23:53 <mpg> haha that was it
17:24:01 <mpg> the ending was "and he was never seen again"
17:24:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> it was so good
17:24:10 <mpg> he could be wondering about that question to this very day
17:24:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think he got his answer
17:24:27 <Melber> i imagine somewhere in his final paper there' "and in conclusion, while I agree I shouldn't say it with a hard R, I think if I say it LIKE BLACK PEOPLE SAY IT"
17:24:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
17:24:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> that class was so good
17:25:00 <Melber> i know ive told you guys about the dude in my math class in college who didn't come to a single lecture
17:25:28 <Melber> and the professor was like "well, you said you did all the homework, so if you can pass the exam, ill give you a passing grade"
17:25:41 <Selfie_Dad> .l
17:25:47 <Selfie_Dad> this record is an absolute ripper
17:26:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> apparently i have queued that one already
17:26:14 <Melber> he's the first one finished with the exam and the professor pulled him aside and was like "just from looking at this i can tell you have no idea what's going on, but if you turn in the homework and you actually did it all, i'll give you a C-"
17:26:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> im still not out of december in 2021 records yet
17:26:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
17:26:35 <Melber> and dude was like "oh okay it's in my car," then proceeded to pull a complete and total simpsons, and hop in his car and drive away
17:26:43 <Rusty> lol
17:26:45 <Melber> which was especially funny because his car was parked RIGHT outside the classroom

17:52:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no windows no nothing
17:53:02 <Pervo_Terdvonnen> thats why that cougar mess is kinda hot

17:53:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> nice pile
17:53:42 <eric> except the scanner under the sheet
17:55:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> fucking christ
17:56:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> i just tried to ride the stationary bike and i got literally 2 mins into the workout and had to stop
17:56:19 <eric> you gotta fuck the bike slow
17:56:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> i cant get even close to the pace they want you to do, and i also cant sit on the fucking bike seat
17:56:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> the seat is rock fucking hard
17:57:06 <eric> yeah
17:57:13 <eric> ur gooch gets used to it 
17:57:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> not particularly interested in whatever sort of fucking torture i have to go through in order to get past the acclimation portion of that
17:57:40 <eric> up to you
17:58:06 <eric> u can get a seat cover for it probably
17:58:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> its not like ive never rode a stationary bike or a bike in general before, ive just never sat on a bikeseat that fucking painful
17:58:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think that I am the problem here
17:58:41 <Selfie_Dad> is it one of those ones that you have to peddle to turn on
17:58:46 <eric> didnt mean to imply that
17:59:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk what you mean by that Selfie_Dad 
17:59:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> like it turns on automatically when you start pedaling yes
17:59:17 <Selfie_Dad> yeah like its powered by the pedalling
17:59:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh
17:59:22 <Selfie_Dad> not some outside source
17:59:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah idk i guess so
17:59:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> dont think that especially matters here though
17:59:37 <Selfie_Dad> we have those in the neighborhood gym
17:59:38 <Selfie_Dad> i dont love em
17:59:56 <Selfie_Dad> i was just wondering why you had to do a certain pace
18:00:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> sydney has the peloton app and i was going to try to do one of the workouts on the app
18:00:11 <Selfie_Dad> cause those yeah you have to pedal at like a certain minimum speed or they just turn off
18:00:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> and they tell you what cadence you should be going, and the ipad tracks how fast you are pedaling when its resting on the stand thing on the bike
18:00:34 <Selfie_Dad> i wouldnt bother jumping into that sort of thing if uve not used the bike before
18:00:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> it wasnt go a certain speed or the bike turns off 
18:00:53 <Selfie_Dad> i think just getting on the thing and moving for a short amount of time is the goal u wanna set
18:00:59 <Selfie_Dad> but the seat complicates things yeah
18:01:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> its a moot point if i cant sit on it yeah
18:01:07 <Selfie_Dad> some of those things are awful

18:03:25 <Selfie_Dad> is the seat adjustable at all
18:03:27 <Selfie_Dad> like angle or w/e
18:03:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> only height as far as i can tell
18:04:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> its also way too high, idk how the fuck sydney uses it at the height that its at but i guess a lot of people ride their bikes with their seats really high
18:04:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> i cant ride a bike if the seat is so high that i cant touch the ground with my feet at all
18:05:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> i ordered the "extra comfort" bike seat
18:05:25 <Selfie_Dad> yeah im sure you get used to that but its a very offputting feeling to me

19:27:20 <bonegar> got inquisitor ghiza... i dont think i want to join this volcano cult
19:27:25 <bonegar> i dunno why they want to kill this tree
19:27:50 <Selfie_Dad> i found a hack to listen to a youtube on phone w/ screen off w/o subbing to youtube premium or w/e
19:28:06 <eric> theres some app my friend showed mme for that
19:28:11 <bonegar> whats the trick?
19:28:36 <Selfie_Dad> i installed the adblock plugin for safari (which blocks stuff in chrome too)
19:28:49 <eric> https://newpipe.net/
19:29:00 <Selfie_Dad> and then while i watch the video i just swipe down to the control center, pause the video, and then turn screen off
19:29:07 <eric> u need to use fdroid for it though
19:29:10 <Selfie_Dad> and it shows as now playing on lock screen to unpause after that
19:29:11 <eric> nice
19:29:20 <Selfie_Dad> yeah my trick is specific to ios i guess i should say
19:29:24 <bonegar> oh that makes sense 
19:29:25 <bonegar> yea
19:29:41 <bonegar> i have ios, ive done that a lot
19:29:47 <bonegar> mostly through carplay
19:30:14 <eric> garplay
19:30:15 <Selfie_Dad> yeah it doesnt work w/ the yt app but if you just goto the mobile site it works
19:30:56 <bonegar> yea i never used the yt app, but i think it does some mobile thing where it behaves like an app, i guess the adblock guys did some wizard stuff
19:31:30 <eric> i noticed recently that firefox has stopped allowing me to view the simple version of nyt recipes
19:31:40 <Selfie_Dad> i think the site can tell the mobile browser whether to allow video w/ screen off or not
19:31:52 <Selfie_Dad> just like it can tell the browser whether picture in picture is allowed
19:32:03 <Selfie_Dad> but the adblock extension seems to fix the first one at least
19:32:04 <eric> bad browsers win again
19:33:12 <bonegar> da struggle
19:33:16 <bonegar> back to bbs
19:37:32 <Nude_Riker> oh wow youtube shut down the thing i used for youtube, guess i can never upgrade

19:51:11 <eric> wierd
19:51:13 <dreddybajs> thats how i got in and i never found out if theres another way lol
19:51:17 <eric> i found the one that teleports you there

19:53:12 <Nude_Riker> need my guts to calm down before this interview, stupid barbeque yesterday
19:53:18 <dreddybajs> it doesnt commit you to anything fwiw bonegar 
19:53:32 <bonegar> Ranni was like... yea anything babe np... 
19:53:43 <dreddybajs> ranni ftw
19:53:47 <bonegar> for you ranni? *doing the justin beiber neck flex thing* ha ha
19:53:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> weed crapp
19:54:07 <Nude_Riker> cats are begging for dinner early, might feed them so they dont bother me in this
19:54:12 <Nude_Riker> bad precedent
19:55:34 <dreddybajs> oh actually bonegar i cant remember if you can get into the dungeon or not without joining the manor
19:55:44 <dreddybajs> but you can join and then not do any of their side missions
19:55:47 <bonegar> no idea what you are talking about
19:56:47 <dreddybajs> oh i thought you were talking about volcano manor
19:57:01 <bonegar> that's where i am, yes
19:57:30 <dreddybajs> yeah one of the ways to progress the area is to join, i cant remember if theres another way forward
19:57:41 <dreddybajs> and its a boss you cant skip i dont think
19:58:02 <bonegar> guess i'll find out
19:58:49 <Selfie_Dad> gonna order a pizza for my family
19:58:57 <Selfie_Dad> daddys not cookin tonight
19:58:59 <dreddybajs> nice
20:03:47 <dreddybajs> paddys day traffic has fallen off a bit https://www.earthcam.com/world/ireland/dublin/?cam=templebar
20:04:06 <HellaBrad> yeah you dont have to go into the volcano manor through the house, i did the entire area backwards
20:04:36 <HellaBrad> if you let the abductor in the basement of raya lucaria eat you you wake up inside the manor area in the monster zone
20:04:39 <dreddybajs> ah nice HellaBrad 
20:04:50 <dreddybajs> oh i did that but i couldnt figure out how to get out of that part into the main area
20:05:11 <HellaBrad> theres a section of wall you can drop off of right above the magma wyrms den
20:05:23 <HellaBrad> you land in the lava and then can roll to safety
20:05:52 <dreddybajs> cool
20:09:41 <HellaBrad> yeah it was funny because when i finally made it to the house there was absolutely nothing to do there, like i just didnt know about the area behind the godskin noble's church, it would have been funny if i finished that entire zone without ever meeting the volcano cult
20:14:46 <eric> i got in
20:14:51 <eric> and found the grace
20:14:53 <dreddybajs> nice
20:14:56 <eric> sneak style
20:14:59 <dreddybajs> did you have to teleport or is there another way 
20:15:02 <dreddybajs> cool
20:15:28 <eric> you can go around back yeah go up to the main gate where you get ambushed and just follow the cliffs anti clockwise
20:15:32 -!- NORG [~NORG@synIRC-E2E297F7.tx.res.rr.com] has joined #phiz

20:19:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hey NORG how was work
20:20:32 <alansmithee_> also dreddybajs apparently my katana did get nerfed :(. damage is same but does way less stagger
20:20:35 <alansmithee_> which i was noticing
20:20:44 <Horny_Kissinger> remember all the times andre nickatina rapped over leprechaun beats https://youtu.be/4new8mJQH0A
20:21:43 <dreddybajs> ah damn, i think they rebalanced a lot of shit yeah
20:22:06 <alansmithee_> which i wish they would've put that in the patch notes, i know i ate some deaths cause of it
20:22:18 <alansmithee_> i'd be spamming slash like "why isn't this dude getting stunned!"
20:22:47 <alansmithee_> tbh i may just try to do a str or str/faith build. i love stunning shit
20:23:57 <eric> too bad theres not a methodmane castle

20:29:32 <NORG> me too
20:29:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> pemp
20:32:03 <dreddybajs> i think str int might be the way to go alansmithee_ so you can use dark moon greatsword and stuff like that maybe
20:32:23 <bonegar> i basically have wanted to immediately murder every NPC in this game, and i will do this on my second run
20:32:28 <bonegar> except for two 
20:33:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think i've decided on str int
20:33:22 <bonegar> str int ftw
20:33:25 <bonegar> wizard knight

20:37:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've always sold them
20:37:43 <bonegar> i always popped em cuz that's how you do in dark souls
20:37:51 <bonegar> dont even think you could sell as an option

20:45:37 <bonegar> https://i.imgur.com/tasbH9C.png
20:45:46 <alansmithee_> mpg damage is same but does less stagger on the L2
20:45:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> there is a record i really want that has never been pressed on vinyl before but it is only for sale in taiwan and you can only order it to pick up at a convenience store
20:45:58 <mpg> alansmithee_: oh is that it?

20:47:30 <bonegar> https://i.imgur.com/LXNYrxe.png this is the one i like using, with the holy weapon bless
20:47:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/Zvz7x6jh/image.png

20:48:24 <mpg> yeah my mimic practically took out the dragon on the moonlight plateau solo
20:48:25 <ajj> jericho ftmfw
20:48:33 <mpg> it was a real treat to watch from afar
20:48:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i was excited to use a mimic for htat reason
20:49:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah it was funny ajj
20:49:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> less funny was watching jeff hardy look like shit
20:49:26 <ajj> lol
20:49:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> it feels to me like people should not be encouraging him to wrestle at this time
20:50:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> he was like centimeters from landing on his head and killing himself on the swanton bomb
20:50:28 <ajj> yeah
20:52:22 <mpg> thinkin about the movie, the wrestler
20:53:02 <ajj> the wrestler movie ftw
20:53:23 <ajj> tehy were supposed to do a chris jericho v mickey rourke tie in feud with wwe but it fell through 
20:53:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> mpg at first i parsed that wrong and thought you meant that there was a wrestler named The Movie
20:53:31 <ajj> rofl
20:53:34 <mpg> lmao
20:53:44 <mpg> how has there never been a wrestler called the movie
20:53:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats a good idea
20:53:49 <mpg> what a good gimmick that would be
20:53:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats kind of the miz's gimmick
20:54:01 <ajj> The Movie, tag team partner of The Whole F'en Show 
20:54:06 <mpg> coming out to the ring eating popcorn
20:54:24 <mpg> does the stone cold beer chug, except he dumps popcorn in his face
20:54:27 <ajj> the miz gimmick where he had his stunt double come out for him was epic 
20:55:01 <mpg> mickey rourke was like the best casting for the wrestler
20:55:05 <mpg> he's perfect
20:55:15 <mpg> leathery old muscle dude
20:56:56 <alansmithee_> Homie_in_a_geod: it was golddust's gimmick to start
20:58:02 <alansmithee_> also that promo is funny as heck
20:59:01 <mpg> Homie_in_a_geod: good pic of you and sydney chugging

21:02:53 <alansmithee_> lol i missed that fight entirely 
21:03:01 <mpg> you can go back and do it still i think
21:03:07 <mpg> i did it long after i beat radahn
21:03:12 <alansmithee_> i don't think so, at least after what i read
21:03:21 <alansmithee_> there's an npc that goes there and kills everything
21:03:26 <mpg> oh damn
21:04:46 <alansmithee_> yeah i missed a bunch of stuff in there lol
21:06:34 <mpg> i was worred i missed a bunch of npc quests after doing a major plot changing thing but apparantly there are a bunch that you can finish any time
21:06:39 <mpg> i saw a big chart about it
21:06:44 <ajj> yeah
21:06:58 <ajj> also until like 2 days ago there were like 3/4 npc quests that were just straight up broken
21:06:58 <NORG> WTF this shit is directed by ben stiller?

21:29:40 <dreddybajs> although damn yes that guy looks bad
21:30:27 <Selfie_Dad> ihave consumed my pizza..
21:30:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> he does not look cool.
21:32:05 <dreddybajs> what was on the 'za Selfie_Dad 
21:32:17 <Selfie_Dad> pep
21:34:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i want pizza
21:34:47 <dreddybajs> pep ftw
21:34:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'll eat a salad instead though
21:35:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have to wait.... 2 more weeks until i can eat pizza again
21:35:06 <Selfie_Dad> good idea
21:35:11 <HellaBrad> ive been making a lot of my own pizza dough lately
21:35:23 <Selfie_Dad> pizza tastes good but completely unsatisfying unfortunately
21:35:34 <Selfie_Dad> unless you eat 1700 calories worth
21:35:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i have the same experience
21:35:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm hungry too soon after i eat carbs
21:35:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> veggies keep me fuller longer
21:36:08 <Selfie_Dad> and then u have had a huge bolus of fat and salt
21:36:12 <Selfie_Dad> no good for tummy
21:36:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ya
21:36:25 <HellaBrad> i try to think of it as like a flatbread side and have it with some veggies
21:36:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't really like eating pizza unless it's got a bunch of veggies on it
21:36:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> NOT broccoli
21:36:58 <dreddybajs> i like spinach on the za
21:36:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> mushrooms and spinach and olives
21:37:01 <HellaBrad> broccoli is nuts
21:37:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> broccoli on pizza is psycho
21:37:09 <dreddybajs> oh yea
21:37:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you can eat it so many other ways. do NOT put it on pizza
21:37:19 <dreddybajs> spinach and sun dried tomato is good too
21:37:27 <Selfie_Dad> broccoli is good if ur oven is hot enuff to roast it
21:37:29 <HellaBrad> spinach is good, on pizza is really the only place i tolerate those little black olives
21:37:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i see some absolutely insane vegan pizzas with like
21:37:32 <Selfie_Dad> most of the time its a wet mess though
21:37:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> b sprouts AND broccoli
21:37:54 <mpg> welp
21:37:55 <scoop_jackson> broccoli rabe on pizza is allowed but i hate it
21:37:57 <mpg> time to get pizza
21:38:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah when i make my own pizzas i cook the mushrooms down before i add them
21:38:04 <HellaBrad> no. the good pizza vegetables are olives, spinach, artichoke, onions and peppers
21:38:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> cook the pizza halfway, add mushrooms and spinach and a little more cheese, cook it the rest of the way
21:38:25 <dreddybajs> jalopenos too
21:38:31 <Selfie_Dad> the problem of pizza as a food of convenience is that any like salad or w/e u get at a pizza place sucks generally
21:38:31 <HellaBrad> mushrooms of course are a top tier ingred
21:38:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i was about t osay... not seeing mushrooms on that list
21:38:44 <mpg> when i worked at a pizza place i would make jalp and pineapple pizza
21:38:45 <Selfie_Dad> unless its a fancier place in which case i'd rather eat something else for the money
21:38:47 <mpg> i am ungovernable
21:38:51 <eric> the cave exploring music is really good 
21:38:53 <HellaBrad> yeah any kind of pepper cooks up good on a pizza dreddybajs
21:38:59 <eric> just quavering bowed string instruments
21:38:59 <dreddybajs> that sounds good mpg and im not especially a pineapple pizza guy
21:39:11 <mpg> its the sweet and spicy mix that makes it work
21:39:17 <Selfie_Dad> the crazy veggie pizza at the place down the road here has fuckin corn on it for some reason
21:39:19 <dreddybajs> yeah i can see it
21:39:21 <HellaBrad> jalepeno is a great complement to pineapple
21:39:30 <alansmithee_> corn is big on pizza in japan
21:39:32 <eric> yeah spicy pineapple ftw
21:39:32 <alansmithee_> corn and mayo
21:39:35 <alansmithee_> it's nuts
21:39:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when i ate meat i liked ham and pineapple
21:39:44 <HellaBrad> japanese and chinese pizza places rule
21:40:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so i guess like... when i was a teen that wa smy preferred pizza
21:40:06 <mpg> the pizza place i worked was pakastani owned, so they also had this insane chicken tikka pizza
21:40:08 <HellaBrad> in shanghai pizza hut they make the cheese stuffed crust really ornate, like a flower
21:40:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's cute brad
21:40:21 <Selfie_Dad> i dont disparage a pineapple pizza lover but its not for me
21:40:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i hate you all for talking about pizza
21:40:28 <dreddybajs> eric: oh lol i just got to the swamp millicent invasion you meant
21:40:33 <dreddybajs> i was thinking of something way further along the quest line
21:40:36 <dreddybajs> whops
21:40:37 <eric> yeah
21:40:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm hungry but i wanna wait a little bit before i have dinner
21:40:44 <eric> but i found the millicent sitting in the church too
21:40:44 <Selfie_Dad> im now going to eat: chicken and vegetable
21:40:48 <dreddybajs> yeah
21:40:48 <eric> so i thought they were the same guy
21:40:52 <Selfie_Dad> now that ive had my piza taste
21:40:52 <dreddybajs> they are
21:41:04 <eric> she didnt seem to mind being owned by me in the swamp
21:41:04 <dreddybajs> the scarlet rot making her crazy and invade u i think
21:41:09 <eric> i guess shes got other things to worry about
21:41:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have a bunch of chinese eggplants i need to do something with
21:41:11 <dreddybajs> yea
21:41:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wish i had a grill
21:41:19 <dreddybajs> thats a really good quest i would recommend helping her
21:41:20 <Selfie_Dad> roast em
21:41:23 <Selfie_Dad> broil
21:41:29 <eric> i will help whoever asks for my aid
21:41:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i'm probably gonna do sometihng like that
21:41:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> put a miso glaze on
21:41:42 <eric> yuuup
21:41:42 <dreddybajs> Paladin Eric
21:42:15 <HellaBrad> miso eggplant sounds delicious
21:42:44 <mpg> yeah
21:42:51 <Selfie_Dad> miso legplant
21:43:23 <HellaBrad> miso aubergine...
21:43:36 <eric> babaganoush is another good solution to a too much eggplant problem
21:43:52 <eric> if youre a dips and dunk fan
21:44:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah but i've got chinese style eggplant, not normal style eggplant
21:44:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> babaganoush is ftw
21:45:19 <Selfie_Dad> babaganoush ftw
21:45:22 <eric> is there a difference other than shape i dont really know
21:45:29 <HellaBrad> are they like the tiny baby ones with the white streaks?
21:46:14 <eric> theyre long and thin
21:46:22 <eric> apparently less bitter because fewer seeds
21:46:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> chinese eggplant is milder than regular eggplant
21:47:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's a little tougher as well
21:47:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it has the texture of the ends of a normal eggplant
21:47:47 <dreddybajs> americans thinking eggs are a plant ftw... xD
21:48:19 <alansmithee_> ohh la la look at mister aubergine over here
21:48:43 <dreddybajs> i just died climbing ladder, a guy stabbed me right up the ass
21:48:54 <Selfie_Dad> this mf australian
21:48:59 <HellaBrad> seems interesting to cook with, lotta recipes im seeing suggest frying the hell out of it in a big flat skillet which sounds good
21:49:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah, i use it in stir fries and thai curries mostly
21:49:23 <alansmithee_> try knife but hole
21:50:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ^
21:50:44 <alansmithee_> also dreddybajs if you know how to stop the dumb snow i'd be interested in that
21:51:02 <dreddybajs> shrimp1989dspinfo: btw my friends are using a new rune farming spot where you shoot a giant bird from far range with 1 arrow and it aggros and falls off a cliff and you get 11k runes

22:13:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but he said that he hasn't seen any
22:13:31 <alansmithee_> bloodfang was the first weapon i really used
22:13:41 <dreddybajs> lol
22:14:31 <HellaBrad> im gonna try out that wizard katana
22:14:40 <HellaBrad> if my game ever finishes updating
22:14:47 <dreddybajs> moonveil?
22:14:52 <dreddybajs> it got nerfed but is still very good apparently
22:15:26 <dreddybajs> HellaBrad: i had to go into like the "detailed" page for it updating for it to actually start patching after the dl
22:15:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i want that one but the wyrm is a pain in the ass
22:15:31 <alansmithee_> the damage isn't bad but you get punished a lot more
22:15:33 <dreddybajs> before that it was just stuck on PATCHING... forever in the library
22:15:42 <HellaBrad> yeah i found that dungeon but completely forgot to finish it like my first day playing the game
22:16:07 <NORG> mikev lol at deshaun watson killing 3 different franchises
22:16:19 <HellaBrad> went back and got it yesterday
22:16:58 <dreddybajs> anyone who has done int stuff already btw, what are the best staffs? will meteorite staff last me a long time 
22:18:20 <HellaBrad> meteorite should last you a while, the glintstone staff you get in the sorcery town in caelid is good but takes 52 int
22:18:29 <dreddybajs> nice
22:18:37 <dreddybajs> im basically just pumping int and mind so that should work
22:18:44 <mikev> lol norg what happened
22:18:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> where do you get the meteorite staff
22:18:48 <mikev> i been busy all day
22:18:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm using demi-human queen's staff
22:19:10 <mpg> i use meteorite but im not really a spellcaster but if i was id go for lusat's staff
22:19:15 <dreddybajs> in the swamp shrimp1989dspinfo 
22:19:23 <dreddybajs> at street of sages ruins (?)
22:19:28 <NORG> mikev the browns said they arent getting him after saying they wanted him
22:19:31 <NORG> so baker is demanding a trade
22:19:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> streets of rage
22:19:34 <NORG> and now the same thing happened w/ the falcons
22:19:34 <mikev> lol
22:19:35 <dreddybajs> its on a corpse in the northmost bit of the ruin buildings
22:19:37 <mikev> ahahah
22:19:37 <NORG> and matt ryan is demanding a trade
22:19:42 <mikev> badass
22:19:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i need more fp
22:19:53 <HellaBrad> if youre putting a lot of points into int the s-scaling keeps you doing lots of damage until pretty late, i went from meteorite to lusat's just because im an upgrade stone hoarder
22:20:01 <dreddybajs> hmm cool
22:20:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm going through the raya lucaria tunnel right now
22:20:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the crystal one
22:20:49 <HellaBrad> the boss there is fun
22:20:58 <dreddybajs> oh yea
22:21:03 <dreddybajs> you get the smithing stone bell bearing for that too
22:21:04 <dreddybajs> for 1s and 2s
22:21:08 <dreddybajs> or maybe the somber one idr
22:21:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah that's what i want
22:21:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> is th eboss hard to kill
22:21:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have like 16k runes on me
22:21:41 <dreddybajs> no, but theyre like the crystal guys that you do zero damage to until you stagger them once
22:21:49 <dreddybajs> and then a crit will basically insta kill them
22:21:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> well now i don't because i fell down a cliff twice
22:21:57 <dreddybajs> lol
22:21:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> farwell runes
22:22:02 <dreddybajs> rip
22:22:58 <alansmithee_> the staff you get from rennia is better than the meteorite when you upgrade it but yeah otherwise it's good
22:23:52 <HellaBrad> yeah if you use a blunt weapon on the crystal guys they take massive damage, you bust em up
22:24:15 <eric> anyone doing their job seems to be weak to whip
22:26:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> alright i've died like 10 times in this cave now
22:26:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i didn't die a single time before asking about the boss

22:56:19 <HellaBrad> elden ring has made a rube of me yet again but i think after this fourth patch attempt i will finally have fixed the problem
22:56:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> is it still not working?
22:57:47 <HellaBrad> its still telling me it needs to validate or redownload the full 48.2gb game file which seems preposterous
22:58:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's insane
22:58:14 <HellaBrad> but theres no way to argue with the steam downloads page lol
22:58:19 <HellaBrad> yeah

23:06:48 <HellaBrad> he senses the high status the chicken possesses as a treat
23:06:56 <HellaBrad> he yearns for the pleasures of our world
23:09:48 <Nude_Riker> lol i stopped playing warzone the first time time i had to patch it, 120gb download for a patch fuck off
23:10:46 <HellaBrad> yeah even if your game is free i just can't dedicate all that hard drive space no thanks
23:12:34 <HellaBrad> i used to play a fair bit of apex with my brother and his friends as well but that was eating up too much space
