15:40:58 <Nude_Riker> i was at the store and thought hm i want one that has less than 240mg caffeine and it was less than a dollar
15:43:36 <Selfie_Dad> yeah dollar is a fair price 
15:43:47 <Selfie_Dad> especially when so many are creeping past the 3 dollar mark
15:43:59 <Nude_Riker> tracking updates can be so funny, seeing the different elements contradict each other

15:44:28 <mpg> that whole building is full of idiot degenerates
15:44:39 <HellaBrad> appreciate the concept of going out to buy an energy drink and specifically looking for the one that has the least amount of energy drink ingredients
15:44:42 <HellaBrad> good compromise
15:44:54 <Nude_Riker> updated delivery "today", status "Package not due for delivery
15:44:54 <Nude_Riker> "
15:45:13 <Nude_Riker> well since starting adderall caffeine is mostly not good for/to me
15:45:19 <HellaBrad> thats good bureaucracy
15:46:01 <bonegar> they should sell adderall in stores
15:46:06 <HellaBrad> ^ 
15:46:35 <greatest_gamer> i’m going to open a store and sell Guns and Adderall
15:46:46 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'll be your best customer
15:46:46 <mpg> what could go wrong
15:46:56 <wild_ape-style_creature> give me the homie discount
15:47:05 <greatest_gamer> what hasn’t already gone wrong *chin stroke*
15:47:05 <HellaBrad> its a good cyclical business model
15:47:06 <Rusty> how different are adderall and ritalin
15:47:09 <bonegar> everyone is so productive and well protected in this community
15:47:10 <wild_ape-style_creature> guns, adderall, and diesel jeans
15:47:20 <Nude_Riker> Rusty, depends on the person, chemically very different
15:47:22 <mpg> and oakley wraparound sunglasses
15:47:42 <wild_ape-style_creature> i want to shoot a gun but i don't want to drive all the way home right now
15:47:54 <greatest_gamer> adderall hits hella different when you have diesels on
15:48:02 <bonegar> i want to shoot a gun but it's too stressful to figure out how to buy a gun
15:48:10 <greatest_gamer> wha
15:48:14 <wild_ape-style_creature> you go to the gun store and you say one gun please
15:48:19 <wild_ape-style_creature> and they give you a gun
15:48:21 <wild_ape-style_creature> simple
15:48:23 <greatest_gamer> ya any gun you want
15:48:24 <bonegar> so i gotta go to a store? strike one.
15:48:41 <HellaBrad> paying a taskrabbit to bring me a gun
15:48:43 <greatest_gamer> you can get a online gun but you gotta go to a store for it if it’s a real gun
15:48:45 <mpg> ill have a machine gun, and one clip please
15:48:49 <Selfie_Dad> well you could probably just meet a guy in a parking lot
15:48:56 <Nude_Riker> yeah buying a gun is complicated
15:48:56 <wild_ape-style_creature> mpg you can buy all thje parts to make one 
15:48:56 <greatest_gamer> cause you gotta do FFL transfer
15:48:59 <wild_ape-style_creature> and assemble it yourself
15:49:07 <bonegar> not even sure if gun stores are real
15:49:07 <mpg> too much work
15:49:11 <bonegar> also i might not be enough of a nazi
15:49:21 <greatest_gamer> Selfie_Dad: nah the unregistered market has been driven underground since armstrader banned it
15:49:23 <mpg> phased plasma rifle 
15:49:24 <Nude_Riker> assembling it myself would be a plus its the paperwork and stores thats annoying
15:49:26 <mpg> in the 50 wtt range
15:49:27 <greatest_gamer> and started doing way more KYC stuff
15:49:28 <wild_ape-style_creature> why would uou have to be a nazi to buy a gun
15:49:29 <bonegar> gotta buy a shirt with an 88 on it i guess and pretend i love cops
15:49:30 <wild_ape-style_creature> guns are for everyone
15:49:45 <greatest_gamer> you have to like get into the scene to get an unregistered gun or get one without doing an FFL transfer
15:49:48 <wild_ape-style_creature> most gun ppl don't care about that, they literally only care about if you like guns
15:49:50 <Selfie_Dad> i could easily get a gun, i am white and have a mgla t shirt
15:49:52 <mpg> lol
15:49:53 <HellaBrad> guns are for everyone
15:49:55 <mpg> "the scene"

15:50:04 <wild_ape-style_creature> i can drive home and select one of dozens of guns
15:50:08 <wild_ape-style_creature> or perhaps all of them
15:50:16 <wild_ape-style_creature> i can supply a whole militia when ym parents die
15:50:19 <Selfie_Dad> i gotta couple pussy ass guns upstairs
15:50:22 <Selfie_Dad> someone can have those
15:50:25 <mpg> i only wear pantera shirts when i shoot guns
15:50:29 <Selfie_Dad> they arent registered
15:50:33 <wild_ape-style_creature> hell yeah
15:50:34 <scoop_jackson> you should get an ak like alansmithee_ bonegar
15:50:46 <mpg> scoop_jackson: andrey also has an ak

15:50:50 <wild_ape-style_creature> get the school shooter gun
15:50:53 <greatest_gamer> my shotgun is registered to me so i am committing a lot of crimes by also having weed
15:50:55 <scoop_jackson> there you go
15:50:56 <greatest_gamer> the atf would be so mad
15:51:00 <wild_ape-style_creature> the school shooter gun is easy and fun to shoot
15:51:00 <scoop_jackson> official phiz weapon

15:52:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> or was it alex who got killed
15:52:41 <wild_ape-style_creature> wouldn't want to make the people closest to me clean my brains off the wall
15:52:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> i know it was matt that killed me
15:52:50 <wild_ape-style_creature> they already have to deal with me killing myself, why add to that
15:52:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> by running over me while i was trying to get into the car
15:52:56 <wild_ape-style_creature> so guns are safe in my possession
15:53:03 <mpg> scoop_jackson: yeah it was especially scary when i was in full covid/sleep deprivation delerium mode
15:53:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> greatest_gamer: while we're at it do you also have tomjump.m4a
15:53:23 <bonegar> i have nobody close to me, so my brains would only be my landlord's problem, which is ETHICAL
15:53:28 <wild_ape-style_creature> true
15:53:28 <mpg> that was when i gave it to my friend to put in his gun safe forever

16:06:56 <Melber> aw man the o's have the lowest payroll in baseball this season god damnit
16:07:20 <Melber>  namely that teams that don’t want to try are trying about 30 percent less than a year ago—and at roughly year 2000 levels, without factoring in a 60 percent rise in inflation. In other words, the Orioles are spending the 2000 equivalent of $18.4 million. 
16:07:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> matt only uploaded his videos on streamable smfh
16:08:38 <Melber> Mike Trout will make $35,541,667 this season.  About 5 million more than the entire 2022 Orioles.

16:11:32 <Melber> also Nude_Riker did you see the menu i posted for the dinner i had
16:11:42 <mpg> i dont have discord notifications on
16:11:48 <het> I mean that's not a discord bug
16:11:55 <het> like there's no reason to blame discord for that
16:11:59 <mpg> its like a windows bug
16:12:04 <Melber> id assume chrome

16:13:38 <wild_ape-style_creature> oh shoot i forgot about that
16:13:46 <Nude_Riker> though adding several of those mushrooms seems like a bad idea/odd to me
16:13:46 <wild_ape-style_creature> i never got my ticket
16:14:10 <Selfie_Dad> ok cool i think i just figured out a way around my issue w/ soundbar
16:14:16 <mpg> we still also have to figure out who is in for mdf but if i am the only one going to the shows that will be a problem for me
16:14:18 <Nude_Riker> like reishi has no culinary value, it's just kind of bitter
16:14:19 <Selfie_Dad> i can just airplay from the macmini to the soundbar
16:14:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> im sure there are still tickets or you could cop at the door
16:14:37 <Nude_Riker> bet it rocked tho
16:14:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> probably cheaper in advance tho
16:14:39 <Melber> the reishi helped mute the sweetness a little, that was a very good dessert
16:14:52 <wild_ape-style_creature> you guys are going to another show before, right?
16:14:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
16:15:06 <wild_ape-style_creature> hmm
16:16:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> i expect that show will be over by like 11 or something
16:16:12 <Nude_Riker> how was the cordyceps integrated into the first dish Melber ?
16:16:35 <Melber> well turns out i dont like scallops all that much but 
16:16:43 <Melber> actually hold on i might have a picture

16:17:38 <Nude_Riker> ah ok so whole, probably lightly sauteed?
16:17:41 <Melber> not a great picture because lynz took it and was sending them as texts
16:17:48 <Melber> they were sorta crispy
16:17:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> what is this a pcicture for ants

17:11:15 <Melber> which makes turning stuff over like that super easy, and also lets me get them plated easier
17:11:26 <Melber> the other was instead of doing cornmeal i ground up saltines

17:20:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> completely guessing on macros for this sushi
17:20:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> the packaged sushi options on here didnt seem right at all
17:20:50 <Selfie_Dad> just add the generic ones
17:20:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> there arent any generic ones
17:20:57 <Selfie_Dad> does it have a barcode, scan the barcode
17:21:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> no it was ordered from a restaurant
17:21:10 <Selfie_Dad> well like, whats the roll
17:21:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> its different rolls
17:21:19 <Selfie_Dad> e.g. you can search 'california roll' or we
17:21:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah and it only gives you branded packaged ones
17:21:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> which again do not seem right at all
17:22:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> i weighed the whole tray of sushi, subtracted about 50 grams for packaging, and came up with this as a guess on distribution
17:22:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/sTztY3qP/IMG_8251.PNG
17:22:44 <Selfie_Dad> i would just log it as a california roll by weight
17:22:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> there is no option for this
17:22:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> i promise you
17:23:02 <Selfie_Dad> im looking at it right now brother
17:23:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> we already determined you get different resutls on your app
17:23:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> than i do
17:23:20 <Selfie_Dad> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/LGX2WIiv/1648056195.JPG
17:23:23 <Selfie_Dad> no, i switched to the new db that you use
17:23:24 <Selfie_Dad> lol
17:23:29 <Selfie_Dad> so i can replicate ur shit too
17:23:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> that didnt come up for me
17:24:02 <Selfie_Dad> make sure ur on the all or common tab
17:24:13 <Selfie_Dad> there arnt a lot of roll options but california and tuna are ones
17:24:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> ok i did find it now
17:24:26 <Selfie_Dad> i'd just use one of those by weight and a couple tbsp of mayo probably if its a mayo sauce thing
17:24:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk why it didnt come up before
17:24:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> one of them has mayo but also one of them has cucumber which is a bunch of weight for no calories so it probably all evens out
17:25:00 <Selfie_Dad> i'd just log the mayo anyway
17:25:10 <Selfie_Dad> better to overcount a little bit when you're cutting than to undercount
17:25:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah idk i guess
17:25:39 <Selfie_Dad> but mosly the mayo and the rice are the only really calorie dense parts of thse
17:26:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> well theres chunks of tuna in the tuna rolls and those are fairly protein dense
17:26:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> theres also avocado
17:26:22 <Selfie_Dad> yeah thats true
17:26:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> none of this is california roll actually but im just going to go with that
17:26:31 <Selfie_Dad> california roll should account for avocado right
17:26:37 <Selfie_Dad> isnt there avocado in that
17:26:43 <Selfie_Dad> or am i thinking of something else
17:26:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah theres avocado in california roll
17:27:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> but tuna will definitely be more dense than crab stick]
17:27:12 <Selfie_Dad> yeah tuna is protein dense but not calory dense, they have sashimi in there if u wanna log the tuna seperately i guess
17:27:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> but also one of these rolls is salmon skin and cucumber so
17:27:18 <Rusty> drake busting in, uninvited- I LOVE YA SUSHI ROLL, HOTTER THAN WASABI
17:27:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> again, probabyl evens out
17:27:24 <Selfie_Dad> lol
17:27:33 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i wouldnt stress over it
17:27:34 <Selfie_Dad> its one meal
17:27:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> not stressing
17:27:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> just talking through trying to deal with an unfamiliar challenge
17:28:32 <Selfie_Dad> yeah im not saying you are just trying to impart that i dont think its crucial you get this 100% or anything, i didnt want to stress u out being a psycho about this shit
17:28:58 <Selfie_Dad> because i am, in fact, a psycho about this shit
17:29:11 <Selfie_Dad> BUT~! i am as of today a 159 lb psycho
17:29:21 <scoop_jackson> lol yeah i was gonna say "says the guy that would manually enter his last.fm plays after driving"
17:31:48 <Selfie_Dad> excuse me. i used a service to do that
17:32:07 <het> have you guys listened to black braid? native american black metal https://blackbraid.bandcamp.com/
17:32:20 <Selfie_Dad> i definitely never used a csv file to log plays from an itunes libray 
17:32:27 <Selfie_Dad> i have not het
17:32:29 <Selfie_Dad> seems cool
17:33:22 <Selfie_Dad> oh btw Homie_in_a_geod did you do the weekly check in thing on monday/did it  make changes to your targets
17:35:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> it did not
17:35:22 <Selfie_Dad> that makes sense i guess cause you've only had the scale for a lil while
17:35:33 <Selfie_Dad> but next week im curious to see what it does for you
17:37:31 <Selfie_Dad> lol, great meme posted on hospital intranet https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/9lCFsWHF/apnea.jpg

17:44:58 <mpg> good meme will
17:45:38 <mpg> Homie_in_a_geod: you have inspired me to do a sushi lunch as well
17:47:04 <het> I had black bean nachos for lunch
17:48:03 <mpg> that sounds good too
17:49:15 <mpg> big sushi time coming through
17:51:09 <Nude_Riker> sushi i want
17:51:41 <Selfie_Dad> sushi good
17:51:49 <Selfie_Dad> i need to go eat it at restaurant though
17:52:11 <Nude_Riker> yeah
17:52:17 <Selfie_Dad> last couple of times i got it takeout it wasnt as satisfying
17:53:00 <Nude_Riker> ive never done takeout or delivery sushi, just grocery store sushi which i have lower expectations for
17:53:22 <Nude_Riker> though the to go sushi from the japanese markets i was near in los angeles were obviously quite good
17:55:05 <mpg> the takeout here is good
17:55:19 <mpg> i don't think the travel is an issue at all
17:55:31 <mpg> maybe a little for crunchy rolls, but not really for sashimi

18:08:42 <wild_ape-style_creature> i wish i had the honda that sends owners back in time to 2002
18:11:23 <Nude_Riker> yeah automatic car updates seem like bad cyber future
18:11:47 <wild_ape-style_creature> i don't like that mine has a touch screen
18:12:02 <wild_ape-style_creature> i take my eyes off the road too much to adjust music because i can't just reach out and touch the buttons
18:12:18 <wild_ape-style_creature> can't use my ipod in my car either because i don't have an aux port so i have ot use flash drives
18:12:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> touch screen in a car is psycho
18:12:40 <Nude_Riker> yeah touch interface fuckin blows
18:12:53 <Nude_Riker> absolutely insane to have usb and no aux lmao
18:12:58 <Nude_Riker> everything sucks
18:13:35 <wild_ape-style_creature> yep!!
18:13:40 <bonegar> yeah i do like that mine isn't a touch screen and has a dial, but any forced UI update feels very bad
18:13:41 <mpg> dont hondas have steering wheel controls
18:13:54 <wild_ape-style_creature> not for going through folders
18:13:55 <mpg> every time i rent a cr-v it has that
18:13:56 <wild_ape-style_creature> just tracks
18:14:05 <mpg> oh yeah that makes sense
18:14:11 <wild_ape-style_creature> and i ahve my music sorted on the flash drive the same way i do on my pc

18:15:32 <wild_ape-style_creature> i wanna remove the touch screen panel and put a normal thing in but i think that would cost too much
18:15:41 <Nude_Riker> the system in my subaru is not ideal but it has aux and physical buttons for everything so thats good enough
18:15:48 <wild_ape-style_creature> i also want to install an aux port but it seems too complicated
18:16:03 <wild_ape-style_creature> my car is the first year they removed aux ports
18:16:07 <Nude_Riker> go andrey style and just have an amp hooked up to the speakers on the floor
18:16:07 <Selfie_Dad> lol going thru folders 
18:16:17 <wild_ape-style_creature> i think they replaced them in newer models
18:16:26 <wild_ape-style_creature> lmao matt
18:16:27 <wild_ape-style_creature> amybe i should
18:16:28 <Selfie_Dad> very 2008 method of car music playing
18:16:44 <wild_ape-style_creature> i've tried using a bluetooth thing with my ipod but the ipod is too old for it
18:16:48 <bonegar> plugging an ipod into a car ftw
18:16:50 <Nude_Riker> honestly i think its ideal
18:16:59 <Nude_Riker> fuck to bluetooth
18:17:02 <bonegar> i miss the old ways
18:17:03 <wild_ape-style_creature> agree
18:17:04 <Selfie_Dad> not if u have to scroll thru folders
18:17:06 <wild_ape-style_creature> bluetooth is gay
18:17:13 <Selfie_Dad> yeah bluetooth sucks i plug my phone in direct usb
18:17:16 <wild_ape-style_creature> it's so much faster/safer to use ipod
18:17:51 <bonegar> i end up using my phone a lot when driving, because carplay isn't smart enough to download a podcast by itself, without me poking at my phone and telling it to
18:17:52 <wild_ape-style_creature> i can scroll really fast instead of trying to angle my finger exactly right to hit the down arrow while praying i don't get the stupid popup saying i can't scroll and needto wait til the car is stopped
18:18:00 <mpg> haha bluetooth works fine for me when i rent
18:18:05 <mpg> guess im blessed
18:18:26 <Selfie_Dad> bluetooth works fine but i prefer the fidelity of usb direct
18:18:26 <Nude_Riker> i had to use bluetooth when i drove my car oregon to la and that shit fucking sucked lmao
18:18:42 <Nude_Riker> it kept having to re-pair, kept dropping and so on
18:18:47 <Selfie_Dad> there is a clear difference in the audio quality in my car 
18:18:50 <Nude_Riker> bought a cable as soon as i could
18:18:56 <Selfie_Dad> and yeah it drops every so often too
18:19:29 <bonegar> i like the design of my insturment panel and display, it's just everything has more points of failure when you doing Car OS > Phone OS > App 
18:19:44 <Selfie_Dad> yeah ive not fucked around w/ carplay much
18:19:50 <Selfie_Dad> not a lot of experience with it
18:20:02 <Selfie_Dad> it seems like it would be easier to just interact w/ the phone in many cases
18:20:07 <bonegar> i like it overall, it just has classic Software Dumbguy problems
18:20:21 <Nude_Riker> there was some really weird stuff going on with like partial match between the car and my phone where some interaction other than audio was happening but not consistently
18:20:25 <Selfie_Dad> i think a lot of those things are oriented towards psychos who like to use voice control for stuff
18:20:38 <Nude_Riker> like the next button sometimes worked and sometimes like crashed the stereo lmao
18:20:51 <wild_ape-style_creature> what is carplay
18:20:51 <bonegar> when it works right it's great, but it's just very dumb about like... downloading a podcast or w/e
18:20:59 <bonegar> iOS stuff
18:21:02 <wild_ape-style_creature> oh
18:21:08 <Selfie_Dad> its the apple UI for car
18:21:28 <Selfie_Dad> like if u select a podcast from carplay it wont stream it bonegar?
18:21:34 <Selfie_Dad> that seems like, the most basic shit
18:21:34 <bonegar> it's good for using apple/google maps
18:21:40 <Selfie_Dad> yeah the map UI is good
18:22:01 <bonegar> yeah, i have to pick up my phone and tell my phone to download the episode, for whatever reason carplay just can't do that
18:22:04 <bonegar> some sort of design issue
18:22:06 <Selfie_Dad> i wonder if there are any other podcast apps that support carplay
18:22:19 <Selfie_Dad> because the apple podcasts app has many frustrating things about it
18:22:36 <bonegar> the map stuff is nice but they constantly are adding invasive prediction features like "OH YOU WANT TO GO HOME?" 
18:22:37 <Selfie_Dad> i love when you stream a podcast and pause it, and then come back later and it has to redownload the whole thing for some reason
18:22:40 <bonegar> just fuck off with that shit
18:22:42 <Selfie_Dad> just cache it for 24h jesus christ
18:23:06 <Selfie_Dad> yeah every time i sit down in my car my phone lights up and tells me how long it will take me to drive to daycare lol
18:23:08 <bonegar> i've tried a few different apps, it's just dumb about it
18:23:18 <bonegar> its one of those things that seems like it should work but doesn't
18:23:29 <Selfie_Dad> u can turn all those things off but i havent bothered
18:23:44 <bonegar> i turned them all off once, but they'll just turn it back on again
18:25:16 <bonegar> software engineers belong in hell
18:34:22 <scoop_jackson> yeah i subscribe to too many podcasts on the apple app so its slow and buggy
18:34:53 <bonegar> it's amazing how something that should be very simple is very bad at working and being used
18:51:12 <scoop_jackson> im finally caught up on the monthly work

19:09:49 <Selfie_Dad> or possibly way too sweet
19:09:52 <Selfie_Dad> hard to tell

19:10:10 <bonegar> eating a whole one of those is a nightmare... i can only handle half of one of those

19:12:00 <HellaBrad> Yeah I cant eat creme eggs. Even the lil candy coated mini eggs are a little too sugary after like a handful. I did like the new cookies and creme eggs they came out with this year tho
19:12:11 <Selfie_Dad> windsor loves the mini eggs
19:12:19 <Selfie_Dad> theyre good but 1 or 2 is enough for sure
19:12:37 <bonegar> never seen the mini ones
19:12:56 <scoop_jackson> .g creme egg mcflurry are they in america
19:13:00 <Selfie_Dad> theyre not creme filled

19:13:05 <Selfie_Dad> theyre just chocolate
19:13:15 <dreddybajs> but yeah theyre heavy
19:13:26 <dreddybajs> always hated creme eggs
19:13:30 <het> cadbury creme eggs are kinda bad imho
19:13:34 <dreddybajs> they had caramel eggs for a while though
19:13:37 <dreddybajs> i liked those as a kid
19:13:40 <het> yeah the caramel is better
19:13:48 <Selfie_Dad> they still make the caramel ones
19:13:57 <dreddybajs> nice
19:14:20 <het> I like the robins eggs for easter candy where it's the malted milk ball center
19:14:29 <scoop_jackson> i like cadbury creme egg but i can only have a little
19:14:31 <dreddybajs> lindt do nice ones here
19:14:34 <dreddybajs> and chocolate bunnies 
19:14:53 <Selfie_Dad> yeah lindt are good
19:15:01 <bonegar> taking one bite out of a creme egg and giving the rest to your boyfriend/husband/loving-to-eat-big-style-friend ftw tho

19:18:50 <wild_ape-style_creature> we do
19:18:50 <ehn> theyre the best
19:18:55 <wild_ape-style_creature> i see  them at wegmans
19:19:06 <wild_ape-style_creature> they're salt and vin + bbq flavor
19:19:06 <ehn> the US excluded flavors of Ketchup and All Dressed are the best ones
19:19:10 <ehn> unless US gets ketchup now
19:19:11 <ehn> hup

19:20:12 <bonegar> that makes no sense a pig would eat any flavor of chip
19:20:13 <ehn> I would guess that all dressed chips are by far the best selling in canada
19:20:14 <ehn> of all
19:20:29 <bonegar> they need to sell them here
19:20:36 <bonegar> unless it's a fake political thing

19:26:54 <scoop_jackson> wait they have all dressed chips all over the place here
19:26:58 <bonegar> all pringles taste terrible due to their weird texture of powdered meal reshaped into a chip imo
19:27:07 <scoop_jackson> bullshit there is no hot pot and all dressed chips everywhere
19:27:11 <HellaBrad> dessert pringles seem like a nightmare
19:27:16 <wild_ape-style_creature> they stopped using milk in the nromal pringles os i can eat them again
19:27:17 <antiracist_baby> desert pringles
19:27:26 <wild_ape-style_creature> steve likes pringles so i had them for the first time in many years

19:28:07 <wild_ape-style_creature> i love to scrape up my mouth with a crunchy chip
19:28:20 <antiracist_baby> kettle chips ftw
19:28:41 <bonegar> kettle chips means i have to lay down because i hurt my stomach eating too many kettle chips
19:28:53 <HellaBrad> these are some of my fave kettle chips https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/Qej49oCC/image.png
19:28:55 <dreddybajs> kettle chips extremely ftw
19:29:02 <bonegar> gotta dip them in water like a sailor or something
19:29:13 <dreddybajs> that sounds good HellaBrad 
19:29:14 <wild_ape-style_creature> sweet onion chips are ok
19:29:20 <wild_ape-style_creature> i like spicy chips
19:29:20 <bonegar> never seen those chips
19:29:26 <wild_ape-style_creature> i like calbee hot and spicy
19:29:44 <bonegar> thos ecalbee ones are classic
19:29:47 <wild_ape-style_creature> they aren't spicy at all but they taste good
19:29:52 <wild_ape-style_creature> .gis calbee hot and spicy
19:29:55 <bonegar> i will get that at the asian market sometimes
19:30:05 <wild_ape-style_creature> love that little guy
19:30:06 <HellaBrad> the new kettle™-brand truffle ruffles were really good too
19:30:08 <bonegar> classic
19:30:27 <bonegar> now that they killed mr tayto only the calbee guy remains
19:30:38 <wild_ape-style_creature> king of the taters
19:30:49 <letty> i quite like those cheese puffs but theres no cheese on them, they just taste dry and like peanuts
19:30:58 <letty> bamba?
19:31:05 <dreddybajs> theres a new tayto ad where a guy tries to steal crisps and gets trapped in a giant mousetrap
19:31:13 <dreddybajs> and then mr tayto appears and throws crisps at him
19:31:22 <dreddybajs> .y tayto ad 2022
19:31:28 <bonegar> sod off with your bojo monster munch 
19:31:31 <letty> mr tayto willing to sacrifice his own kind

19:32:11 <letty> did you try the mr tayto cheese and onion chocolate bar dreddybajs?
19:32:18 <dreddybajs> all i ever heard about tayto park was that an alarming number of animals were dying there
19:32:23 <dreddybajs> yes of course letty
19:32:28 <letty> lol
19:32:32 <dreddybajs> it's terrible, as you might expect
19:32:42 <letty> could you actually take the onion
19:32:47 <letty> *taste
19:33:19 <dreddybajs> i don't remember specifically other than it being revolting
19:33:29 <bonegar> until the 6 counties are united tayto park will remain closed
19:33:41 <antiracist_baby> ;lmf,apo
19:33:42 <antiracist_baby> that video
19:34:26 <wild_ape-style_creature> i wish western products had more mascots

19:35:47 <wild_ape-style_creature> she has somewhere she needs to be
19:36:49 <antiracist_baby> ubereats has a delivery estimate and then a "latest arrival by" time which i guess is supposed to be a worst case scenario
19:37:02 <antiracist_baby> but, when the estimate gets pushed back it pushes back the latest arrival time too
19:37:04 <antiracist_baby> so what the fuck is the point

19:37:18 <antiracist_baby> asinine
19:37:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> Gaybo girl defends sad Mr Tayto tweet
19:37:37 <wild_ape-style_creature> mfa
19:37:43 <bonegar> im hungry now this sux
19:37:53 <dreddybajs> rip gaybo
19:38:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> "Gaybo girl defends sad Mr Tayto tweet" is the sumerian dog joke of our time
19:38:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> in 4000 years someone will see that and go insane trying to parse it
19:38:15 <bonegar> no idea what gaybo means
19:38:16 <antiracist_baby> did you know theres two different tayto companies for ireland and northern ireland
19:38:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> yes
19:38:36 <dreddybajs> yeah
19:38:41 <dreddybajs> thats what that vid is about
19:38:46 <dreddybajs> northern irish tayto is inedible
19:38:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> bonegar: gay byrne (nicknamed gaybo) is some irish tv presenter who died
19:38:50 <antiracist_baby> i heard northern irish tayto is better
19:38:52 <bonegar> im convinced i understand the sumerian dog joke
19:38:59 <dreddybajs> you heard wrong.
19:39:00 <wild_ape-style_creature> gaybo
19:39:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> and tayto made a tweet showing a sad mr tayto in memory of Gaybo
19:39:10 <Nude_Riker> i feel like i get the gist but i wont claim to be able to explain the sumerian dog joke
19:39:12 <dreddybajs> he was like the johnny carson of irish tv Homie_in_a_geod 
19:39:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> people made fun of it or were angry of it or something, and his daughter "Gaybo girl" defended it
19:39:30 <antiracist_baby> im looking up this sumerian dog joke
19:39:36 <dreddybajs> its a good one
19:39:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> that is the explanation of Gaybo girl defends sad Mr Tayto tweet
19:39:40 <antiracist_baby> lmao
19:39:46 <bonegar> i imagine a dog gets into a bar and goes into the poop pot instead of the beer pot
19:39:50 <bonegar> because its a dog
19:40:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> hm
19:40:26 <bonegar> the dog definitely picked the wrong one to open i think
19:40:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> that makes sense
19:40:36 <bonegar> from a human pov
19:40:48 <dreddybajs> .gis sumerian poop pot
19:40:54 <dreddybajs> hmm
19:41:28 <bonegar> it could be the garbage pot, something of this nature
19:41:30 <antiracist_baby> I can't see a thing. I'll open this one.
19:41:34 <dreddybajs> ^
19:41:36 <bonegar> either way i think pots are involved
19:42:43 <bonegar> basically no difference between an ancient sumerian joke and some guy telling me a joke in 2022, i'll barely be able to comprehend anyway
19:43:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> greatest_gamer: how rich are you now 
19:43:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have an investment opportunity for you
19:43:28 <HellaBrad> I think it's funny because dogs cant open doors
19:43:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1506683108787204099
19:43:48 <bonegar> <HellaBrad> I think it's funny because dogs cant open doors <- what do you know about sumerian doors that we dont
19:43:59 <bonegar> this guy knows some door secrets
19:44:01 <Nude_Riker> .gis sumerian doors
19:44:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> phiz project: pool together 125 million dollars
19:44:20 <bonegar> ok you can have all my dollars
19:44:52 <bonegar> .gis sumerian archetecture
19:45:04 <bonegar> i forgot about ziggurats lol
19:45:08 <bonegar> classic idea

19:45:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> Cotton Candy was invented by Dr.
19:45:39 <dreddybajs> is adam page splitting with dark order or are they just joshin around
19:45:52 <HellaBrad> The first doctor, before they had to differentiate by surname
19:45:53 <dreddybajs> i guess theyre just joshin
19:47:09 <dreddybajs> mpg: i watched dist's any% old patch run this morning, some clutch stuff in there
19:47:12 <dreddybajs> what a god
19:47:37 <bonegar> a lot of survival crafting games kinda force you to build a zigarraut unintentionally, because you need to flatten out a bunch of land
19:47:50 <bonegar> which i think is cool
19:48:26 <mpg> yeah that was a pretty insane run
19:48:28 <bonegar> when i played that atlas game i would just make a bunch of small towns, but everyone wanted to roleplay warhammer guys which wasnt cool
19:50:00 <mpg> lobos also did an sl1 run that was pretty intense to watch
19:50:04 <mpg> a real journey
19:50:07 <dreddybajs> nice
19:50:21 <dreddybajs> i see carian retaliation is the cheap shit now
19:50:25 <dreddybajs> watching his all remembrances run
19:50:26 <mpg> yeah
19:50:28 <mpg> very broken
19:50:34 <dreddybajs> i wonder if thats good in pvp
19:50:53 <mpg> it is, when you cast it the enemy player cant even see the spell lol
19:51:08 <dreddybajs> damn nice
19:51:22 <bonegar> whats sl1
19:51:30 <dreddybajs> soul level 1
19:51:38 <antiracist_baby> .g the oldest jokes
19:51:39 <dreddybajs> play as wretch and dont level up basically
19:51:50 <bonegar> British historians
19:52:08 <bonegar> that's the joke
19:52:51 <mpg> lobos was using the finger weapon for a bunch of it. very silly
19:53:06 <mpg> i still havent even got that thing
19:53:13 <dreddybajs> ohh i get what he's doing now, he's using the bell projectile and he can parry it with his own carian retaliation straight away?
19:53:20 <dreddybajs> that'll get patched i presume
19:54:18 <mpg> yeah it will def get patched
19:54:32 <mpg> they were saying the things that get patched the quickest are the stuff that breaks pvp
19:54:44 <dreddybajs> yea
19:54:45 <mpg> as if pvp wont be eternally unbalanced
19:55:19 <bonegar> if you're talking elden ring, i really hope they don't go the blizzard path and constantly patch it
19:55:49 <antiracist_baby> 19 jokes and references from 'Shrek' that probably went over your head as a kid
19:55:58 <dreddybajs> i think they usually just patch the really dumb stuff
19:56:05 <bonegar> i'd rather it be a broken weird game, i guess if they fix some core mechanic stuff like arcane not working that's fine but PATCH NOTES is not fun 
19:56:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> our comfortable stationary bike seat has arrived
19:56:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> perhaps i shall ride the boike later
19:56:29 <dreddybajs> they dont want the people who want to pvp to lose to the silly stuff like the previous greatshield glitch
19:56:34 <dreddybajs> or get 1 shot by beams
19:56:59 <dreddybajs> but yeah i think past that point they'll just let people have fun
19:57:23 <ajj2> there was stuff that was broken in pvp for years in ds1 / 2 lol
19:57:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> dreddybajs you should build a paper edh deck and play online with me. and also other people
19:57:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> or on tts or something idk
19:57:51 <dreddybajs> id do it if we got a phiz game goin or somethin
19:57:57 <dreddybajs> but im not really bothered playing with randomers lol
19:57:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> im going to try to do more dsa organizing stuff irl because its probably the best way to meet people who play mtg
19:58:05 <ajj2> lol
19:58:06 <ehn> lol
19:58:06 <Nude_Riker> lol
19:58:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh yeah i meant like with your friends or with other people we know

19:58:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> thank you everyone for the lols
19:58:26 <dreddybajs> i dunno how well tts works, i know edh players like spelltable for playing with paper cards over webcam
19:58:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah the thing with spelltable is that you actually need a paper deck
19:59:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> sydney would play too so thats 3 people
19:59:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> i almost went and built another deck yesterday lol
19:59:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> restrained myself from doing so
20:00:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> but a lonis cryptozoologist deck would be fun i think
20:00:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> with panharmonicon and academy manufactor
20:01:29 <dreddybajs> lol

20:07:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> hm thats a good idea
20:07:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats probably more fun than doing one of the bike rides on fuckin uh
20:07:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> the peloton app
20:07:52 <dreddybajs> lmao
20:07:57 <dreddybajs> how does he miss the dudley boyz theme

20:19:43 <bonegar> i remember reading some quote from madeline albright saying how she would wear specific broaches to signify various things like a scorpion broach (might be adding this, but it's something like this) to signal to various emmesaries her intent or something
20:20:08 <dreddybajs> wasnt that rbg
20:20:15 <scoop_jackson> thats not the one

20:59:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> im going to go and do some sort of stuff for local assembly candidate who us running against erik dilan
20:59:48 <ehn> eric dylan*
21:00:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> top 5 worst assemblymen of all time. think about it
21:00:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> 5. dilan 4. dilan 3. dilan 2. dilan 1. dilan
21:01:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> cool erik dilan thing:
21:01:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> He illegally acquired an "affordable housing" unit for which he exceeded the allowable income to qualify because of his connections in the real estate industry. He was punished with a $9,000 fine in January 2015.[9]
21:01:32 <ehn> nice
21:01:53 <ehn> punished for success, smh
21:04:53 <wild_ape-style_creature> https://www.nhl.com/news/evgenii-dadonov-trade-to-anaheim-by-vegas-canceled/c-332182368 lmfao
21:17:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> the dadonov trade thing is so funny
21:17:30 <wild_ape-style_creature> i love it
21:17:41 <wild_ape-style_creature> i wonder if vegas truly didn't know or if they were hoping the trade office didn't notice
21:17:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> well i think part of it was that
21:17:53 <wild_ape-style_creature> i REALLY hope they don't make offs
21:17:55 <wild_ape-style_creature> it'll be so funny
21:18:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> he filed the NTC list when he was still with ottawa
21:18:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> then he was traded to vegas
21:18:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> but vegas never got the paperwork from ottawa
21:18:19 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah allegedly ottawa didn't send it over
21:18:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
21:18:22 <wild_ape-style_creature> but what about his agent?
21:18:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean i guess the agent might have been sitting back confident that the team had that paperwork, i dont think its the agents job to transfer that
21:19:24 <wild_ape-style_creature> his agent manages kuznetsov and shesterkin too lol he's not like some chump agent
21:19:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> i should note that ottawa is a notoriously horribly run organization so it would not surprise me at all if this is completely their fault
21:19:44 <wild_ape-style_creature> regardless it's insanely funny that vegas is getting owned like this
21:19:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
21:19:59 <wild_ape-style_creature> ottawa sucks ass
21:20:05 <wild_ape-style_creature> all their trades have been really funny
21:20:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> i would not be surprised if ottawa are docked a pick in the next draft
21:20:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> and vegas are awarded one
21:20:27 <wild_ape-style_creature> noooo don't say this
21:20:30 <wild_ape-style_creature> not that it'll fix vegas but
21:20:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean it would be like a 3rd probably
21:20:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats usually when compensatory picks happen
21:21:19 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm glad fleury gets to play for a not terrible team
21:21:28 <wild_ape-style_creature> i hated what vegas did to him last year
21:22:17 <wild_ape-style_creature> jets were 4-0 against vegas last night... love it
21:22:23 <wild_ape-style_creature> so much terrible shit is happening to them
21:22:24 <mpg> im fighting dragonlord placidusax and it is sincerely the most epic fight in any souls games. god dam

21:22:47 <dreddybajs> i was pissed i missed it entirely my first playthrough

21:24:49 <NORG> theres dungeons in harvest moon? maybe
21:24:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> the most tragic part of the whitehouse mcdonalds thing is that during this trump tweeted the word Hamberders, which should be one of the funniest things ever

22:57:02 <mpg> that is such an insane fight
22:57:08 <mpg> probably the most difficult
22:57:35 <mpg> then again i still have several major bosses left so
22:58:17 <Nude_Riker> this is so funny
22:58:18 <mpg> also did a yolo at the very end which gave me scarlet rot and i died during her death dialog
22:59:39 <HellaBrad> yeah i am not currently able to defeat her i think, shes so powerful
22:59:50 <HellaBrad> this grimes news is pretty wild
22:59:57 <mpg> there is no way i could do it without mimic
23:00:12 <Nude_Riker> not currently able to defeat grimes, she's so powerful
23:00:18 <mpg> lmao
23:00:21 <HellaBrad> grimes is def too strong for you
23:00:56 <wild_ape-style_creature> i can't believe grimes killed hipster runoff
23:01:04 <bonegar> you're making the alec robbins face when typing that i know it 
23:01:05 <wild_ape-style_creature> this is the most 2012 revelation i can think of
23:01:15 <HellaBrad> yeah this is taking me back
23:01:48 <Nude_Riker> lmao bonegar 
23:01:59 <Nude_Riker> i know exactly the face
23:02:11 <bonegar> https://swebtoon-phinf.pstatic.net/20200309_131/1583713396492Sa0BL_PNG/f1043950-ea23-4f68-b7fc-d36ea46f147c.png this face
23:02:25 <bonegar> 'i could never defeat grimes'
23:03:14 <alansmithee_> mimic tear is still kinda a cheat code
23:03:26 <alansmithee_> although there's one part it didn't help for shit and almost made me delete the game
23:03:34 <bonegar> not if your build is really bad like mine!
23:03:39 <alansmithee_> instead i just decided i'm gonna rush and finish it up
23:04:09 <HellaBrad> yeah try sucking a little worse at the game
23:04:12 <bonegar> im still stuck on astel and the fire giant
23:04:53 <alansmithee_> i was stuck on the fire giant and mogh for a bit, took a couple days off and came back and wrecked them both
23:05:05 <ajj2> fire giant pissed me off so much i put the game down for a week 
23:05:10 <bonegar> i gotta change up my build or something
23:05:17 <alansmithee_> it's a cool looking fight but the camera is hell
23:05:18 <bonegar> but i dont want to
23:05:23 <alansmithee_> what's your build? 
23:05:57 <bonegar> int/faith
23:06:10 <bonegar> then pretty much even everything else
23:07:02 <alansmithee_> ahh yeah i think you kinda need to go all in one or the other
23:08:02 <alansmithee_> like i think you can mix int or faith with one of the phys stats too, but together idk
23:08:03 <bonegar> it's a pretty fun build and haven't been stopped much at all, but i just crumple to these two
23:08:15 <alansmithee_> but i also kinda suck so maybe i'm just leaning on crutches
23:09:07 <NORG> https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1506762890073698305
23:09:19 <alansmithee_> lmao that's such bullshit
23:09:23 <NORG> bet all the other antivax athletes feel stupid now
23:09:33 <NORG> that got it 
23:10:16 <alansmithee_> idk if there's another athlete i disike more than kyrie who isn't just some pure shitbag. 
23:10:44 <alansmithee_> and the fact they caved for him is   just a terrible look. like just get rid of the regulations anyways nobody gives a fuck about covid anymore
23:12:26 <Selfie_Dad> lmfao grimes kills carles
23:12:29 <Selfie_Dad> ahahahha
23:13:42 <wild_ape-style_creature> this news is too much for me
23:14:03 <alansmithee_> Selfie_Dad: i've been trying to stick to that workout plan you showed me (this one: https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/3-day-full-body-dumbbell-workout) and i've done a couple changes but i had a question if you don't mind. i'm about 4 weeks into it
23:15:35 <alansmithee_> i know beffore you said try to do lower weights and 15 reps a set, and i've stuck to that for the most part. however on the lateral raises i have what i already consider a pitiful weight and i keep failing on the second set of 15. i get to about 10-12 and can't go. so today i did basically 1x15 and 2x10, is that reasonable? or should i just suck it up and drop the weight? 
23:18:26 <HellaBrad> my game crashes when i try to fight placidusax lol
23:19:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> time for a refund
23:23:03 <HellaBrad> drafting my complaint email now
23:30:57 <scoop_jackson> Lol that grimes news
23:31:21 <Selfie_Dad> what do you consider a pitiful weight
23:31:32 <bonegar> i had to do the 'verify integrity' thing on steam to fix it
23:31:33 <bonegar> and that worked
23:31:43 <Selfie_Dad> lateral raises are always a low weight exercise no shame in that game
23:32:46 <HellaBrad> i'll take a break to read and give that a try, thanks
23:34:31 <Selfie_Dad> like the most i ever do lateral raises for is 20lbs and usually more like 15lbs
23:37:48 <Selfie_Dad> but you can also just do like 3x12 and then gradually try and increase the amount of reps you get on the last set, when can you get 15 on the last set you increase the reps to 3x13 with as many as you can do on the last set, etc
23:38:33 <Selfie_Dad> its more about finding the sweet spot where you can progress than trying to barrel thru it. as long as you're doing better than last time, you're doin well, a lot of times thats easier to quantify when the weight is lower
23:47:39 <Melber> I should see if I can buy the king crimson doc somewhere
23:47:59 <Melber> Every review seems to be "wow this fripp guy seems like an asshole"
