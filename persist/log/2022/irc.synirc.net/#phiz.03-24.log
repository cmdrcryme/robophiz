00:07:05 <Selfie_Dad> .gis unbelievable penis
00:07:20 <Selfie_Dad> unbelievable busty babe in sex
00:07:31 <Selfie_Dad> lmao that pic
00:07:44 <ehn> lol
00:19:06 <alansmithee_> Selfie_Dad: 10lbs is what i'm at now
00:19:44 <alansmithee_> like  i think a bunch of the stuff i've been doing has been a bit too low and i've been raising some stuff (and lowering others tbh) 
00:19:50 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i mean thats par for the course for laterals
00:20:05 <Selfie_Dad> thats a small muscle group
00:20:07 <wild_ape-style_creature> i LOVE pud
00:20:11 <alansmithee_> but i basically started off with everything at about 15 lbs for the top exercises, and 12.5 on the bottom isos
00:20:24 <Selfie_Dad> its never gonna be something you do with like 35 lbs
00:20:38 <alansmithee_> but I WANNA do 35 lbs!
00:20:44 <Selfie_Dad> tough shit bitch
00:20:47 <alansmithee_> :( 
00:21:00 <wild_ape-style_creature> lat raises suck ass
00:21:01 <alansmithee_> but if thta's not unreasonable, i'll just leave it where it is then
00:21:14 <Selfie_Dad> i dont go above 20 on them and thats for like sets of 12-15
00:21:23 <scoop_jackson> WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS
00:21:25 <scoop_jackson> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/8Q0DFx7U/image.png
00:21:26 <alansmithee_> when i did stuff before it was mostly on machines so using free weight is different finding where i should be
00:21:43 <Selfie_Dad> those i prefer much higher reps with lower weight cause otherwise you're banging up your joints
00:21:48 <alansmithee_> ahh ok
00:22:16 <Selfie_Dad> i like 3x15-20 rep range for laterals with whatever weight feels comfortable in that range
00:22:17 <alansmithee_> like i'm super fat so working with small weights always feels weird like i should be movving way more just cause i'm fat and the ratio to body weight is tiny
00:22:44 <alansmithee_> yeah for me that would probably be like 5 lbs i'd guess, or maybe 7.5 but even that may be too much for that 
00:22:51 <Selfie_Dad> yeah but id be concerned about quality over quantity of rep first and foremost
00:23:08 <Selfie_Dad> try the lowest weight possible for like 20 reps
00:23:19 <Selfie_Dad> youll feel it by the end of the last set for sure
00:23:28 <alansmithee_> i'll cut the weight on my next go around then
00:23:34 <Selfie_Dad> and if you dont the  u can just bump it up next time
00:23:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmao dreddybajs 
00:24:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> check out this very good mtg ruling text on the card academy manufactor
00:24:14 <alansmithee_> sweet. i just don't know if i feel like i'm gaining much, or when i should be upping weight or w/e

00:34:38 <dreddybajs> very good
00:56:30 <dreddybajs> and yeah agree with will alansmithee_, quality is the important thing. its much better to start too low cause youll move up to where you should be fairly quickly. starting too high is a bad time
00:57:11 <dreddybajs> alansmithee_: if at the end of your sets (3x15 or whatever you're doing), if the last few reps don't feel quite challenging, the weight is too low, bring it up next time
00:57:14 <dreddybajs> by a small amount
01:00:29 <dreddybajs> antiracist_baby: 
01:00:32 <dreddybajs> are you here lmfao

14:35:54 <Rusty> me & the other dev are meeting with our project manager on Monday to discuss our frustrations / softly threaten to leave if they don't change some shit. hoping i can get my thoughts together by then & not get too emotional in the moment
14:36:00 <greatest_gamer> spoken like a white boy that is neither goated with the sauce nor busses it down sexual style
14:36:25 <Selfie_Dad> i have ascended to a plane beyond such trivial things
14:36:34 <greatest_gamer> jack harlow has set a new bar for white boy swag previously thought to be impossible
14:36:58 <Selfie_Dad> i still think post malone probably has more swag 
14:37:04 <greatest_gamer> he beat chet hanx at his own game cause chet has too much chaos energy
14:37:16 <Selfie_Dad> because he is incredibly popular despite looking like absolute dog shit at all times
14:37:38 <Selfie_Dad> harder to pull off than some pretty boy bullshit if u ask me
14:37:46 <greatest_gamer> post malone is cool he’s like if john zorn’s saxophone sounds were a person
14:37:56 <mpg> lol
14:38:01 <Nude_Riker> lol
14:38:15 <Nude_Riker> .q add mason <greatest_gamer> post malone is cool he’s like if john zorn’s saxophone sounds were a person
14:38:44 <greatest_gamer> back on the board
14:39:18 <Selfie_Dad> it rocks getting to actually get some use out of this mac mini
14:39:19 <greatest_gamer> Selfie_Dad: matt from chapo said jack harlow looks like a guy that won some kind of a contest
14:39:22 <Selfie_Dad> cant wait for my bigger screen

14:39:25 <Selfie_Dad> lmao he does
14:39:28 <greatest_gamer> yeah
14:39:31 <greatest_gamer> it’s stuck in my head now
14:39:37 <greatest_gamer> and makes me laugh pretty often
14:39:38 <Selfie_Dad> l;ol
14:39:48 <greatest_gamer> imagining him as like Nickelodeon’s Cool Guy 2022
14:39:53 <Selfie_Dad> make a wish foundation "little jack, what can we do for you?" "i wanna be a rapper!!!"
14:40:17 <greatest_gamer> ya he’s like those eastern european boy men with rickets
14:41:06 <Selfie_Dad> hm i should get a magic trackpad now i think
14:41:36 <greatest_gamer> in a way he did win a contest in the sense that he has what the machine needs to create another consumption totem
14:41:58 <mpg> magic trackpad works good but i have found using a trackpad on the desktop feels wrong
14:41:58 <Selfie_Dad> yeah g eazy's popularity was either waning or to regionally constricted
14:42:07 <Selfie_Dad> we needed a guy who could cross those boundaries
14:42:27 <Selfie_Dad> same w/ yelawolf, who is aging and too kid rocky 
14:42:31 <Selfie_Dad> at times
14:42:51 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i feel that mpg but i mostly want it for swiping between fullscreen apps and other desktops lol
14:42:58 <greatest_gamer> damn yelawolf i remember having that forced on me when i was compiling the pitchfork best new music lists on nmp3s
14:43:00 <mpg> you can swipe with the mouse
14:43:04 <Selfie_Dad> i realize that is a silly use case to pay 120 dollars or w/e for
14:43:06 <mpg> i do it constantly
14:43:16 <greatest_gamer> i want a magic everything
14:43:25 <mpg> simply become magical
14:43:39 <greatest_gamer> damn that’s a shortcut
14:44:00 <Selfie_Dad> maybe i could map one of these unused side buttons ion my mouse to do that
14:44:14 <mpg> oh i thought you had the magic mouse
14:44:22 <mpg> that one does swiping like the trackpad
14:44:32 <Selfie_Dad> no i just have a logitech mouse
14:44:47 <Selfie_Dad> i dont like the magic mouse rly
14:44:54 <mpg> tragic macpad
14:45:00 <Selfie_Dad> too small or something
14:45:28 <mpg> mine gets tons of use, i think i use every feature
14:45:48 <Melber> i really liked the gestures on the magic mouse but when my old one went to shit it wasn't worth the cost to get a new one
14:46:15 <Melber> also i dont like the full screen windows or whatever if im doing dual monitors
14:46:41 <mpg> i dont really use full screen windows but i do use virtual desktops
14:46:46 <greatest_gamer> i never use my imac or my magic mouse because i can’t use them on the couch
14:46:54 <Melber> give me your imac
14:46:57 <Melber> ill give it a good home

14:48:48 <the`shima> .gis pierre gasly
14:48:50 <Melber> mpg: well the good news is i think almost every f1 driver is pretty fuckin hot
14:48:56 <mpg> they're all rich too
14:48:59 <the`shima> thats not a good photo
14:49:13 <Selfie_Dad> lmao this logitech options app wants me to create an account

14:49:55 <the`shima> theres something 'wrong' with max verstappen
14:50:09 <greatest_gamer> he’s got dracula energy
14:50:12 <Selfie_Dad> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/km8g1tND/image.png
14:50:12 <the`shima> when he won the championship they asked him what he does in his spare time away from f1 to relax
14:50:13 <greatest_gamer> i will not explain further
14:50:17 <Selfie_Dad> love to be logged in to Options
14:50:22 <Melber> im really into ferrari coming back up
14:50:26 <the`shima> and he was like "i do sim racing. i hang out in discord with these guys and just put 120 hours in each preparing for virtual le mans"
14:50:31 <greatest_gamer> well dan just kinda explained it exactly
14:50:34 <greatest_gamer> dracula energy.
14:50:40 <Melber> well the`shima i would say a few things
14:50:43 <Melber> 1. he's german
14:50:51 <the`shima> hes dutch]
14:50:53 <mpg> well,
14:50:54 <the`shima> dutch belgian
14:51:06 <Melber> alright well i withdraw my previous point
14:51:15 <greatest_gamer> he’s prussian
14:51:21 <the`shima> i just dont think max actually thinks about anything else bar racing
14:51:37 <Melber> but that's a kind of dude for sure, the just like singularly focused on the thing they're really good at guy
14:51:53 <Melber> my sort of mentor in law school was like that

14:52:28 <mpg> time to play elden ring all day again
14:52:35 <Melber> max verstappen's playlist is just different engine notes
14:52:40 <the`shima> Q: Apart from driving a Formula 1 car, what is your favourite buzz? Max Verstappen: Don’t laugh: karting!
14:52:55 <the`shima> Q: Which film last made you cry? MV: Actually I am a comedy person. Laughing is my thing. Stupid funny movies. Movies that are so stupid that they are really funny! 
14:53:08 <the`shima> Q: Do you have any guilty pleasures? MV: I like fizzy drinks. 
14:53:12 <Melber> lol i wouldve thought for sure it was the senna biopics
14:53:15 <Melber> biopic
14:53:23 <Melber> not real enough for him id bet
14:53:26 <the`shima> Q: Do you collect anything? MV: No.
14:53:44 <Melber> he collects wins
14:54:09 <the`shima> Q: What should everyone try once in their lifetime? MV: That is different for everybody, I guess. For me it is to drive an F1 car. 
14:54:26 <Melber> lol
14:54:53 <the`shima> TR: What's your favourite type of music?
14:54:53 <the`shima> Max: "I would say Pop music. I don't really have a favourite song or band.
14:55:11 <Selfie_Dad> ok after installing 3 things i can now click back and forth between desktops.... ftw
14:55:13 <the`shima> TR: Are you passionate about videogames? What's your favourite genre?
14:55:13 <the`shima> Max: "Mainly racing games."
14:55:21 <the`shima> he's so fucking weird lol
14:55:41 <Melber> max verstappen's favorite noise is the waning doppler effect of lewis hamilton's engine
14:55:41 <Selfie_Dad> the fizzy drink guilty pleasure
14:55:50 <the`shima> TR: Do you have a girlfriend?
14:55:50 <the`shima> Max: "Yes! She also comes from a racing family."
14:55:55 <Selfie_Dad> lol shit i need to change my pants to deadlift
14:56:01 <Selfie_Dad> these joggers i got have like a nylon shell
14:56:11 <Selfie_Dad> and the knurling on the barbell feels like its gonna tear them to shreds
14:56:14 <Melber> it's very funny to me that red bull has the most serious man in the world racing for Serious Partier toto wolff
14:56:33 <the`shima> i really dont like toto wolff lol
14:56:51 <Melber> i have no opinion of him
14:57:19 <the`shima> hes kinda just a dickhead. tries to run the shot sand throws his toys out of the pram when things dont happen
14:57:33 <the`shima> christian horner for example is a prick but its just well known hes a prick
14:57:38 <the`shima> he plays up to it
14:57:54 <the`shima> toto is more like "I am an ethical good man" while being a total piece of shit lol
14:58:31 <Selfie_Dad> oh neat theres a feature where i can link my keyboard and mouse to do fn+movement for gestures
14:58:34 <Selfie_Dad> thats kinda cool
14:58:44 <the`shima> the race this weekend should be... interesting Melber
14:59:02 <the`shima> its a really stupid and dangerous track that the drivers kinda hate
14:59:14 <the`shima> like "oh you amde something good and challenging but its also very dangerous"
14:59:18 <Melber> i mean i would say every f1 race is pretty ethically dubious but yeah this is a very bad one
14:59:28 <Selfie_Dad> oh lmao there was a gesture button on this mouse the whole time
14:59:35 <the`shima> last years race there was the first time it had been raced on and it was... very eventufl
14:59:35 <Selfie_Dad> noob moment
14:59:45 <Melber> the miami grand prix is going to be very dubious as well
14:59:51 <Rusty> saibot
14:59:55 <the`shima> whats up with miami
15:00:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> im pretty sure the intern for our c3 does not do any work at all
15:00:08 <the`shima> all i hear about miami is that the hospitality is going to be amazing
15:00:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> hes been on like, one of our meetings ever
15:00:09 <Melber> oh you mean the Cypto.com Miami Grand Prix?
15:00:11 <the`shima> the track itself looks... meh
15:00:13 <the`shima> oh lol
15:00:19 <the`shima> ya all the teams are in with crypto now which sucks
15:00:25 <Melber> no dude
15:00:30 <Melber> MIAMI is in with crypto
15:00:51 <Melber> the mayor is like straight up shilling for all the crypto companies to headquarter there and giving them huge tax breaks and stuff
15:00:55 <the`shima> i think red bull got paid a bucketload of money by one of the crypto companies
15:00:58 <the`shima> oh jesus
15:01:09 <Melber> oh and he also heavily invested the city in an absolute dogshit crypto coin iirc
15:01:12 <Melber> .g miamicoin
15:01:17 <the`shima> red bull also got the biggest sponsorship deal on the track iirc
15:01:21 <the`shima> with Oracle lol
15:01:39 <Melber> damn the canadian track looks boring as shit
15:01:46 <Selfie_Dad> big ups to the intern tom
15:02:00 <the`shima> its not great
15:02:23 <Melber> is the US grand prix in austin again
15:02:23 <the`shima> canada has had some cool races. it somehow has this mythical status with some fans now even though its always been average as a track
15:02:26 <the`shima> yep
15:02:38 <Melber> hm
15:02:40 <the`shima> austin, miami, canada and mexico are the 4 north american races
15:02:46 <the`shima> next year they're looking to add las vegas
15:02:50 <Melber> i think lynz and i might be going to austin sometime in the next year
15:03:08 <Melber> she has to do some in person training down there
15:03:28 <Melber> & that's the week after my birthday

15:03:47 <the`shima> the best tracks imo are interlagos brazil, spa belgiun, monza italy, suzuka japan
15:04:01 <the`shima> the worst left on the calendar is probably france
15:04:24 <the`shima> hungary kinda sucks too imo
15:04:35 <the`shima> france is unbelievably shit though
15:04:49 <the`shima> bad racing, it looks absolutely atrocious, fans are non existent
15:07:17 <Melber> japan's looks cool, austria's is pretty weird
15:07:53 <Nude_Riker> the old monza was pretty sick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HA71tYl640
15:07:53 <the`shima> yeah austria has been good last few years actuallyt
15:08:13 <the`shima> japan is actually really really hard thats the thing too
15:08:30 <Nude_Riker> i really like doing monza 66 with open wheel cars in assetto corsa
15:08:31 <Selfie_Dad> lol just went to commit some script changes to db and entered 'commit ho' instead of 'commit go'
15:08:39 <Selfie_Dad> .gis commit ho
15:08:51 <Nude_Riker> lol
15:08:52 <Selfie_Dad> 0_0
15:09:39 <Nude_Riker> the single greatest racing circuit ever though isnt a track its the targa florio road race
15:09:40 <Selfie_Dad> .l
15:09:54 <Melber> that is a real asshole way to do a test
15:10:12 <Melber> perhaps bested only by the real jerk way they phrase things for the bar exam
15:10:17 <the`shima> the turn 10/turn 11 hairpin on suzuka is a fucking nightmare lol
15:10:29 <Nude_Riker> i really havent spent much time at suzuka
15:10:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> i tried to alt+f4 out of zoom to get out of this interminable meeting that i dont actually need to be in
15:10:35 <Nude_Riker> spa is thrilling though
15:10:37 <the`shima> do they have mugello on that game matt
15:10:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> and it autmoatically restarted and put me right back in
15:10:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> fuckers
15:10:42 <Nude_Riker> yeah the`shima 
15:10:43 <Melber> "select the best available answer"
15:11:00 <the`shima> nice
15:11:05 <the`shima> i wish they did another f1 race there
15:11:08 <the`shima> its so fucking good
15:11:22 <mikev> lol tom
15:11:35 <Nude_Riker> ive probably lapped laguna seca more than any other track, partially because it's so short so benchmarking is easy
15:11:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> i want to drop off the meeting and lie and say my internet is dead
15:12:03 <the`shima> im kinda mixed on laguna seca
15:12:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> so i can listen to the song hey man nice shot by filter
15:12:13 <Selfie_Dad> lol
15:12:16 <scoop_jackson> i always mix up type 1 and type 2 errors
15:12:17 <the`shima> it clearly rules as a track but theres so many types of races id never want to see on there
15:12:31 <the`shima> the motogp races they had on there were always nuts tho
15:12:46 <the`shima> dudes just battling on the corkscrew
15:12:57 <scoop_jackson> i heard that bar exams have some questions that are not the law in any state because they are weird composites or something like that
15:12:59 <Nude_Riker> yeah its definitely not the most exciting to watch for most because passing zones can be so throttled
15:13:16 <Nude_Riker> but i dont really watch racing so idc
15:13:40 <Melber> scoop_jackson: sort of but not really?
15:13:51 <the`shima> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-FD76BwB08
15:14:03 <Melber> i think the MBE tests based on restatements
15:14:25 <Melber> which are like big tomes of suggested laws that most states at least adopt significant portions of
15:14:33 <Melber> .gis restatemend second of torts
15:15:28 <Nude_Riker> the corkscrew is one of those things that i know i'll never get the full feeling from a game, games just dont do elevation right cause theres no stomach drop, but also pov is wrong
15:15:52 <Nude_Riker> like even with an accurate FOV on a laserscan of it you dont get a sense for how massive the drop is
15:16:22 <the`shima> ya thats why i dont like it much on the games
15:16:27 <the`shima> you cant get a camera that works
15:16:45 <Nude_Riker> i mean i only race from cockpit view ever
15:17:00 <Nude_Riker> well, occasionally bumper in some games
15:17:01 <the`shima> i do the windscreen cam on gt
15:17:12 <the`shima> so you can just see the bonnet of the car
15:17:17 <Nude_Riker> yeah
15:17:51 <Nude_Riker> in forza if im trying to get a hotlap down ill do front bumper cam because the cockpit view blocks too much

15:46:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> not going to lie i was surprised when i saw what g eazy looked like
15:46:37 <ajj2> white girls love (loved?) g eazy 
15:46:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> after having heard his music
15:46:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> he is a very handsome white man so that makes sense
15:46:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> white girls also love rap
15:47:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> lots of things white girls love there
15:47:32 <mikev> how is the diet going
15:47:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> pretty good
15:47:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> im down probably like 8 lbs in 3 weeks? 
15:48:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> give or take
15:48:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> not sure because i dont know what i started at
15:48:23 <the`shima> that is very good
15:48:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> but im pretty sure i started at like 215 and im weighing in at 207 now
15:48:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think my appetite is decreasing which is also good
15:50:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive more or less gotten used to food logging and it doesnt make me completely fucking miserable to do it anymore
15:52:08 <Selfie_Dad> yep ur getting past the acclimation period
15:52:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> im starting to get a better sense for what things are calorie dense and what things are not
15:52:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> some shit i thought was very unhealthy is much less so than i thought
15:53:02 <mikev> yeah you'll be cruising for a while now
15:53:09 <Selfie_Dad> yeah a lot of trial and error will get you to things that you like to eat and are filling
15:53:23 <Selfie_Dad> and meet your targets
15:53:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> my mom was always doing the marge simpson groan about food when i was growing up and every time i thought i was doing something healthy she would be like "no that stuff is bad for you"
15:54:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> like for example, drinking orange juice, which as a kid in the 90s seemed to be the healthiest thing that it was possible to do in the world
15:54:02 <Selfie_Dad> i mean no food is really all that bad for you in a vacuum 
15:54:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> but my mom was like "no that's full of sugar"
15:54:14 <Selfie_Dad> lol yeah they really sold everyone on juice in the 90s
15:54:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> but actually ive been putting it in my smoothies and it is not nearly as bad as i thought
15:54:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> like in terms of cals per gram it is way way way lower than a lot of stuff
15:54:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> like sure most of the calories are from sugar but who cares, you need that shit too
15:54:57 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i mean its sugary but if you're only using a bit per day its a drop in the bucke
15:55:07 <Selfie_Dad> and it makes all the other healthier stuff more palatable
15:55:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah im putting like 150-200 ml in a smoothie
15:55:14 <Selfie_Dad> which is important too
15:55:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> with a lot of frozen fruit, yogurt, protein powder
15:55:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> the yogurt is like 5x as calorie dense as the oj is
15:55:38 <mikev> classic
15:56:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> but yogurt is something my mom would say is healthy and oj was not healthy, according to her
15:56:36 <Selfie_Dad> yeah 
15:56:40 <Selfie_Dad> well yogurt is healthy
15:57:03 <Selfie_Dad> calorie dense things aren't necessarily healthy or not
15:57:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah i dont disagree 
15:57:23 <Selfie_Dad> unless theyre like 100% fat and then even those can be healthy if you need more of the healthy fats in your diet
15:57:31 <mikev> i end my night with a yogurt these days
15:57:38 <Selfie_Dad> yogurt rocks
15:57:47 <mikev> chobani has a bunc of good flavors
15:57:53 <Selfie_Dad> pro yogurt tip is the fage 0 or 2% fat
15:57:56 <mikev> that aren't just Strawberry, Blueberry, Vanilla
15:57:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> i like the stonyfield whole milk yogort
15:58:10 <mikev> i get skyr if they have it
15:58:16 <Selfie_Dad> fage greek is like miles better than the chobani imo
15:58:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> the whole milk ones generally are much nicer texturally than the fage 0% things to me
15:58:30 <Selfie_Dad> get the fage 2% its close to that
15:58:33 <Selfie_Dad> but way more protein
15:58:43 <Selfie_Dad> i get fage 2% plain and just mix stuff into that
15:58:44 <Nude_Riker> commercial yogurts arent fermented long enough thats my yogurt thought
15:58:51 <Nude_Riker> they need to process more of the sugar
15:59:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> thank you for your thoughts on Commercial Yogurts
15:59:10 <Selfie_Dad> i dont disagree but the fage 2% hits the sweet spot for me as far as taste texture and price
15:59:15 <Selfie_Dad> esp when im mixin it
15:59:22 <Selfie_Dad> mixes v good w/ 'tein poweder
15:59:44 <the`shima> god i was interviewing people in work yesterday for like 9 hours
15:59:53 <the`shima> my brain is custard today
15:59:57 <mikev> intervieiwng sucks
16:00:01 <Nude_Riker> the best yogurt i have found at stores is the white mountain bulgarian yogurt
16:00:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> the brown cow whole milk yogurt is my favorite
16:00:21 <Selfie_Dad> also the fage 2% is pretty good for subbing a portion of for mayo
16:00:25 <the`shima> hour long interviews with everyone then watching them in a simulated panel for a bit
16:00:31 <Selfie_Dad> to make a recipe healthier and less fatty
16:00:39 <Selfie_Dad> abd keeping texture
16:01:18 <Nude_Riker> brutal the`shima 
16:01:25 <mikev> lmao god an hour long itnerview
16:01:55 <Selfie_Dad> god that sucks
16:01:56 <Nude_Riker> hour long interview isnt too long its the rewatching thats nuts to me
16:01:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> well anyway sydney is going to get the fage 2% next time she goes to the store
16:02:11 <Selfie_Dad> its tastty
16:02:20 <the`shima> isnt there some debate about full fat dairy vs the skimmed stuff
16:02:26 <Nude_Riker> full fat dairy ftw
16:02:28 <Selfie_Dad> not really
16:02:34 <the`shima> that the full fat has more calories but fills you more and typically has less sugar
16:02:46 <Selfie_Dad> yeah in general thats the case
16:02:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> well anyway
16:02:50 <the`shima> i say this as a man who is vegan and has only heard people talk about it
16:02:50 <Nude_Riker> well yeah that is how they are composed
16:02:51 <Selfie_Dad> you can use less of it for any use case
16:02:53 <Nude_Riker> not a debate
16:03:09 <the`shima> yeah matt/mike - it was like 6 intense questions and the guy next to me was really picking guys apart on everything they said
16:03:12 <Selfie_Dad> like calorie for calorie you'd probably eat less of it because its more satiating
16:03:21 <Selfie_Dad> .l
16:03:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> my general smoothie strat has been about half frozen fruit by weight, about 75% of that yogurt, and then the rest orange juice, with one scoop of protein powder
16:03:35 <Nude_Riker> interesting, 6 questions over an hour?
16:03:36 <wild_ape-style_creature> the cert that expired this morning was the actual vmware cert
16:03:40 <wild_ape-style_creature> and not a secondary cert
16:03:41 <wild_ape-style_creature> ftw
16:03:42 <Nude_Riker> lol
16:03:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> and if im getting the greek yogurt i will also get fresh banana, which helps balance against the additional tartness of the greek yogurt
16:03:49 <Rusty> lol
16:04:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> we dont usually keep bananas around because sydney doesnt like them much and they go bad so fast
16:04:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i like them for smoothies
16:04:14 <Nude_Riker> try adding some additional fiber in the smoothie in the form of psyllium tom
16:04:15 <wild_ape-style_creature> stick your nanners in the freezer tom
16:04:16 <wild_ape-style_creature> that's what i do
16:04:22 <Nude_Riker> just to fill it out and make you more full
16:04:27 <wild_ape-style_creature> i freeze myt bananas and slice em up for smoothies
16:04:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> we have psyllium i was thinking about putting some in the smoothies
16:04:48 <Nude_Riker> also for good poops
16:04:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> i like the texture from blending a fresh banana but if ours are starting to go soft i will chop them up and freeze
16:05:01 <Selfie_Dad> well the fage isnt really all that tart compared to like chobani or the oikos greek yogurts
16:05:05 <Nude_Riker> just have to add extra water cause the psyll will soak up everything
16:05:09 <Selfie_Dad> so you probably wont need to use that much
16:05:12 <Selfie_Dad> but banana is yummy
16:05:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> really? i find it to be a lot more tart than the chobani
16:05:14 <wild_ape-style_creature> i like frozen banana more because it's just a fruit milkshake then
16:05:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> havent really had the oikos
16:05:23 <Selfie_Dad> have you been having the plain ones?
16:05:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
16:05:41 <Selfie_Dad> i think the chobani unquestionably has a more lactic tang than any of the fage
16:05:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> i already put a lot of frozen berry or w/e frut in the smoothies so they are already milkshakey
16:06:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> fresh banaba + frozen berry is nice for texture i think
16:06:20 <wild_ape-style_creature> frozen nanner + frozen berry is like a soft sorbet and i like it a lot
16:06:29 <Nude_Riker> yeah ive been having smoothie of fresh banana and frozen blueberry with psyll and chocolate collagen last few days
16:06:31 <Selfie_Dad> i get the chobani as backup when fage is sold out or we so i eat em both pretty regularly
16:06:39 <Selfie_Dad> why collagen
16:06:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> i like being able to drink the smooties with a straw too
16:06:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> that is important to me
16:06:47 <wild_ape-style_creature> banana + blueberry + pb is epic
16:06:55 <wild_ape-style_creature> i eat them out of a bowl with a spoon
16:06:58 <Selfie_Dad> yeah smoothy cant be like ice cream thick imo
16:07:08 <Selfie_Dad> thats just pudding
16:07:12 <Nude_Riker> because i have it around Selfie_Dad, its funny to do because it's branded "Keto Collagen" and stevia sweetened, but im mixing with fruit
16:07:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> i didnt realize how insanely calorie dense pb is until the other day
16:07:15 <wild_ape-style_creature> i don't like a runny smoothie
16:07:19 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah it is
16:07:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> or i guess like last week
16:07:30 <wild_ape-style_creature> if you want pb flavor without all the cals you can buy pb powder
16:07:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> when i was already running up against my cal limit and i was like what can i have thats not much but will tide me over. oh a peanut butter sandwich
16:07:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh wait a tablespoon of pb is fucking 275 calories
16:08:30 <Selfie_Dad> yeah theres pb2
16:08:38 <Selfie_Dad> which can scratch the itch when mixed with other stuff
16:08:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> we have this protein powder https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/IsI0gH7Z/image.png
16:08:42 <wild_ape-style_creature> it's good in smoothies but it's weird on its own
16:08:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> this stuff doesnt taste like anything
16:08:51 <Selfie_Dad> lol wait a table spoon of pb should not be 275 calories
16:08:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> which is fine 
16:08:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> well its jif if that helps
16:08:59 <Selfie_Dad> unless its rly sugary s
16:09:00 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah i assumed it was an exaggeration
16:09:00 <Selfie_Dad> oh
16:09:01 <Selfie_Dad> lol
16:09:01 <Nude_Riker> oh yeah lol
16:09:06 <bonegar> .g peanut butter flavored gun
16:09:13 <bonegar> .g peanut butter flavored gum
16:09:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> wait a tbsp of jif REALLY 275 cals
16:09:14 <wild_ape-style_creature> wtf
16:09:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> i might be slightly exaggerating but im pretty sure its over 250
16:09:18 <Selfie_Dad> yeah like the non sugar pbs are like 180 cal/2 tbsp
16:09:18 <Nude_Riker> peanut butter that is just peanuts is not nearly that
16:09:33 <Nude_Riker> the jif probably has other oil in there too right
16:09:36 <wild_ape-style_creature> jif is relly gross
16:09:37 <Selfie_Dad> probably
16:09:38 <Selfie_Dad> palm oil
16:09:40 <wild_ape-style_creature> really*
16:09:40 <bonegar> pb is very highly caloric
16:09:53 <wild_ape-style_creature> .g calories in jif
16:09:55 <Nude_Riker> whenever i look at "normal" peanut butter at the store im like what is going on here
16:10:06 <Nude_Riker> why cant i just buy. peanut butter
16:10:11 <Selfie_Dad> im looking in macrofactor and regular creamy jif is 190 cals for 2 tbsp
16:10:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh that serving size is 2 tbsp
16:10:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> i thought it was 1
16:10:24 <Selfie_Dad> yeah pb is usually 2 tbsp
16:10:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> well i guess thats a little less crazy than i thought but still
16:10:31 <Selfie_Dad> on the labeling
16:10:36 <Rusty> you guys know a lot about "palm oil" i bet
16:10:41 <Selfie_Dad> welp, time for 40+ deadlifts
16:10:44 <Nude_Riker> good one rusty
16:10:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> 2 tbsp of peanut butter being the same as a fairly large chicken breast is wild
16:10:46 <bonegar> 2 tbsp will absolutely cover an entire tortilla or bread
16:10:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> to me
16:11:55 <bonegar> yea PB is really efficient
16:12:06 <wild_ape-style_creature> i love pb
16:12:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah thats why its always in MREs
16:12:08 <bonegar> lots of oil stuff is going to be like that i think
16:12:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> it also stays good forever
16:12:17 <Selfie_Dad> its a good massing tool
16:12:27 <Selfie_Dad> pretzel and pb diet
16:12:31 <wild_ape-style_creature> ^^^^
16:12:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> [steve voice] Wow. That tastes like..... some 75 year old..... peanut butter. Wow
16:12:47 <Melber> fucking aldi had toffee covered pretzels right at the aisle
16:12:48 <wild_ape-style_creature> lmao
16:12:49 <Rusty> (finishing up a strenuous workout) it's peanut butter jelly time
16:12:52 <Melber> absolutely sniped me
16:12:55 <bonegar> pb is a great utility player for me... especially on days i can't work up the energy to eat properly
16:13:02 <Selfie_Dad> damn that sounds awesome Melber 
16:13:10 <Selfie_Dad> i still havent been to our aldi
16:13:17 <Melber> ill let you know in probably like an hour or two
16:13:26 <Melber> i was pretty into putting that powdered pb into yogurt for a while
16:14:13 <HellaBrad> pb is an all-time great ingredient. good in sauces, good in desserts, good as just a snack
16:14:55 <HellaBrad> have never tried peanut butter on a fresh pretzel but i want to now
16:15:04 <Selfie_Dad> 10 deadlifts down
16:15:08 <Selfie_Dad> 30+ to go
16:15:20 <HellaBrad> good work
16:15:27 <Melber> i mean on a hot soft pretzel pb is probably gonna slide right off
16:15:42 <Selfie_Dad> light weight only 210 today
16:15:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> if the pb is also warm it will probably be ok
16:15:52 <Selfie_Dad> still taxing as hell cardiovascularly
16:15:52 <Nude_Riker> i mostly use peanut butter for making sauce
16:16:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> mustard is the best thing to put on a hot pretzel
16:16:01 <HellaBrad> yeah i was thinking like dipping in some warmed organic kirkland stuff
16:16:30 <HellaBrad> i have a couple of really good mustards for pretzels tho, thats my main situation when i make them
16:16:38 <the`shima> im watching RLM review of picard season 2
16:16:44 <the`shima> this is possibly even stupider than last year
16:16:46 <Melber> mustard or beer cheese
16:16:48 <ajj2> Dog abandoned for being ‘gay’ gets adopted by a gay couple
16:16:49 <ajj2> lol
16:16:54 <ajj2> I love my gay dog.
16:16:59 <Melber> i had a gay dog
16:17:05 <HellaBrad> dont talk to me or my gay dog ever again
16:17:23 <Melber> insofar as he seemed to really enjoy humping my other male dog
16:17:36 <Selfie_Dad> gay dog redemption
16:17:36 <wild_ape-style_creature> all dogs are gay
16:17:38 <ajj2> lol
16:17:44 <Selfie_Dad> 2
16:18:00 <Rusty> all dogs are gay in the park, is the full idiom i think
16:18:04 <ajj2> lol
16:18:13 <Melber> is that about like prison or something
16:19:56 <HellaBrad> pretty pleasant metaphorical imagery for prison, a friendly dog park
16:20:11 <Selfie_Dad> 10 more deadlift on the board
16:21:03 <Melber> i want to get this for my house but i have nowhere for it https://www.amazon.com/Crosley-Furniture-Everett-Media-Console/dp/B01A93XWBQ/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=MxJIX&pf_rd_p=a654ad73-af1c-40d7-8dbb-00cce9c459f1&pf_rd_r=QFJT37Y4CXAG0141WVD3&pd_rd_r=6e38d2fa-16ee-42bd-b59d-9288d00bd950&pd_rd_wg=n0dgB&ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_atf_m&th=1
16:21:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> know what people dont talk about enough is mf doom's part in the show perfect hair forever
16:21:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> why dont people talk about that more
16:21:31 <ajj2> rofl
16:21:35 <ajj2> i dont think many people remember perfect hair forever
16:21:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_0DCDnRm0M
16:21:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> perfect hair forever ftw
16:21:55 <Selfie_Dad> i only ever saw the first episode that was a prank
16:22:04 <Selfie_Dad> and had the space ghost roundtable afterwards
16:22:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> "How abouts you fly down to Apalachicola and pick us up a cooler of fresh fish. Some scrod." - MF Doom
16:22:37 <Melber> no tartar
16:23:19 <wild_ape-style_creature> i remember perfect hair forever
16:23:25 <wild_ape-style_creature> boy what a ref
16:23:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> i used to say "swordfish is good" a lot with my friends c. 2009
16:23:49 <bonegar> the food?
16:23:53 <bonegar> or the movie
16:23:55 <ajj2> lol
16:23:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> it is a quote from the above video
16:23:57 <bonegar> or the animal
16:24:01 <bonegar> oh
16:24:07 <Selfie_Dad> the food is the animal innit
16:24:08 <bonegar> i clicked on the video but it was too hard to watch
16:24:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> it is said by a giraffe played by mf doom after another character's hand is severed
16:24:12 <Nude_Riker> i would say that about the movie in 2009
16:24:24 <bonegar> i think liking the animal and liking to eat the animal are different
16:24:25 <bonegar> but complex
16:24:31 <ajj2> i should rewatch xavier renegade angel again
16:24:40 <bonegar> ive never seen the movie
16:24:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> perfect hair forever deserves a critical revival
16:24:43 <bonegar> i wonder if i should
16:25:13 <bonegar> sounds like you have a calling from god to do this
16:25:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> i remember it being a big deal that halle berry's boobs were seen in swordfish
16:25:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> a lot of excitement about that
16:25:42 <bonegar> lol
16:25:51 <Melber> yes
16:25:58 <bonegar> i only know john travolta was in it, i didn't know about the boobs
16:26:00 <Melber> that was the primary sale of the movie as i remember it
16:26:03 <bonegar> and maybe a guy who is short
16:26:04 <Selfie_Dad> xavier ftw
16:26:05 <Melber> it also had hugh jackman in it
16:26:12 <Selfie_Dad> yeah also monsters ball
16:26:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> huge jack man
16:26:24 <Selfie_Dad> thats me
16:26:45 <Selfie_Dad> thats 10 more deadlifts for the people keeping track at home
16:26:51 <ajj2> huge jack man's monster balls
16:26:59 <Selfie_Dad> lol
16:27:02 <bonegar> i never watched much adult swim growing up because late at night i thought watching cspan senate hearings was way funnier... so i definitely missed out on a lot
16:27:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> it owned that melt-banana did a song for perfect hair forever
16:27:11 <bonegar> smdh at teen bonegar
16:27:18 <ajj2> lol
16:27:21 <Selfie_Dad> did u watch Book TV bonegar
16:27:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dl2dlZyoX4
16:27:26 <bonegar> you know it
16:27:28 <ajj2> i didnt get into most adult swim stuff until way later 
16:27:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> hamburger
16:27:30 <bonegar> i loved book t.v so much
16:27:37 <ajj2> like i was out here in 2020 going bro yall heard of this space ghost guy??
16:27:42 <wild_ape-style_creature> lfmao
16:27:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> i was extremely into adult swim at the exact second that it first existing
16:27:54 <wild_ape-style_creature> i have not ajj who is he
16:27:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> i was in 7th grade and it was the perfect time for that sort of thing, for me
16:27:58 <bonegar> deep memories of boring ladies with bowl cuts and laughing my ass off on zero drugs at 2 am playing final fantasy 7 through 9
16:28:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i also liked space ghost before that
16:28:10 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah tom
16:28:17 <bonegar> yea i would watch space ghost 
16:28:21 <bonegar> i guess that's the only one 
16:28:25 <Selfie_Dad> i watched it pretty regularly from the beginning of athf and sealab era
16:28:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> its funny how adult swim and 9/11 happened at right about the same time
16:28:31 <bonegar> i didn't like aqua teen hunger force because i thought they were mean
16:28:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> its true they were
16:28:40 <Melber> i watched all of those original ones
16:28:41 <ajj2> sealab kicks ass 
16:28:51 <bonegar> sealab was too zany for me
16:28:52 <Selfie_Dad> and then i watched t&e when that came on but i didnt keep up with anything else
16:28:52 <ajj2> wtf they're way more mean in sealab than athf though lol
16:28:55 <Melber> mingus dew
16:29:04 <bonegar> yea i wasnt into sealab either lol
16:29:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think sealab is very hit or miss in hindsight
16:29:17 <ajj2> what abouat harvey birdman
16:29:19 <Melber> i fell off adult swim pretty hard when they started doing like
16:29:21 <Melber> the brak show
16:29:21 <Selfie_Dad> .y do you want the mustache on or off
16:29:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> but the first 3 seasons of athf are still really good
16:29:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> first season of harvey birdman was extremely good
16:29:40 <Nude_Riker> sealab kicked ass 30% of the time
16:29:42 <Nude_Riker> maybe 40%
16:29:44 <Selfie_Dad> the brak show is kinda funny but also, very annoying
16:29:45 <Selfie_Dad> lol
16:29:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> did that inspire you to be an attorney melber
16:29:50 <ajj2> lol
16:29:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah Selfie_Dad 
16:29:56 <ajj2> agreed re: brak show
16:29:56 <bonegar> i think i would have liked tim and eric more if they never involved other people and just played with their synths and dated editing equipment more
16:30:02 <ajj2> i still go back and watch home movies a lot
16:30:05 <Nude_Riker> when sealab was really kicking ass it really kicked ass, but when it sucked it really sucked
16:30:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> i was not into tgttm or tim and eric at all in the beginning
16:30:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> too much Gross Stuff for me
16:30:15 <Melber> lol weird i didnt realize they did seasons of 12 oz mouse in 2018 and 2020
16:30:26 <Selfie_Dad> tgttm i wasnt high on but i loved t&e from the beginning
16:30:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> i like tim and eric a lot now though
16:31:04 <Melber> i also forgot MDE had a fuckin show on adult swim
16:31:04 <wild_ape-style_creature> i watched the original cartoons and then when i watched the reworked ones on adult swim i was confused
16:31:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> tim and eric was kind of made for the youtube era. just watching your fav clips
16:31:08 <bonegar> getting deep tv memories now
16:31:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> the mde show was very short lived, and was not funny at all
16:31:18 <wild_ape-style_creature> i didn'tcare too much for adult swim space ghost but i really liked sealab
16:31:44 <ajj2> yeah i saw way more tim and eric sketches on youtube before te show
16:31:44 <bonegar> space ghost, book t.v, Tia Carrere's Relic Hunter
16:31:46 <Melber> oh and obviously i watched a ton of venture bros
16:31:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> the best episodes of space ghost coast to coast are probably the funniest things that have ever been on tv
16:31:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> to me
16:31:54 <wild_ape-style_creature> as a teen i saw tim and eric live
16:31:56 <bonegar> they would always show those weird syndicated shows
16:32:02 <bonegar> like the mortal combat show and relic hunter super late
16:32:05 <wild_ape-style_creature> and i got pulled on stage and i wanted to die
16:32:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
16:32:15 <ajj2> rofl
16:32:19 <wild_ape-style_creature> i did not WANT to participate in the sketch
16:32:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> kentucky nightmare, knifin around, and flipmode are maybe the 3 funniest episodes of any show, ever
16:32:34 <Selfie_Dad> lol
16:32:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> wheres buster
16:32:49 <ajj2> were you surprised that eric wareheim is like shoot 6'7'' 
16:32:49 <Melber> i liked when adult swim would pick up shows that did not work out on network television
16:32:53 <bonegar> moby on spaceghost and being like me a literal child: 'i know who moby is this is very funny. they are getting his ass.'
16:33:04 <Selfie_Dad> i think its pretty apparent from seeing him on tv that eric is very tall
16:33:11 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah he's massive
16:33:13 <Melber> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFkafZZOqEQ&ab_channel=BenJohnson 
16:33:16 <Selfie_Dad> thats 13 more deadlifts for the folks at home
16:33:21 <Selfie_Dad> grand total comesout to 43
16:33:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> i worked some adult swim party at terminal 5 once, and when it ended everyone was stuck in the hallway leading out and eric wareheim was in there and he kept hollering "IM GONNA DRINK A BUD LIGHT!!!"
16:33:39 <bonegar> that was a good show melber, it was actually animated pretty well
16:33:51 <ajj2> rofl
16:33:55 <Melber> oh i think mission hill was great
16:34:02 <Selfie_Dad> lol tom
16:34:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> mission hill was great 
16:34:10 <wild_ape-style_creature> when i got pulled up we had to do a charades game where the goal was to guess the right songs
16:34:11 <bonegar> yea i remember enjoying it
16:34:11 <ajj2> mission hill rules
16:34:16 <dreddybajs> lol
16:34:19 <dreddybajs> eric ftw
16:34:19 <wild_ape-style_creature> and i was told to act out sit on you
16:34:26 <Melber> it was a bill oakley show of course it ruled
16:34:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> of the shows that were brought over to adult swim from elsewhere home movies is the obvious best and mission hill is second
16:34:36 <wild_ape-style_creature> it was so awful i'm embarrassed just thinking about it
16:34:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> home movies the most consistent adult swim show easily
16:34:52 <Selfie_Dad> ive never seen misson hill
16:34:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> youd like mission hill
16:35:01 <Selfie_Dad> yeah
16:35:03 <dreddybajs> mission bill
16:35:04 <Selfie_Dad> pobably
16:35:05 <wild_ape-style_creature> i vaguely remember that show
16:35:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
16:35:08 <Selfie_Dad> will jokely
16:35:16 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm sure i watched it
16:35:23 <bonegar> home movies was very nice to listen to while doing fun things on the computer
16:35:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> Selfie_Dad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHaI3dF8tl4
16:35:28 <Melber> was home movies an adult swim original or did they adopt it
16:35:34 <bonegar> good background show, because all the voices were good and you only ever needed to just glance at the tv
16:35:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> Melber: home movies was originally on upn, they adopted it from there after it was cancelled
16:35:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> but then they started making their own episodes
16:36:04 <Selfie_Dad> time for 45+ inclune benched press
16:36:05 <Melber> man UPN
16:36:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think it was only 1, maybe 2 seasons that existed before they brought it over
16:36:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> they also brought over Baby Blues, which was completely terrible
16:36:21 <scoop_jackson> I love about half the episodes in the first season of sealab
16:36:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think they made any new epsidoes of that
16:36:29 <Melber> according to wikipedia they also brought over the PJs
16:36:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol really
16:36:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> i do not recall that being on adult swim ever
16:36:38 <Selfie_Dad> lmao i remember baby blues
16:36:47 <Melber> baby blues is STILL a newspaper comic
16:36:49 <bonegar> lol
16:36:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> im sure it is
16:36:53 <bonegar> i remember reading the newspaper comic
16:36:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> those things never fucking die
16:36:57 <Melber> that baby fuckin grown up by now if you ask me
16:37:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> they have simpson disease
16:37:23 <Melber> the best newspaper comic is spiderman
16:37:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> Selfie_Dad: if you click that clip you will see a scene from mission hill where they had couldnt you wait in the bg
16:37:30 <bonegar> at least the funky winkerbeans guys all grew up, got goatees and became depresssed adults
16:38:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> mission hill is very much of the 90s milieu where cool hipster guys liked indie rock and also ska
16:38:13 <Melber> i remember being a pretty little kid and being very excited about going up to new york because they had the spiderman comic up there, reading one from like a friday that was three panels where nothing happened, and being like "why does anyone like spiderman this SUCKS"
16:38:14 <bonegar> i was a big newspaper comics child, just like.. getting weirdly excited to read prince valiant because my mom said my dad liked it once
16:38:15 <Selfie_Dad> lol cool
16:38:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> weird cultural zone
16:38:20 <Selfie_Dad> i will click it when im done pumpin
16:38:23 <Selfie_Dad> pumpers gotta pump
16:38:24 <bonegar> never understood a damn thing prince valiant was up to
16:38:25 <Melber> cake did the theme song for mission hill
16:38:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> yes they did
16:38:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> bonegar i liked the newspaper comics as a child too
16:38:32 <Melber> i feel like that tells you a lot
16:38:47 <bonegar> my genuine love for heathcliff remains
16:38:50 <Melber> i liked garfield a fair amount but the only newspaper comic i loved as a kid was the far side
16:38:53 <bonegar> thanks to newspaper comics
16:38:57 <Melber> but man i fucking LOVED the far side
16:39:01 <bonegar> lmao
16:39:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> i remember when they started printing boondocks in the newspaper when i was a kid and even back then only understanding a little bit of it i was like 'this seems a bit heavy for the newspaper'
16:39:07 <bonegar> melber did you have those daily calendars
16:39:07 <ajj2> i was really into fox trot cause there's like a 6 week arc about jason learning how to play myst
16:39:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> i had several far side books when i was a kid
16:39:12 <Selfie_Dad> yeah id check out far side and garfield books from the librayr
16:39:13 <bonegar> farside was HUGE out here
16:39:14 <bonegar> because of the cows
16:39:22 <wild_ape-style_creature> lmao ajj
16:39:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> foxtrot was pretty good as newspaper comics go
16:39:23 <wild_ape-style_creature> that's cool
16:39:24 <Melber> of course i did bonegar i had a fuckin far side tshirt i found at goodwill
16:39:30 <bonegar> hell yes
16:39:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> cow tools
16:39:34 <Selfie_Dad> .seen cow_tools
16:39:38 <ajj2> the far side and calvin and hobbes collections were ftw
16:39:43 <bonegar> the one i always remember
16:39:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> i never got into calvin and hobbes
16:39:46 <Melber> let my cousin wear it after he ruined his shirt in the stream and he fucking LOST IT
16:39:49 <Melber> asshole
16:39:50 <bonegar> is 'wet behind the ears mad scientist'
16:40:10 <Selfie_Dad> the other cartoonist i read a lot of because my grandfather had all his books
16:40:13 <Selfie_Dad> was b. kliban
16:40:14 <Selfie_Dad> lol
16:40:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> i remember the first boondocks strip i read having a free mumia joke in it
16:40:22 <bonegar> and i would think about it for days like when you give birth to someone, the child's ears don't get dry for awhile because they just came out of your womb, and so it is a crazy way to say someone is young
16:40:23 <Melber> bonegar: this is the tshirt i had: https://fifetli.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/screen-shot-2019-01-15-at-8.26.48-am.png
16:40:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> which i did not understand at all
16:40:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> so i had to look it up, which was harder to do at the time
16:40:33 <Selfie_Dad> anyone ever seen b kliban shit
16:40:37 <bonegar> lmao classic, melber
16:40:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> that was probably one of the first seeds of being a communist i had planted in me, come to think of it
16:40:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
16:40:52 <Rusty> foxtrot was a staple in our house too
16:40:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> thank you aaron mcgruder
16:41:04 <ajj2> foxtrot ftmfw
16:41:04 <HellaBrad> i read a lot of farside and also calvin and hobbes
16:41:06 <ajj2> Homie_in_a_geod i had a similar experience with doonesbury
16:41:16 <Melber> we didnt have foxtrot in the paper here til i was in like high school
16:41:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> doonesbury i always just shrugged off as 'boring shit for old people'
16:41:22 <Rusty> i miss my far side shirt. "Bummer of a birthmark, Hal"
16:41:24 <ajj2> lol
16:41:25 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah i read doonesbury as a child but didn't really like it 
16:41:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> i didnt understand any of the jokes
16:41:30 <wild_ape-style_creature> because yeah, it was boring shit for old people
16:41:33 <Melber> lol rusty that comic rules
16:41:36 <wild_ape-style_creature> but it was in the comics section so i still read it
16:41:42 <dreddybajs> i learned about mumia the regular way, through rage against the machine
16:41:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> 'whys this asterisk in a roman helmet talking at a podium. this is fucking stupid'
16:41:45 <Rusty> bloom county was the opposite for me, where i didn't get the references as a child but still laughed at shit
16:41:46 <bonegar> yea doonesbury was like... vietnam guy who watches westwing to me
16:41:48 <Melber> i bet i can remember a majority of far side comics just from the text
16:41:51 <wild_ape-style_creature> lmao tom
16:41:52 <bonegar> never cared about it
16:42:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> my parents loved Zits
16:42:04 <ajj2> the comics i really hated were for better or for worse and haggis the horrible
16:42:05 <HellaBrad> im pretty sure doonesbury was like the gateway into becoming politically aware for one of my friends in like fourth grade
16:42:11 <Rusty> someday i'll finish Tanner 88 maybe, but probably not
16:42:12 <wild_ape-style_creature> lmfao
16:42:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> because they thought i was like the kid in zits (ie, lazy)
16:42:17 <ajj2> lol
16:42:19 <bonegar> i never understood cathy's problems either
16:42:23 <wild_ape-style_creature> ack!
16:42:27 <Melber> you know what's a pretty good comic, or at least was: get fuzzy
16:42:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> cathys problems are pretty easy to understand imo
16:42:31 <bonegar> i distinctly remember my mother making fun of cathy 
16:42:36 <bonegar> so i was pretty anti-cathy
16:42:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> you accidentally eat whole pint of ice cream and now your fat. ack
16:42:43 <HellaBrad> hagar the horrible was my dad's favorite newspaper comic
16:42:45 <ajj2> i read Zits when i was like 10 and it was how i thought all teenagers were
16:42:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> i understand that completely
16:42:51 <HellaBrad> he would clip that one out and keep it on the fridge lmao
16:42:51 <wild_ape-style_creature> lmao ajj
16:42:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> all teenagers are actually like that
16:43:09 <Melber> is anyone here's dad really into BC
16:43:10 <ajj2> Zits and Fox Trot were basicall all i knew about how high school worked when i was like 10 and it was Very Alarming 
16:43:11 <wild_ape-style_creature> now that you're a teenager how do you feel about it
16:43:15 <ajj2> lol
16:43:19 <ajj2> its very accurate 
16:43:20 <bonegar> calvin and hobbes was the big draw for me
16:43:21 <Selfie_Dad> https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41C5LeXcxEL._SY311_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg
16:43:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> my grandma is the only person ive ever met who likes for better or for worse
16:43:44 <ajj2> ll
16:43:46 <bonegar> lol
16:43:50 <ajj2> it seems so bitter and mean spirited 
16:43:53 <eric> I liked foxtrot for a time 
16:44:01 <eric> I had a few collection books
16:44:02 <bonegar> for better and worse is like extremely candian-lutheran
16:44:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> that comic still running strictly for my grandmas benefit
16:44:05 <dreddybajs> im a peanuts guy
16:44:05 <bonegar> in my mind
16:44:07 <bonegar> or
16:44:19 <bonegar> i would read that one a lot too but i never quite understood it
16:44:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> what other comics were there
16:44:28 <Selfie_Dad> lol i remember this one from a kid
16:44:29 <Selfie_Dad> https://www.lambiek.net/artists/image/k/kliban/kliban_men.gif
16:44:30 <bonegar> family circus of course
16:44:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> pickles. that one was pretty funny. old people are old lmao
16:44:34 <dreddybajs> the one with the dog
16:44:36 <bonegar> the boringest comic
16:44:41 <ajj2> i liked baby blues
16:44:44 <dreddybajs> Marmaduke
16:45:03 <bonegar> i miss newspaper comics, rip newspapers
16:45:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> there was one called Herb & Jamaal which was extremely transparently "we need to run a boring comic for black people in our newspaper"
16:45:18 <ajj2> rofl
16:45:21 <ajj2> theres also uhh Sally Forth
16:45:34 <eric> Some of The comics in the local newspapers are mystifyingly bad
16:45:35 <ajj2> Luann
16:45:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> there were a couple of those soap opera strips that ran when i was a kid but i think they both went away eventually
16:45:47 <ajj2> Bettle Bailey 
16:45:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> brenda starr reporter and uh
16:45:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> apartment 2a?
16:45:55 <bonegar> my parents like Luann
16:45:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> or 2b
16:46:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont remember the apartment number now
16:46:02 <eric> Rex Morgan md
16:46:04 <bonegar> and i do not want to know why
16:46:08 <eric> Prince valiant
16:46:11 <bonegar> didn't someone do a big rex morgan deep dive
16:46:37 <eric> Such a funny idea for a comic just two lines of dialogue each week
16:46:47 <bonegar> dilbert doesn't deserve a mention
16:47:01 <eric> Absolutely impossible to know what's going on
16:47:04 <ajj2> pearls before swine is alright
16:47:08 <bonegar> i could never figure out wtf prince valiant was up to
16:47:27 <Rusty> i need to catch up on Heathcliff, i mostly just see it via people's tweets lately
16:47:32 <ajj2> sherman's lagoon and beetle bailey blow chunks
16:47:49 <bonegar> cliff is just like... you see a gag and you know and it's great
16:48:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> i found dilbert pretty funny when i was a kid
16:48:30 <ajj2> dilbert had funny moments before scott's brain completely broke in 2016
16:48:30 <eric> Me too
16:48:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/BjefeQ6i/image.png
16:48:38 <bonegar> lmao
16:48:39 <ajj2> lol
16:48:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> heathcliff is absolutely perfect
16:48:47 <Rusty> i loved Dilbert as a kid. which is weird for many reasons 
16:48:52 <bonegar> <Homie_in_a_geod> heathcliff is absolutely perfect
16:48:54 <Melber> Rex Morgan, M.D.

16:49:06 <Melber> i love those soap opera comics
16:49:19 <ajj2> probably
16:49:29 <Rusty> i think i enjoyed smug-nerd media. "My boss is an IDIOT. and so is EVERYONE ELSE"
16:49:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/YaN6NayD/image.png
16:49:40 <bonegar> never got into dilb
16:49:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> me too rusty
16:49:46 <wild_ape-style_creature> MEAT
16:49:58 <Nude_Riker> i had a couple of dilbert books someone gave me
16:50:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think its saying something about dilbert that those comics were funny to 8 year olds who obviously had no idea about anything regarding office culture
16:50:09 <Nude_Riker> i thought it was funny enough
16:50:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> probably not a good thing
16:50:16 <Rusty> lol
16:50:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> then again i also loved the movie office space at that time
16:50:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> which is still great
16:50:44 <eric> The dilber tv show was good
16:50:44 <Nude_Riker> i had not seen office space when i was a small child with dilbert comics
16:50:51 <Nude_Riker> the idea of offices was very abstract to me
16:51:04 <ajj2> theres also hit tv show, The Office
16:51:08 <Rusty> the dilbert show having a song from Forbidden Zone as the theme song was wild
16:51:31 <Selfie_Dad> he's back
16:51:41 <Nude_Riker> ajj2, that didnt exist yet
16:51:51 <ajj2> it did when i was a kid
16:52:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> dilber
16:52:02 <Rusty> ._.
16:52:18 <ajj2> i think about this more often than dilbert itself https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9xfqMtkmN0
16:52:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> i want to watch office space now
16:52:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> its so good
16:53:04 <Selfie_Dad> yeah
16:53:07 <Rusty> mike judge rarely misses
16:53:17 <Selfie_Dad> is it still playing 24h a day on comedy central
16:53:20 <Rusty> lol
16:53:25 <Selfie_Dad> or have we moved past that now
16:53:26 <ajj2> i believe so
16:53:31 <Rusty> between ferris bueller and half baked
16:53:39 <Selfie_Dad> .l
16:53:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> mike judges main miss was The Good Family
16:53:41 <Rusty> and for a while, rushmore(?)
16:53:42 <Selfie_Dad> dold
16:53:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> or whatever that show was called
16:53:49 <Selfie_Dad> goode
16:53:50 <Selfie_Dad> but yeah
16:53:56 <Selfie_Dad> that sucked ass
16:54:07 <ajj2> the goode show lol
16:54:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6wqHnXwQ1Y
16:54:35 <ajj2> actually it looks like comedy central's programming is about 70% south park re-runs with a mix of cleveland show, seinfeld, and the office re-runs
16:54:36 <ajj2> truly dire
16:54:41 <Rusty> oof
16:55:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> none of the vinyel me please represses they announced today were good
16:55:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> no young thug or juvenile. pathetic
16:55:37 <Selfie_Dad> wat ar they
16:55:43 <scoop_jackson> Bloom county taught me politics
16:55:56 <wild_ape-style_creature> oh i forgot about that one
16:56:05 <Rusty> it was so good
16:57:00 <wild_ape-style_creature> i just remember the penguin
16:57:14 <Rusty> name another newspaper comic that put a flexi single in a compilation book
16:58:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> Selfie_Dad: a bunch of crap i dont give a shit about

17:08:20 <bonegar> .yt neil young trans
17:08:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> computer age ftw
17:08:33 <bonegar> ^
17:09:17 <the`shima> imagining somebody who is sincerely like "hey guys im trans. ive been working on my new voice *links to vocaroo*" and its just a really bad neil young impersonation
17:09:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmfao
17:09:52 <dreddybajs> they turned the weans against him
17:10:17 <dreddybajs> lmao he's completely cracked the`shima 
17:10:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> wrote this poem about my transition https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/gyCnWmXc/image.png
17:10:36 <the`shima> lol
17:10:56 <the`shima> dreddybajs ireland has a lot of explaining to do. all your cultural exports who got big in the uk are terrible people
17:11:03 <the`shima> graham, bono, bob geldof
17:11:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> dont say that about jedward
17:11:09 <the`shima> oh ya jedward rule
17:11:28 <the`shima> trying to think if theres probematic welsh people
17:11:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> ian watkins
17:11:43 <the`shima> i will concede that
17:11:48 <het> https://twitter.com/woodmuffin/status/1507034422901628931
17:12:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> it would be funny to defend ian watkins on behalf wales
17:12:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> of wales
17:12:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> dreddybajs: help me make 4 cuts here https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/4694125#paper
17:13:17 <the`shima> yeah tbh i think ian watkins probably outranks all those irish pieceso f shit
17:13:23 <Selfie_Dad> jesus christ the cost of my preworkout has gone up by nearly 10 dollars
17:13:57 <dreddybajs> i shall look now
17:14:36 <Nude_Riker> lmao https://twitter.com/ELahti/status/1507007172038651909
17:14:43 <dreddybajs> lol
17:14:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> im borderline on confirm suspicions and wayfarers bauble... spellskite im not certain but it does seem good to me
17:14:45 <dreddybajs> battle pass
17:14:45 <Nude_Riker> good joke evan
17:15:01 <dreddybajs> yeah confirm suspicions doesn't seem good enough
17:15:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> bauble is mostly as an urzas saga target if i've already pulled sol ring but then again altar of the brood seems better there
17:15:44 <Selfie_Dad> lol i just read toms line of chat without seeing the previous one
17:15:46 <dreddybajs> fabricate maybe? unless you really need one of those targets consistently
17:15:50 <Selfie_Dad> and it read like he was having a stroke
17:15:55 <dreddybajs> lol
17:15:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah academy manufactor is huge
17:16:13 <dreddybajs> oh yeah i wasnt looking at artifact creatures
17:16:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> and inspiring statuary
17:16:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> howling mine i guess could be cut but its very cute with inspiring statuary
17:16:35 <dreddybajs> timeless witness maybe? just kinda expensive and not so much on theme
17:16:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> i kind of like having 2 witnesses to dig stuff back from the gy but i do have bala ged too
17:16:53 <dreddybajs> or eternal witness, but that one seems better 
17:17:17 <dreddybajs> wall of blossoms seems pretty filler-y
17:17:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah its just a body with an etb trigger really, thats the main purpose of it
17:18:20 <dreddybajs> confront the unknown maybe? doesn't seem like it does enough
17:18:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> it can win the game
17:18:35 <dreddybajs> ok all cards can do things
17:18:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> throw it on an unblocked attacker and game over
17:18:43 <dreddybajs> that is hard to argue against
17:18:55 <the`shima> a question for you all
17:18:55 <wild_ape-style_creature> dreddybajs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kvU5do52DY
17:18:58 <wild_ape-style_creature> more phil elden ring
17:19:03 <dreddybajs> hell yeah
17:19:13 <the`shima> if you had to fight the undertake in a month in an mma fight do you think you would win
17:19:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> im going to cut howling mine and confirm suspicions, feel good about those cuts
17:19:17 <the`shima> undertaker
17:19:27 <dreddybajs> good banana song
17:19:31 <ajj2> hes the best pure striker in the wwe so probably not the`shima 
17:19:35 <dreddybajs> oh yeah i didnt see howling mine, that seems like a cut
17:19:41 <dreddybajs> absolutely not the`shima 
17:19:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> i could take out the clone package with counterpart and double major but those are too funny with manufactor
17:19:47 <the`shima> i think i would
17:19:48 <dreddybajs> he would knock any of us out with one punch
17:19:51 <dreddybajs> lol
17:19:55 <dreddybajs> bro hes like twice your size
17:20:08 <the`shima> hes also 57 years old and turns slower than milk
17:20:18 <ajj2> he went toe to toe with brock lesner 
17:20:23 <the`shima> i would outfox him
17:20:24 <the`shima> with cunning
17:20:31 <ajj2> dreddybajs did you see mjf cut a promo on jesus last night
17:20:44 <dreddybajs> yeah
17:20:46 <dreddybajs> great promo lol
17:20:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> dont spoil please im going to watch it soon
17:20:56 <ajj2> o sick
17:20:59 <ajj2> last night eps was great
17:21:05 <dreddybajs> it was good
17:22:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> i had never heard of the card mechanized production until i was making this decklist
17:22:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> insane in this deck lol
17:22:14 <dreddybajs> yea that was unbeatable in limited
17:22:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> all it needs to do is live for a turn cycle
17:22:38 <dreddybajs> my friend opened a sword of body and mind expedition and put that card on it in draft Homie_in_a_geod . and beat me while i was playing UG
17:22:45 <dreddybajs> all his creatures had swords on them 
17:22:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
17:23:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> brutal
17:23:03 <Selfie_Dad> i would simply best the undertaker with facts and logic
17:23:05 <dreddybajs> yeah
17:23:22 <Selfie_Dad> .l
17:23:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> im not certain about feasting troll king in here because of the 4g in the mana cost
17:23:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> i probably get there but idk
17:24:47 <dreddybajs> i got all the vamp surv cheevos yesterday wild_ape-style_creature 
17:24:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> ehh yeah i think im going to keep it actually. too crazy with manufactor not to
17:24:54 <wild_ape-style_creature> congrats!!!
17:24:59 <wild_ape-style_creature> new patch tomorrow or sat
17:25:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> i will cut wall of blossoms though
17:25:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> Patch 0.3.2 - ETA 25/26th of March
17:25:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> Contains 5 new achievements and:
17:25:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> - Mad Forest Coffin
17:25:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> - 2.5 weapons
17:25:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> - 1 new unlockable power up
17:25:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> Tweaks:
17:25:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> - Added stage modifiers information on the Stage Selection screen
17:25:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> - Added evolution info on Level Up panels
17:25:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> - Changed treasure chests in Il Molise
17:25:13 <dreddybajs> nice
17:25:14 <wild_ape-style_creature> - Changed Il Molise unlock condition to "Unlock Hyper mode for any normal stage"
17:25:16 <wild_ape-style_creature> - Updated sprites for some items
17:25:18 <wild_ape-style_creature> - New save data system that uses a much simpler file format and should prevent issues like unlocks getting out of sync.
17:25:20 <wild_ape-style_creature> It has the drawback that the game won't be saving your coins as soon as you pick them up anymore, but will only save at the end of a run, or when opening a treasure chest.
17:25:24 <wild_ape-style_creature> Save data will be converted automatically on launching the game. The new location of the save file is %appdata%/Vampire_Survivors/saves
17:25:27 <wild_ape-style_creature> Both the save backup system in the install folder of the game and the old localdb save system will keep backing up your data as normal in case anything goes wrong, but it's still suggested to make a manual backup before launching the game on the new patch, just to stay safe.
17:25:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> down to last cut
17:25:41 <dreddybajs> simply cut, Island
17:25:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats one of the best cards in the history of the game.
17:25:57 <dreddybajs> hmm... true
17:25:57 <wild_ape-style_creature> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz05m6IBwpE here's a funny phil boss battle
17:26:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> im glad i finally have a commander deck where i can Unleash Oko
17:26:57 <scoop_jackson> the undertaker doesn't have any blood so i dont think i  could beat the undertaker in a fight
17:27:05 <ajj2> lol
17:27:05 <HellaBrad> ive been too busy with elden ring to keep up on my vampire survivors
17:27:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> sydney is going to get extremely Elked
17:27:28 <wild_ape-style_creature> simply get the rest of the chievos so oyu only have to play when a new patch comes out
17:28:06 <HellaBrad> need to be more dedicated to the vampire surviving craft
17:28:22 <wild_ape-style_creature> it's easy, all you do is avoid the enemies
17:28:30 <dreddybajs> the`shima: i dunno if you're up on cum town but the recent premium ep with jordan jensen was incredible good
17:28:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> maybe i dont need pongify in here...
17:28:39 <dreddybajs> her insane stories about her family growing up
17:28:41 <dreddybajs> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kHMPCu0Bsc
17:29:34 <HellaBrad> a simple task and yet here i am, with chievos barred
17:29:53 <dreddybajs> yeah i was thinking you have quite a few of those effects Homie_in_a_geod 
17:30:00 <dreddybajs> and your deck is proactive rather than reactive
17:30:54 <wild_ape-style_creature> phil has all this health and says he needs more health https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/A6iVW509/image.png
17:31:04 <Selfie_Dad> he does
17:31:04 <HellaBrad> phil is a great example of the stupidest way to play this game
17:31:23 <HellaBrad> hes using like the slowest weapon ive seen
17:31:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah dreddybajs 
17:31:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> basically i want all of my removal effects on bodies if possible
17:31:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> because of lonis
17:31:37 <bonegar> phil definitely needs more everything
17:32:01 <wild_ape-style_creature> i don't understand how he's allocating points
17:32:05 <wild_ape-style_creature> i will NOT watch him actually play
17:32:06 <bonegar> i finally had to retire my cool sword
17:32:21 <wild_ape-style_creature> i got the astel wing sword and i wanna use it but i'm busy with rf5
17:32:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> hrm that being said, what gets rid of creatures in this deck other than beast within
17:32:30 <HellaBrad> seems like hes put a lot of points into strength from the size of his weapon and dmg output
17:32:42 <wild_ape-style_creature> he needs to put on some pants maybe
17:32:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> rec sage and foundation breaker don't
17:32:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> cyclonic rift bounces

17:39:39 <mikev> I should’ve measured myself before the bulk
17:39:58 <mikev> Hard to notice changes in size
17:40:12 <Selfie_Dad> ull feel it in your pants eventually lol
17:40:24 <Selfie_Dad> im disregarding the cal goal it has me on and eating like ~2500 
17:40:31 <Selfie_Dad> to see if i still lose
17:40:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> i havent really been putting jeans on so its hard to tell if anything has changed there for me
17:40:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> usually just in sweatpants mode during wfh time
17:41:04 <Selfie_Dad> it doesnt happen over night but eventually ull put some pants on and notice theyre kinda falling off ur ass
17:41:08 <Selfie_Dad> even w/ sweats
17:44:31 <Selfie_Dad> at some point all my size L stuff just started sliding
17:44:42 <Selfie_Dad> really gotta engage the drawstring
17:44:51 <Selfie_Dad> .l
17:52:32 <ehn> im hungrey
17:52:34 <HellaBrad> got placidusax on my second try
17:52:38 <HellaBrad> very cool boss
17:54:37 <wild_ape-style_creature> grats

17:54:45 <dreddybajs> awesome boss
17:56:21 <bonegar> i got astel last night v. late with a cool squad, now i'm on the fire giant
17:56:29 <bonegar> cant wait to find out whateever placidusax is
17:56:48 <bonegar> i guess i married ranni or w/e no big whoop she's off to the shadow realm anyway

18:00:22 <HellaBrad> marrying ranni sounds like a much nicer story path than the ending i appear to have committed myself to, my guy seems extremely cursed
18:03:51 <bonegar> uh oh
18:03:53 <bonegar> what guy did you pick
18:03:59 <bonegar> the volcano guys?
18:04:26 <HellaBrad> im with the three fingers in the basement of the capital
18:04:26 -!- letty [~letty@synIRC-77688CA5.dyn.plus.net] has joined #phiz
18:05:02 <HellaBrad> its fun your tarnished gets cool glowing eyes
18:06:06 <dreddybajs> How Is There Already So Much ‘Elden Ring’ Porn? We Asked the People Who Made It
18:08:09 <bonegar> there's a three fingers? damn i only ever met the two fingers
18:08:13 <bonegar> i trust absolutely no fingers
18:08:37 <dreddybajs> yeah the three fingers are the frenzied flame cult guys
18:08:44 <dreddybajs> that control the pyromancy magics
18:11:12 <Selfie_Dad> i'm the weighted vest man
18:13:16 <HellaBrad> the three fingers are neat but reaching them is a terrific pain in the ass
18:14:12 <HellaBrad> its a crazy platforming puzzle in the sewers behind a weird hidden sliding secret wall
18:14:19 <bonegar> they're all british and need to die, and i hate when ranni talks to me but she has a cool hat and hates everyone, i'm kinda wondering if i can agree to teh volcano people stuff to see more content but i dont like them but i wanna kill stuff in the volcano manor
18:14:35 <dreddybajs> yeah you should be able to bonegar and it doesnt commit you to any ending or anything
18:14:48 <dreddybajs> but its just some assassination side missions, you can explore the dungeon without joining i think
18:14:53 <HellaBrad> i definitely screwed up whatever the volcano people wanted me to do lol
18:15:36 <HellaBrad> yeah i just went with the three fingers because they were the only faction who never told me what to do
18:16:27 <bonegar> i respect it
18:16:27 <dreddybajs> i did ranni because i generally like the concept of letting go of the cycle and ushering in something new
18:16:30 <dreddybajs> in the souls games
18:16:50 <bonegar> yah same dreddy
18:17:08 <bonegar> some cycle ya got here *looking around at all the zombies*
18:17:14 <dreddybajs> in this one they make it the most obvious that that's maybe not a "bad ending" 
18:17:24 <dreddybajs> by having npcs literally go "damn... you ever think these two fingers might kinda suck ass??"
18:17:28 <dreddybajs> which is very funny to me
18:17:32 <bonegar> i've ignored the lore in this more than any other game
18:17:43 <bonegar> lol yea
18:17:46 <dreddybajs> i wanna know more about the mimics
18:17:50 <dreddybajs> and the ghost minotaurs
18:17:52 <bonegar> it's very over-the-top with the lore compared to every other from game
18:17:53 <Melber> games whose lore has interested me: fallout, zelda
18:18:35 <bonegar> i liked the dark souls 'lore' because it's very abstract and you can project whatever you want onto it
18:18:46 <bonegar> elden ring definitely is a slight departure into more 'normal' stuff
18:19:03 <dreddybajs> yeah maybe that's partly the grrm influence
18:19:04 <Nude_Riker> https://twitter.com/ClubPhotos_/status/1506360082619154483
18:19:35 <HellaBrad> the rot-bugs and the mushroom-folk and the albinaurics all clearly have culture and ritual, i want to learn more about those, not this weird fucking elden royal family with a bunch of alliterative names
18:19:50 <bonegar> i gotta find three fingers tho
18:19:57 <bonegar> what is the closest grace 
18:20:03 <HellaBrad> give me a mushroom or bug npc please george rr martin
18:20:18 <Nude_Riker> all i want from grrm is the last fucking book
18:20:30 <bonegar> the mushroom folk armor is very funny
18:20:34 <bonegar> but too scary for me to wear
18:20:37 <HellaBrad> bonegar if you've found the underground roadside you're in the right area
18:20:49 <bonegar> dont think i got to the underground roadside yet
18:21:06 <bonegar> what's the nearest to that in the capital overworld
18:21:06 <HellaBrad> its down a well in the middle of the capital
18:21:10 <dreddybajs> bonegar: there's a well in the capital that you can climb down and it leads to a big underground zone
18:21:26 <bonegar> looks like ol bones is gonna do some well hunting tonight
18:21:29 <dreddybajs> avenue balcony grace -> go down the stairs -> hug the left wall and jump off to the left at the 2nd set of roofs
18:21:35 <dreddybajs> and the well is right in front of you
18:21:44 <dreddybajs> its annoying to find otherwise
18:22:34 <bonegar> rip sword of night and flame, my new sword husband is darkmoon great sword
18:22:48 <HellaBrad> good sword to marry imo
18:22:54 <wild_ape-style_creature> post screenshot
18:23:04 <bonegar> i liked sword of night and flame a lot, but it was very slow and had short reach
18:23:24 <bonegar> i can post my fit lemme boot up the game
18:23:51 <HellaBrad> I wanna respec and try out some of the cool faith build swords
18:23:53 <bonegar> i was unable to do astel in the full snowwitch fit, so i had to modify it
18:24:01 <dreddybajs> darkmoon great sword the goat
18:24:04 <dreddybajs> i havent tried it yet
18:24:10 <bonegar> having some faith absolutely rules
18:24:12 <HellaBrad> Coded sword is really neat looking, I wanna play with that a bit
18:24:38 <HellaBrad> Riding a coffin over a waterfall ftw this game rules
18:25:24 <dreddybajs> that part is so funny
18:25:28 <HellaBrad> the coffin area transitions in this game are the best theyve ever been
18:25:32 <dreddybajs> that your guy is just like, hmm what if i got in the coffin
18:25:35 <bonegar> lol i love watching those
18:25:52 <scoop_jackson> audible says that kitty kelly narrated the audiobook im about to buy
18:25:58 <bonegar> https://i.imgur.com/KxDt2sy.jpg
18:25:59 <HellaBrad> i mean thats a fromsoft staple but its hilarious to me that they made the coffins diagetically move in their own little transitory cut scenes
18:26:00 <scoop_jackson> i wonder if its that kitty kelly
18:26:01 <bonegar> my current fit/build
18:26:57 <HellaBrad> very good outfit, ambitiously well-rounded char
18:27:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> bonegar that's sick
18:27:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> i liked the snow witch outfit but i'm wearing stupid armor because i'm still not that great at dodging attacks
18:27:32 <bonegar> i need to up end and faith
18:27:33 <bonegar> er
18:27:36 <bonegar> end and mind
18:27:57 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm using the same shield you have
18:27:58 <alansmithee_> snow witch gives some good bonuses
18:28:12 <bonegar> yeah i was wearing stupid armor for awhile, trying lionel's set
18:28:48 <bonegar> my now i'm all nox swordstress armor, firemonk gauntlets, and nox monk greeves with the ranni hat
18:28:52 <HellaBrad> heres me atm https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/lH9gmFcg/%21outfit.png
18:29:02 <bonegar> oh damn that's so cool
18:29:09 <bonegar> i saw a guy in that armor awhile back
18:29:16 <bonegar> extremely Ex-Death vibe, so cool looking
18:29:21 <bonegar> i haven't found that helmet yet
18:29:23 <HellaBrad> yeah the crucible knight set is really sick
18:29:26 <wild_ape-style_creature> i don't like battling those guys
18:29:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> but they look cool
18:29:34 <wild_ape-style_creature> they kill me immediately
18:29:56 <scoop_jackson> man all the hats in that game look incredible
18:30:06 <HellaBrad> you get this one in the deeproot depths after another one of the incredible coffin transitions
18:30:15 <HellaBrad> this one takes you UP a waterfall
18:30:15 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm still wearing double burger king because of the int boost
18:30:22 <wild_ape-style_creature> but i guess i could switch to something else at this point
18:35:01 <bonegar> i still use that goofy meteor staff for all my spells because it has an S in int
18:35:20 <dreddybajs> yeah that stays good until you upgrade the other ones to like, almost max level
18:35:33 <dreddybajs> im using renalla's staff but it's not insane
18:36:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> still on one card to cut from this deck
18:37:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> maybe a signet since i have so many mana dorks
18:42:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> eh ill go without pongify and see how badly i feel like i need creature removal later
18:42:38 <HellaBrad> yeah i dont think theres really a better staff than the meteorite until you get into like some of the 50-int ones
18:43:24 <HellaBrad> the int boost from the burger kings is solid, ive busted that one out for a couple boss fights where i need the extra dmg
18:44:16 <dreddybajs> the renalla hat gives you +3 with no downside, ive been using that
18:45:32 <Melber> Selfie_Dad: you ever heard of this https://untappd.com/b/the-wild-beer-co-smoke-n-barrels-summer/1611288
18:45:52 <Melber> lmao dogfish head with the funniest collab ive seen in a while
18:46:26 <Melber> pilsner collaboration with patagonia
18:46:34 <bonegar> barrel aged smoked orange gose
18:46:44 <bonegar> a lot going on there
18:46:47 <bonegar> how's it taste?
18:46:58 <bonegar> i've had some really good goses, and some really bad ones, but the good ones slay
18:46:59 <Melber> idk i havent had it yet
18:47:02 <Melber> it's at the store
18:47:12 <bonegar> if you doo i look forward to hearing about it, if not no problem ever even once
18:52:34 <bonegar> eating my spicy beef today and if im being honest, i made my spicy beef too spicy
18:53:14 <letty> what spices did u add
18:53:49 <bonegar> sesame chili oil, thai chilis, paprika were the main spices i added at very stages of prep
18:54:18 <bonegar> i think the thai chilis are probably taking the paprika and sesame chili oil over the top
18:54:25 <bonegar> coulda used regular sesame oil
18:54:26 <scoop_jackson> Get some Doubanjiang bone
18:54:49 <bonegar> that's like, spicy oil bound with bean right?
18:54:53 <bonegar> wondering if i could make some
18:55:21 <scoop_jackson> I’ve made it but i can buy the fermented black beans at the hmart
18:55:25 <bonegar> i do have tofu in the fridge, i coulda made mabodoofu outta this
18:55:59 <bonegar> thinking of like, a beef-based mabodoofu approach
18:56:02 <bonegar> and this could be very good
18:56:54 <bonegar> i only eat seafood and beef, and occasionally chicken, and only pork if an italian guy did something to it...which is very strange i know
18:57:25 <scoop_jackson> Yeah fish also works well with the red soup style
18:57:53 <bonegar> ive never tried to make it
18:58:13 <bonegar> i can't imagine making XO sauce but spicy beancurd sauce seems more approachable
18:59:23 <scoop_jackson> https://redhousespice.com/sichuan-boiled-fish/
18:59:35 <bonegar> 水煮鱼 rules
18:59:49 <bonegar> easily an all time dish
19:00:44 <scoop_jackson> Hell yeah
19:01:08 <HellaBrad> sichuan cooking is so good, that was pretty much all i ate when i went to restaurants in china
19:01:39 <HellaBrad> i should have tried more tbh i didn't go to enough
19:02:24 <bonegar> the addiction of the sichuan peppercorn to an aggressively spicy dish is god tier for sure
19:02:28 <bonegar> addition
19:02:46 <HellaBrad> addicting addition
19:03:03 <HellaBrad> you will begin to crave the rare weird pirahna plant peppercorns
19:03:09 <scoop_jackson> ^
19:03:13 <bonegar> never heard of these 
19:03:19 <bonegar> but i would like to try them
19:03:25 <Nude_Riker> i should buy some sichuan peppercorn
19:03:29 <Nude_Riker> numbing heat ftw
19:03:58 <bonegar> wasabi/horseradish, sichuan peppercorn, and other peppercorns, and chilis 
19:04:01 <bonegar> the big 3
19:04:08 <letty> damn
19:04:22 <HellaBrad> i just always thought thats what they reminded me of when they crack open in a dish, little pirahna plants
19:04:33 <Nude_Riker> sichuan peppercorn is unique so itd be big 4 imo
19:04:44 <bonegar> the idea of starting off with horseradish, getting numbed by the peppercorn, then rounding out with the lingering heat of a thai chili *chef's kiss* send me on a journey to hell for eating flesh
19:04:56 <Selfie_Dad> little
19:05:28 <bonegar> regular fresh pepper cracked has a smiliar effect i think
19:05:48 <bonegar> what are your big 4 heats then?
19:06:23 <Nude_Riker> i mean your list of 4 things, i wouldnt group the sichuan with other peppercorns
19:06:36 <bonegar> i should really learn to master making 水煮鱼 tho
19:06:50 <bonegar> they're all peppercorns biologically though
19:06:55 <Nude_Riker> i hate category brain so much precisely because i am so afflicted by it
19:07:02 <letty> @bonegar, in contrast - I went to blackpool today and the cafe we went to had 5 different types of gammon you could have. Gammon with egg, gammon with chips, gammon with mustard, gammon with coleslaw, gammon with all 
19:07:03 <bonegar> i think if i fractured it i'd have to split up the chili peppers too
19:07:11 <bonegar> lmao
19:07:14 <bonegar> you went to blackpool?
19:07:16 <bonegar> any gammon pics?
19:07:27 <Nude_Riker> right but only the sichuan has the numbing, whereas peppers share capsaicin
19:07:32 <bonegar> how was the sea?
19:07:32 <wild_ape-style_creature> i have a bunch of sichuan peppercorns but h ahven't done anything with them
19:07:33 <Selfie_Dad> Melber: ive seen that stuff but i think ive only had one or two, and not that one
19:07:43 <wild_ape-style_creature> gotta figure out something
19:07:57 <bonegar> <Nude_Riker> right but only the sichuan has the numbing, whereas peppers share capsaicin  <- yea 100% with you, but i gotta break it up somehow
19:08:03 <Nude_Riker> so biologically it makes sense, but not in use
19:08:09 <Selfie_Dad> it sounds good though, i love a good gratzer/grodziskie
19:08:12 <bonegar> i think kinda in use too
19:08:14 <bonegar> due to shape
19:08:20 <bonegar> but i definitely get what you mean
19:08:21 <Selfie_Dad> my friend used to make one w/ 100% oak smoked wheat malt
19:08:26 <Nude_Riker> in application i guess
19:08:32 <Nude_Riker> or effect
19:08:43 <letty> only these: https://imgur.com/a/pZATUQ3
19:08:49 <bonegar> sometimes you get peppercorn medleys 
19:08:54 <Nude_Riker> yeah
19:09:04 <bonegar> there's a lot in the peppercorn world much like the chili world
19:09:08 <HellaBrad> dark moon greatsword is very cool, just beat those bosses
19:09:15 <Selfie_Dad> .gis corn medley
19:09:24 <HellaBrad> love a good peppercorn medley
19:09:26 <bonegar> a habanero isn't a jalapeno
19:09:28 <letty> I'd like to do more w sichuan pepper
19:09:30 <Nude_Riker> the main problem i have with the sichuan restaurant i like here is they dont add extra peppercorn when i ask for it, i want more numb
19:09:46 <letty> I heard you can get sichuan buds that u can infuse
19:09:49 <Nude_Riker> tbh everything i get from them i wish was spicier
19:09:51 <wild_ape-style_creature> bring your own peppercorns
19:09:57 <wild_ape-style_creature> byop
19:10:00 <Selfie_Dad> i wish we had a sichuan place around here
19:10:02 <bonegar> here's an idea, peleton sation but instead it's a wok station
19:10:07 <Selfie_Dad> i would love some dan dan noodle
19:10:12 <bonegar> and you have master chefs to cook along to
19:10:37 <Nude_Riker> idk if they just make mine extra mild because white guy name or if they overreact to the "sichuan means hot" stereotype, even though their name is literally "Red Pepper"
19:10:49 <Selfie_Dad> we have this place http://www.confuciusrb.com/dinner.html
19:10:54 <bonegar> classic 'white guy' problem lol
19:11:02 <scoop_jackson> maybe they just dont make it super spicy
19:11:02 <Selfie_Dad> which is good as hell but not a sichuan style
19:11:21 <bonegar> im not sure i've ever had frog legs
19:11:39 <bonegar> chicken feet? of course
19:11:41 <Nude_Riker> thats what im saying for the second part scoop_jackson, they mention on their site something about like "szechuan food is about more than spice"
19:11:45 <bonegar> but not frog leg, oddly
19:11:54 <Nude_Riker> and im overinterpreting that to be reactionary
19:11:54 <HellaBrad> frog lets are okay, theyre good in hot pot
19:11:59 <HellaBrad> very mild flavour
19:12:00 <Selfie_Dad> i think ive had em once
19:12:08 <Selfie_Dad> they were fine
19:12:08 <Nude_Riker> the first time i had frog legs was in baja mexico
19:12:18 <bonegar> i wouldnt not eat them, but i also don't know enough about them to understand them as a food
19:12:28 <HellaBrad> chicken feet are also good
19:12:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> not a fan of chicken feet
19:12:41 <Selfie_Dad> kinda like eating a chicken wing i guess
19:12:42 <Nude_Riker> ive never had fried chicken feet or anything, only used them to make stock
19:12:48 <bonegar> i love how in elden ring you can chow down on chicken feet for rune and item drop bonuses
19:12:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> too chewy and visually unappealing
19:12:49 <bonegar> gets me hungry
19:12:55 <letty> this was the cafe - https://imgur.com/a/W5n63IL - this is basically what you'd get in america isn't it, except different words
19:12:58 <Nude_Riker> id like to try a chicken foot dish though
19:12:59 <HellaBrad> i get em every now and then when i go out for dim sum
19:13:08 <bonegar> they're usually pickled
19:13:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> we dont eat beans on toast here
19:13:19 <bonegar> dim sum ftw
19:13:36 <wild_ape-style_creature> thin fries or fat chips
19:13:54 <Nude_Riker> you'd get a number of those things but not all letty 
19:14:01 <bonegar> halloumi is one of those very famous things i've never had much
19:14:13 <Nude_Riker> we typically use hollandaise a lot less than that menu does
19:14:23 <HellaBrad> tried halloumi for the first time recently, just pan fried in some sandwiches
19:14:25 <HellaBrad> was nice
19:14:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> halloumi is very good
19:14:36 <Nude_Riker> i rarely see diners/cafes use hollandaise for anything other than eggs benedict
19:14:38 <letty> squeaky cheese
19:14:49 <letty> really HR?
19:14:49 <bonegar> thinking deeply about my Quilligan's order
19:15:15 <letty> they do home made american pancakes
19:15:23 <letty> so u will all feel at home
19:15:28 <Nude_Riker> also in america you get many more pancakes usually
19:15:35 <HellaBrad> have never had black pudding
19:15:35 <bonegar> roast beef dinner with home made onion rings, and i'm making eyecontact with everyone involved
19:15:37 <Nude_Riker> americans love to have 10-20 pancakes
19:15:39 <wild_ape-style_creature> pancakes
19:15:44 <bonegar> that's my quilligan's order
19:15:49 <letty> lol
19:16:01 <scoop_jackson> can you get a bacon egg and cheese at that place letty
19:16:09 <letty> w horeradish bonegar??
19:16:19 <bonegar> i love horseradish
19:16:21 <Nude_Riker> mmm horseradish
19:16:32 <wild_ape-style_creature> i don't think i've ever had horseradish
19:16:38 <bonegar> horseradish w/ beef ftw
19:16:51 <letty> scoop, possibly - the egg is hardboiled tho, is that a dealbreaker
19:16:51 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i woldnt wanna eat a chicken foot, just to add to swtock or something
19:17:05 <bonegar> shrimp if you've had wasabi in the USA that's just died green horseradish
19:17:14 <wild_ape-style_creature> oh
19:17:22 <bonegar> wasabi is just a type of cool horseradish cultivar
19:17:24 <HellaBrad> yeah horseradish sauce is just wasabi and mayo or sour cream
19:17:28 <Nude_Riker> if i was ordering breakfast from that menu i would get: eggs royale (never heard this name before)
19:17:35 <HellaBrad> basically
19:17:50 <letty> i had chicken feet, it was good but it was someones birthday and she ordered from the 'secret' menu and I was spitting politely every few minutes because of all the bones
19:17:54 <Nude_Riker> thats specific types of prepared horseradish
19:18:14 <bonegar> yea, chicken feet is like lobster or crab or sunflower seeds or pistachios
19:18:15 <Nude_Riker> i like the red horseradish sauce too
19:18:18 <bonegar> you gotta do some work
19:18:20 <HellaBrad> eggs royale sounds good, im partial to a nice eggs florentine or maybe id try a black pudding omelette
19:18:35 <Nude_Riker> i just dont like omelettes, id like some black pudding tho
19:18:37 <letty> would u get thin fries or fat chips
19:18:43 <Nude_Riker> whats the difference
19:18:46 <bonegar> thin fries
19:18:47 <letty> wtf
19:18:51 <Nude_Riker> are thin fries crisps
19:18:57 <bonegar> mcdonalds fries vs steakhouse fries
19:18:58 <letty> no!
19:18:59 <bonegar> i imagine
19:19:02 <letty> ya
19:19:03 <Nude_Riker> or is this like mcdonalds vs steakhouse yeah
19:19:04 <HellaBrad> thin fries are american style mat
19:19:13 <HellaBrad> whereas fat chips are like an american steakhouse cut fry
19:19:18 <Nude_Riker> id get fat fries
19:19:25 <Nude_Riker> thin fries feel inappropriate for breakfast
19:19:28 <letty> except fat chips are probably a bit soggier than 'steakhouse'
19:19:42 <Nude_Riker> thin fries are for lunch or dinner
19:19:46 <wild_ape-style_creature> i would get the thin ones because i don't like a soggy fry
19:20:05 <bonegar> brits love a soggy fry
19:20:07 <HellaBrad> yeah fat fries is closest to the correct breakfast potato choice which is homestyle hash browns
19:20:11 <Nude_Riker> my preferred breakfast potatoes are hashbrowns
19:20:21 <HellaBrad> NOT string
19:20:37 <Nude_Riker> i like my hashbrowns very crisp
19:20:41 <bonegar> diner hashbrown 
19:20:43 <Nude_Riker> like a crust
19:20:46 <bonegar> and diner coffee
19:20:52 <Nude_Riker> most diner hashbrowns are too soggy ime
19:20:58 <letty> ive yet to make good hashbrowns
19:21:00 <wild_ape-style_creature> order all potatoes extra crispy
19:21:02 <bonegar> with diner scrambled egg and diner toast and two bits of diner bacon
19:21:06 <letty> cant get all the water out
19:21:17 <Nude_Riker> yeah you gotta squeeze em real good after grating
19:21:21 <Nude_Riker> and wash them
19:21:22 <HellaBrad> perfect breakfast hash browns were the first thing i learned to cook at like 8 years old
19:21:26 <bonegar> i've had some really good not-soggy diner hashbrowns
19:21:30 <Nude_Riker> well, rinse
19:21:35 <HellaBrad> grated hash browns are for maniacs
19:21:35 <wild_ape-style_creature> waffle house hashbrowns ftw
19:21:43 <bonegar> but the diner by me closed down due to to various protests about black children being shot
19:21:44 <Nude_Riker> well brad as you well know i am a maniac
19:21:47 <HellaBrad> just cube your potatoes and get on with living folks, fry em up
19:21:53 <Nude_Riker> thats not hasbrowns imo
19:21:56 <Nude_Riker> thats homefries
19:21:58 <Nude_Riker> which i also like
19:21:59 <wild_ape-style_creature> ^
19:22:02 <HellaBrad> ill go to war with you matt
19:22:14 <Nude_Riker> homefries are also breakfast potatoes of choice
19:22:18 <letty> are you ever tempted to add something more than onion and potato
19:22:25 <bonegar> homefries are a real trick, the only way i know how to make them is to shake them in a bag with spices and oil, put them on a grate and bake them for over an hour
19:22:28 <Nude_Riker> i dont put onion in my hashbrowns
19:22:28 <bonegar> that's the only way
19:22:36 <letty> wtf
19:22:37 <HellaBrad> garlic and bell peppers are also good adds
19:22:52 <Nude_Riker> what i HAVE done is make hashbrowns with kimchi in them and that is really good
19:23:03 <HellaBrad> kimchi goes great with potatoes
19:23:06 <bonegar> .gis kimchi hashbrown
19:23:21 <bonegar> going fully potato cake. makes sense
19:23:23 <bonegar> chijimi style
19:23:37 <Nude_Riker> you cant add onion to grated hashbrowns and get the timing of cooking right if you make them cake style unfortunately, you can do it if you do it diner style with a flat top and parcook and super fast fry though
19:23:53 <Nude_Riker> if you add onion to cake style hashbrowns you will get burnt onion
19:24:03 <bonegar> oh yea there's another spice in this beef i forgot
19:24:04 <bonegar> ginger
19:24:05 <letty> oh interesting
19:24:27 <Nude_Riker> that kimchi hashbrown picture looks very good
19:24:41 <Selfie_Dad> damn my lunch was good
19:24:46 <Selfie_Dad> i want more
19:24:48 <bonegar> .gis チヂミ
19:24:50 <Selfie_Dad> but there is no more....
19:24:50 <HellaBrad> yeah the advantage to smaller like a diced homestyle hash brown is you can add more veggies and just keep stirring till its all crispy and perfect
19:25:12 <HellaBrad> cant neglect the ginger in your spice mix 
19:25:17 <Nude_Riker> yeah i like that too but its a very different dish
19:25:18 <Selfie_Dad> stocked up on broccoli slaw 2day
19:25:22 <Selfie_Dad> broccoli slaw ftw
19:25:45 <letty> could u just use an egg in ur grated potato to make it come together
19:25:52 <bonegar> broc is so hard for me to tame
19:25:57 <Nude_Riker> letty i try so hard to be nice to you
19:26:01 <letty> lol
19:26:15 <letty> u do u do
19:26:31 <Nude_Riker> and then you say why dont you put eggs in the hashbrowns
19:26:31 <Selfie_Dad> i want my new monitor Now
19:26:59 <Selfie_Dad> the only way u put egg in hashbrown is when u lay two fried ones on top of it after its already cooked
19:27:01 <letty> it feels like it cuts out the middle man Nude_Riker
19:27:12 <Nude_Riker> thats right Selfie_Dad 
19:27:21 <letty> and I know its a slippery slope to just chopping bacon into it
19:27:22 <bonegar> if you put egg into a hashbrown that's a potato pancake not a hasbrown hth
19:27:24 <HellaBrad> correct
19:27:42 <bonegar> and by all means make a potato pancake imo
19:27:44 <Nude_Riker> though to be honest thats again an area where tradition actually isnt good to me, i always regret eating my eggs together with the hashbrowns
19:27:44 <Selfie_Dad> frankly the application of the term 'hashbrown' is too broad to begin with
19:27:59 <Nude_Riker> i prefer my eggs on the side
19:28:04 <bonegar> .g definition of hash
19:28:10 <bonegar> .g definition of brown
19:28:17 <Selfie_Dad> lol
19:28:18 <Nude_Riker> yeah potato HASH is what brad has been describing
19:28:20 <letty> could you add a lil flour to sop up some of the moisture of a hashbrown and still call it a hashbrown/
19:28:22 <bonegar> uh o
19:28:26 <Selfie_Dad> i think the hash brown needs to be exta crispy style in order for it to stand up to egg yolk
19:28:28 <letty> I'm looking for the workarounds
19:28:30 <Selfie_Dad> w/o getting gummy 
19:28:41 <Nude_Riker> what are you trying to work around here
19:28:48 <letty> too wet
19:29:01 <Nude_Riker> you just need to squeeze your potatoes better
19:29:01 <HellaBrad> id use cornstarch if i had too but just pressing them in a paper towel after you grate should be enough
19:29:15 <Nude_Riker> i really wring mine out in my hands over a strainer
19:29:22 <letty> if I add onion i feel like i make it 2 wet
19:29:27 <Nude_Riker> well dont add onion
19:29:29 <letty> I know u said dont add onion
19:29:33 <bonegar> i dont make hashbrowns because of all the soaking and wringing
19:29:35 <HellaBrad> yeah the onions release too much moisture as they cooke
19:29:37 <letty> but I like the onion flavour
19:29:46 <letty> spring onion maybe?
19:29:49 <Nude_Riker> yeah its all a big production bonegar so i dont do it often
19:29:53 <Nude_Riker> spring onion on top is great
19:29:56 <bonegar> you ever throw an entire onion onto a campfire and watch it burn?
19:30:00 <bonegar> anyone else as twisted as me?
19:30:03 <HellaBrad> yeah this is why again the homefrie is a superior format
19:30:07 <mpg> you can make the hash browns first and then cook down some onion on the side and add them in at the end or on top
19:30:09 <HellaBrad> i have burned an onion
19:30:12 <HellaBrad> smells good
19:30:13 <Nude_Riker> never been in a position where i could do that bonegar 
19:30:15 <bonegar> it's amazing to see, each layero f the onion burns up and there is more water within
19:30:21 <HellaBrad> its really cool
19:30:25 <bonegar> camping rules
19:30:34 <wild_ape-style_creature> throw a can of soda into the fire when it's time to go to sleep
19:30:35 <Nude_Riker> i mean ive been camping, and ive had onions, but not at the same time
19:30:40 <HellaBrad> coolest thing i ever burned camping was we found an enormous wooden door in frame
19:30:46 <bonegar> you get to play with fire. you get to hang out and stare at the night sky. nobody bother you. 
19:30:47 <HellaBrad> stood it up in a fire pit and lit it up
19:30:49 <bonegar> easily the best hobby
19:30:57 <letty> we used to put deoderant cans in the fire when we used to go camping, hehe
19:31:09 <wild_ape-style_creature> rofl
19:31:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> just unopened sodas here
19:31:23 <HellaBrad> soda sounds like a funny one
19:31:24 <bonegar> just onion for me
19:31:25 <letty> haha nice one
19:31:41 <bonegar> damn  i want to camp
19:31:45 <bonegar> it's almost camping season
19:31:54 <wild_ape-style_creature> i haven't been camping since i was a kid
19:31:58 <Nude_Riker> i will probably camp this summer, im not a camper generally
19:32:00 <letty> in america they like to do marshmallows on big skewers
19:32:05 <Nude_Riker> thats right letty
19:32:06 <bonegar> i got into camping BIG in 2020
19:32:12 <bonegar> i've always liked it
19:32:15 <Nude_Riker> usually on sticks, skewers are for weenies
19:32:25 <wild_ape-style_creature> the idea is cool but i'd rather sleep in my own bed
19:32:29 <letty> u call em some mores
19:32:31 <Nude_Riker> right wild_ape-style_creature 
19:32:33 <bonegar> but in 2020 all the parks were abandoned and i could jsut go by myself and never be bothered, then i kept doing it last year
19:32:34 <bonegar> so fun
19:32:52 <HellaBrad> thats cool
19:33:23 <Nude_Riker> i have a VERY strong attachment to sleeping in my own bed, when i was younger and did more going out and partying i would almost always reject an offer to crash somewhere in favor of walking home drunk several miles at 3am
19:33:25 <letty> if it were warmer i'd do it alot, also if I wasn't as obsessed with doing well at work
19:33:29 <HellaBrad> having other people around while you camp sucks
19:33:38 <Selfie_Dad> slep
19:33:41 <Selfie_Dad> bed ftw
19:33:44 <Selfie_Dad> i need a new pillow
19:33:50 <Selfie_Dad> anyone got pillow recs
19:34:04 <Nude_Riker> yeah i need a new pillow too, ive never had a good pillow though
19:34:10 <mpg> i got a pair of the weird purple pillows last year and they rock but $$$
19:34:15 <ajj2> lol speaking of undertaker this sounds like a clickhole thing https://64.media.tumblr.com/412f9407280a492c2466de3ce803e24e/fac8f7dd6398b91a-81/s540x810/cfb25efcb4ed273655745c616e8a662b34916c29.jpg
19:34:30 <bonegar> pillows are a nightmare 
19:34:41 <letty> "<Nude_Riker> i have a VERY strong attachment to sleeping in my own bed, when i was younger and did more going out and partying i would almost always reject an offer to crash somewhere in favor of walking home drunk several miles at 3am" - v v v much feel this. i'd get absolutely pilled out of my brain and still be like, i'm walking home - just miles and miles gurning my head off
19:34:51 <bonegar> my bed probably has like... 9 to 13 pillows on it
19:34:55 <bonegar> and i maybe use 1
19:35:12 <Melber> also Selfie_Dad, riwaka/nelson sauvin saison from elder pine 
19:35:13 <Melber> https://myemail.constantcontact.com/The-Wine-Source----Beer-Mail-03-17-22.html?soid=1117729657484&aid=NhQaZ3avK04
19:35:26 <mpg> Selfie_Dad: before that i got "hotel pillows" from amazon and they're a variety of good ones
19:35:34 <Selfie_Dad> damn... speaking bill's language
19:35:35 <Nude_Riker> i had 4 pillows on my bed for a while 2 years ago after my sister made fun of me for not having enough pillows but i kept throwing them off at night so im back to two pillows or one depending
19:35:46 <scoop_jackson> i feel the same way Nude_Riker but i also like camping
19:35:49 <bonegar> gotta have at least 6 pillows for throwing off in the night
19:35:52 <Melber> i can grab you a bottle, it's probably like 13 bucks
19:35:52 <Selfie_Dad> i dont want multiple pillows i think, it doesnt work for me
19:35:57 <Melber> and i def owe you beers
19:35:58 <Selfie_Dad> i just want one Good one
19:36:00 <scoop_jackson> maybe part of it is the deliria from sleep deprivation 
19:36:03 <Selfie_Dad> u dont owe me shit
19:36:11 <bonegar> mulitple pillows do not work, it's a cope
19:36:19 <Melber> multiple pillows rule
19:36:19 <mpg> i have 4 and only use 2 at a time, but i switch bed sides frequently
19:36:22 <wild_ape-style_creature> i ahve three pillows but i only use one
19:36:22 <Nude_Riker> yeah Selfie_Dad if i could fine the right pillow... my life would be fixed
19:36:27 <bonegar> it's a cope
19:36:42 <wild_ape-style_creature> i have a slime and doraemon and one of the train station cats sitting on my unused pillows
19:36:46 <wild_ape-style_creature> that is their throne
19:36:49 <bonegar> no right pillow, so i have a dozen wrong ones
19:37:03 <HellaBrad> i have seven pillows and rotate between using 2-3 at a time
19:37:12 <wild_ape-style_creature> i like sleeping flat
19:37:15 <Melber> my current setup is one behind the pillow i put my head on to keep it from falling between the mattress and the headboard, and then the blanket i curl up around underneath the pillow for a little extra height
19:37:17 <wild_ape-style_creature> flat pillow
19:37:27 <wild_ape-style_creature> i don't have a headboard or a bed frame
19:37:32 <wild_ape-style_creature> the window is behind my head
19:37:36 <bonegar> yeah, sleeping is largely about trying to layh out your skeleton in a good manner
19:37:46 <bonegar> pillows are a trap, and i'm ensnared
19:37:47 <Nude_Riker> i have one memory foam pillow i use for lying on my back to listen to asmr before sleep then i switch to a normal style pillow when i go to sleep, sometimes i put it on the memory foam one
19:38:01 <Nude_Riker> since i side sleep
19:38:12 <Selfie_Dad> https://www.ecosa.com/pillow
19:38:16 <Selfie_Dad> looking at this one
19:38:23 <Selfie_Dad> should have gotten it when it was on sale for 60 bucks
19:38:24 <bonegar> i got really obsessed with my skeleton for awhile and would try to hold my head up with my hands to lay my skull down to sleep, and it works pretty well but sleeping is so hard
19:38:41 <Melber> i had a pillow like that but i hated it
19:38:42 <Selfie_Dad> wirecutter says its good for side sleepers to alleviate neck and shoulder pain
19:38:43 <Nude_Riker> sleeping is really hard
19:38:48 <Melber> i like to get my arms under the pillow
19:38:49 <Selfie_Dad> yeah sleep is tough
19:39:02 <wild_ape-style_creature> i simply get in bed and close my eyes and sleep
19:39:03 <Nude_Riker> thats the same shape as my existing memory foam pillow and it is not good at all for side sleeping for me
19:39:11 <Selfie_Dad> i like to get my arms under the pillow too but i try to avoid it because i know its not good for my shoulders
19:39:14 <bonegar> i think a lot about spine alignment when i sleep, so like.. too many pillows or wrong pillow can be really bad for that
19:39:24 <Selfie_Dad> because eventually im leaning right on the joint
19:39:37 <Nude_Riker> granted my current one is i think somehow sharper image branded that i bought from a bed bath and beyond
19:39:41 <Melber> i start on my side but usually shift to my stomach
19:39:42 <Selfie_Dad> and i bang my shoulders up on the regular anyway so i look for any way to keep from adding stress to them
19:39:48 <Selfie_Dad> i cant do stomach
19:39:58 <Selfie_Dad> and i like how laying on my back feels but i cant fall asleep that way
19:40:06 <wild_ape-style_creature> i sleep on my back with my arms by my sides
19:40:08 <HellaBrad> yeahi have to sprawl out so i can lay my whole arm flat so im not putting pressure on my elbow or my ulnar nerve
19:40:16 <bonegar> yeah i had an insanely bad problem where i would just cram my skull as hard as i could into my headboard and then wake up with my shoulders/neck hurting
19:40:18 <Melber> i sometimes end up sleeping that way but i try not to because it means i will snore and lynz wont sleep
19:40:29 <Melber> bonegar da burrower
19:40:41 <bonegar> yea
19:40:51 <bonegar> bad problem, very bad for neck/shoulders so i had to adjust
19:41:19 <bonegar> like bruxism but for the head
19:41:51 <Nude_Riker> the main problem with the memory foam for side sleeping is it makes my jaw set hard and thats bad

19:47:01 <Selfie_Dad> The Original Casper Pillow
19:47:02 <Selfie_Dad> Good for: all sleep positions
19:47:02 <Selfie_Dad> One tester loved this pillow, while everybody else thought it was just fine. It wasn’t as moldable or supportive as our side- and back-sleepers wanted. Stomach-sleepers who preferred a flatter pillow found the Casper too thick, though they noted that it was useful for stomach-sleepers who shift to their side throughout the night.
19:47:03 <Selfie_Dad> lol
19:47:03 <Nude_Riker> yeah antiracist_baby i was going insane reading about that
19:47:08 <antiracist_baby> im going insane right now
19:47:17 <Selfie_Dad> thats definitely the story of the year
19:47:26 <bonegar> i think in a few hours im gonna get really messed up on weed then take a big shower, and big name and wake up at 3 am and play dark souls
19:47:47 <Nude_Riker> its a wonder anyone in history slept at all considering how bad bed tech was, it still sucks
19:47:50 <Selfie_Dad> sounds like a plan
19:47:59 <scoop_jackson> big name?
19:48:01 <bonegar> <Nude_Riker> its a wonder anyone in history slept at all considering how bad bed tech was, it still sucks <- myth of progress
19:48:07 <bonegar> meant to type big nap

19:49:19 <Selfie_Dad> honestly when i see japanese people sleeping on the floor with a fuckin plank propping their head up in an ozu movie
19:49:23 <Selfie_Dad> im like, that looks kinda nice
19:49:32 <Nude_Riker> when i was a little kid i loved sleeping on the floor
19:49:47 <bonegar> i've been commiting to at least 10 pushups in the morning and evening, for only 20 pushups a day... and i'm kinda at the point i wouldn't mind doing actual weight training again but happy to tow this low-effort style

19:56:58 <antiracist_baby> i guess that was today form e
19:58:15 <Selfie_Dad> no not really
19:58:26 <Selfie_Dad> this is like heavy duty stuff 8mm strong tile
19:58:37 <Selfie_Dad> u can get horse stall mats at tractor supply 
19:58:39 <Selfie_Dad> which a lot of people use
19:58:52 <Selfie_Dad> but apparently they stink like hell so you have to leave them outside to offgas for like a week
19:59:11 <scoop_jackson> Buy your farming equipment bow imo
19:59:14 <scoop_jackson> Now
19:59:37 <Nude_Riker> my parents have a like 10x10ft 1.5cm thick mat for working out and it rocks
20:00:06 <Nude_Riker> maybe thicker, very sturdy
20:00:07 <mpg> back at the house i grew up in my brother had a gym and it was just carpeted
20:00:15 <mpg> leftover carpeting from other rooms in the house
20:02:26 <mpg> Melber: i'll need your suggestions soon for places to stay in bmore when im there for mdf
20:02:34 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i have a mat rn but i need something thicker and able to take abuse
20:02:40 <Selfie_Dad> for deadlifts and stuff
20:02:43 <Selfie_Dad> dropped weight
20:03:05 <Selfie_Dad> damn im reconsidering this purchase for the time being then
20:03:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> imo just get the horse mats and let them air out
20:04:30 <Selfie_Dad> yeah that might be the play
20:05:41 <Selfie_Dad> but the weather needs to be cooperative
20:05:49 <bonegar> https://twitter.com/OCATCOfficial/status/1507031732712730631
20:06:49 <Selfie_Dad> i dont know if i can fit the horse mats in my car though lol
20:07:22 <bonegar> ever thought about getting a truck?
20:07:53 <Selfie_Dad> im not going to buy a truck to save money on flooring. what are we even talkijg about here
20:08:04 <Selfie_Dad> These horse stall mats' bottom surface is grooved to allow for the evacuation of liquids,
20:08:07 <Selfie_Dad> good to know
20:08:15 <bonegar> i was mostly just thinking people owning trucks
20:08:35 <bonegar> just thinking about trucks 
20:09:09 <bonegar> im talkin trucks
20:11:01 <Nude_Riker> truckin
20:11:22 <Selfie_Dad> yeah normally i'd borrow my brother in laws truck or something but
20:11:29 <Selfie_Dad> not going to do that rn
20:11:42 <Selfie_Dad> i guess some time i could stop by and see if it would fit in my car
20:11:45 <Selfie_Dad> its 4x6
20:11:56 <Selfie_Dad> rolled up i guess maybe that would fit
20:11:59 <Selfie_Dad> with the back seat down
20:12:14 <Selfie_Dad> but i'd have to buy 2 and make two trips i guess
20:13:52 <Nude_Riker> lol looking at the page for that ecosa pillow and one of the selling points is "adjustable height" by which they mean... putting pads underneath it
20:14:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> i posted screenshot from p4k about it antiracist_baby 
20:18:32 <Nude_Riker> wait a minute i just realized because im not hourly anymore i cant take a half day vacation lol
20:18:54 <letty> wtf
20:18:54 <Nude_Riker> in order to not burn the partial day i would be over i need to take a full day because it still accrues hourly
20:19:12 <letty> well done for being salaried though Nude_Riker
20:19:14 <Nude_Riker> but my timecard is only whole day allotments now
20:19:36 <Nude_Riker> ty letty
20:23:37 <Nude_Riker> oh wait i think my limit went up and i wont burn, but maybe ill take a day off anyway
20:28:11 <bonegar> i havent been sick since 2019, just realized this
20:29:31 <Nude_Riker> yeah same i think, like actual viral infection, ive felt bad but i havent been sick sick
20:29:41 <Nude_Riker> it rocks
20:29:54 <wild_ape-style_creature> i had the plague but i think that might be it
20:31:42 <Nude_Riker> i wonder if i could negotiate severance instead of taking all my PTO at once if i get a new job, i know people do that at a lot of places but idk if its possible with the university bureaucracy
20:32:36 <HellaBrad> cant hurt to ask
20:33:09 <Nude_Riker> well, it would hurt to ask before getting a new job lol
20:41:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have determined that this deck will be very fun to play
20:41:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> when i actually get to play it
20:47:00 <dreddybajs> i was thinking it would be cool to make 5 mono colour edh decks Homie_in_a_geod 
20:47:09 <dreddybajs> for newer people to play and try out the game
20:47:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> that would be cool
20:47:23 <dreddybajs> very classic themes, just like green ramp, black zombies
20:47:24 <dreddybajs> w/e
20:47:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
20:47:28 <dreddybajs> or green elves
20:47:42 -!- NORG [~NORG@synIRC-E2E297F7.tx.res.rr.com] has joined #phiz
20:47:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have 2 mono black decks and a mono red dragons approach deck that isnt actually mono red
20:48:00 <dreddybajs> i opened the pw from commander legends
20:48:03 <dreddybajs> i should make a deck w/ him
20:48:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> because the dragons that i tutor are not mono red. but all the other ones are
20:48:08 <dreddybajs> the bnlack one
20:48:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> which one is that
20:48:11 <dreddybajs> uhh
20:48:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh the one who partners?
20:48:16 <dreddybajs> yea
20:48:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> tevesh szat?
20:48:37 <dreddybajs> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/K2dyOfU7/image.png
20:48:38 <dreddybajs> yeah that guy
20:48:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
20:48:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> cool card
20:48:49 <dreddybajs> its wild he has partner lol
20:49:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> mono green lands is a good theme i think
20:49:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> with titania
20:49:22 <dreddybajs> i was thinking just like
20:49:25 <dreddybajs> yisan or w/e
20:49:28 <dreddybajs> that guys cool
20:49:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah that seems good too
20:50:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> viviens arkbow does a similar thing to that guy i think
20:50:51 <dreddybajs> yeah excep a lot worse
20:50:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> mono white edh is notoriously terrible
20:50:56 <dreddybajs> lol
20:50:58 <dreddybajs> yeah...
20:51:03 <dreddybajs> who would you even play with
20:51:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> brimaz
20:51:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh actually
20:51:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> light-paws
20:51:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> good new one
20:52:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> light paws aura/enchantment theme
20:52:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> with like sram, kor spiritdancer, daybreak coronet, all that glitters, and then i guess a bunch of pillow fort type stuff
20:52:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> for protection
20:53:08 <dreddybajs> enchantments are lame
20:53:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> card draw is an issue
20:53:17 <dreddybajs> and would be extremely hard to deal with for some of the other mono colour decks
20:53:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> maybe
20:53:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> you could do like lifegain too
20:53:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> lifegain/angels
20:54:00 <dreddybajs> oh yeah
20:54:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> you would also need to fill with pillow fort stuff probably
20:54:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> ghostly prison, authority of the consuls, stuff like that
20:54:39 <NORG> Hey everyone :) Happy thursday
20:54:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> Hello!!
20:54:46 <dreddybajs> hi NORG 
20:54:59 <dreddybajs> i would not put cards like that in there bc i think theyre not fun for new players to experience
20:55:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> hm i guess
20:55:33 <NORG> We all excited for race weekend?
20:55:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> trying to think of a mono blue that would be fun
20:55:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> you could do like mono blue wizards maybe
20:55:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> a mono blue spellslinger type thing
20:56:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> black and green have a lot of great options
20:56:14 <dreddybajs> my friend had kami of the crescent moon and tried to deck everyone with it
20:56:16 <dreddybajs> that was a cool deck
20:56:25 <dreddybajs> baral is banned right
20:56:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> most fun mono red i think would be kiki jiki which was the first edh deck i built
20:56:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> i do not think baral is banned
20:56:35 <dreddybajs> kiki jiki is cool
20:56:41 <dreddybajs> hmm maybe baral then
20:56:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> but idk if baral would be fun for new players
20:56:56 <dreddybajs> i mean i woulnt build it busted
20:56:58 <dreddybajs> or combo
20:57:03 <dreddybajs> just some counterspells and card draw and stuff
20:57:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> wizards with teferi mage of zhalfir would be cool
20:57:09 <dreddybajs> and make a big token to win with an x spell or w/e
20:57:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> hard to interact with though
20:57:32 <dreddybajs> lol i also think thats a terrible time for new players
20:57:37 <dreddybajs> being told theyre not allowed to do cool stuff 
20:57:51 <Nude_Riker> i saw a photo of the reddit baltimore F1 group recently and that killed any interest i had in going to a race party with them lol
20:57:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah i suppose
20:57:59 <dreddybajs> .g coolest mono blue commanders
20:58:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> you could go full mono blue mill with bruvac
20:58:14 <dreddybajs> oh talrand is cool
20:58:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> ooooh actually orvar and memnarch are both cool picks
20:58:19 <Nude_Riker> "party" by which i mean they all went to the same bar at like 10am
20:59:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> blue artifacts with urza is probably hard to do 'fair' but if you did that with like march of the machines as your finisher that would be funny
20:59:13 <dreddybajs> shuffling your deck a lot with urza seems annoying
20:59:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> true
20:59:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think im even using that ability on urza in the deck i just built
20:59:58 <dreddybajs> i guess you can shortcut and only shuffle the first time
21:00:07 <dreddybajs> unless something happens to your deck order in between
21:00:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah i think your group will probably be fine with that lol
21:00:21 <dreddybajs> that's an allowed tournament shortcut with mind's desire in paper at least ,i know that
21:00:24 <HellaBrad> wish there was a way i could practice dodging malenia's sword flurry without having to do the whole fight again
21:00:28 <dreddybajs> you don't have to shuffle between each copy
21:00:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> like i think the point of that is so that youre not able to do brainstorm/divining top tricks
21:00:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> or anything else like that
21:00:47 <dreddybajs> yeah
21:00:50 <dreddybajs> exactly
21:01:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> you could do a mono brown too
21:01:47 <dreddybajs> lol
21:01:50 <dreddybajs> karn silver golem
21:01:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> with like old karn
21:01:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
21:02:29 <dreddybajs> my same friend had a brown deck with the new kolizek as the commander
21:02:40 <dreddybajs> it was insane if he ever resolved it
21:03:28 <dreddybajs> i think against me he cast a turn 3 oblivion sower, hit 4 lands off the top of my deck, and then cast turn 4 kozilek
21:03:36 <dreddybajs> and just mauled the entire table
21:03:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think there are fun strats with this https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/FYjuzMdG/image.png
21:04:25 <dreddybajs> oh yeah that seems sweet
21:04:34 <dreddybajs> kills in 3 hits lol
21:04:42 <dreddybajs> there arent many decent commanders that can do that
21:05:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> when sydney and i play 1v1 we dont use commander damage
21:05:53 <dreddybajs> yea fair enough
21:06:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> it makes a lot more sense in a 4p game
21:06:05 <dreddybajs> i think it only exists to prevent lifegain being broken in the format
21:06:10 <dreddybajs> mainly
21:06:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
21:06:34 <dreddybajs> has sydney gotten to play any limited
21:06:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> i guess also to encourage strats where you actually use your commander
21:06:42 <dreddybajs> draft is so good
21:06:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> not exactly limited but we've played jumpstart
21:07:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i have a whole box of jumpstart packs that i put into resealable pack things for replay
21:07:19 <Selfie_Dad> butr
21:07:23 <Selfie_Dad> butt
21:07:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> id love to draft with her and other people
21:07:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> but its not easy to get 6 people 
21:07:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean i cant even get 4 people for a commander game irl
21:08:24 <dreddybajs> damn
21:08:58 <dreddybajs> it's very annoying to try and plan draft nights with friends ahead of time because, especially in covid times, someone will invariably drop out and fuck the numbers up
21:09:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> again this is why i need to do more dsa stuff irl. has to be the best way to meet magic players in nyc
21:09:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> unfortuntely the lgs that is by far the easiest to get to stopped doing live events when covid started and have no intention to start again
21:10:01 <dreddybajs> damn
21:10:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> there are others but they are hella far away 
21:10:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> real pain to get to
21:10:22 <dreddybajs> on a semi related note, seems like covid totally killed the irish fighting game scene apart from smash
21:10:39 <dreddybajs> nobody is showing up for any of the other casuals/tournaments and the guys are giving up running them
21:10:40 <dreddybajs> rip
21:10:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> someone tell phil
21:11:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> he can go over to ireland and easily become the #1 american player
21:11:20 <dreddybajs> i doubt hes played offline street fighter in a decade or more
21:11:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> hes still the #2 american street fighter player in the world
21:11:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> once and forever
21:11:50 <Selfie_Dad> .l
21:11:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> motherfucker ftw
21:12:19 <dreddybajs> i skimmed that line and thought you were fsr listening to this
21:12:21 <dreddybajs> .y eels motherfucker
21:12:35 <Selfie_Dad> no.
21:12:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> i should dm my friend i used to play commander with 
21:12:39 <dreddybajs> i used to fuckin love this album as a teen
21:12:46 <dreddybajs> what a weird band
21:12:58 <dreddybajs> Daniel O'Rourke
21:12:59 <dreddybajs> 1 year ago
21:12:59 <dreddybajs> This leaves me in a pool of tears every single time. I hope it never comes on somewhere out in public or I would have to run away.
21:13:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> isnt the guy from that band a real asshole
21:13:02 <dreddybajs> dont worry daniel.. it wont
21:13:08 <dreddybajs> idk
21:13:09 <dreddybajs> probably
21:13:26 <dreddybajs> i think his dad and sister both killed themselves when he was young
21:13:34 <dreddybajs> so, probably not the most together guy
21:16:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have messaged my friend to tell him we need to play edh again
21:17:38 <dreddybajs>  nice
21:17:56 <dreddybajs> he should also get a partner into it
21:18:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> new grimes just dropped https://pitchfork.com/features/rising/yeule-glitch-princess-interview/
21:18:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> cant read past the blurb on this. glaring at screen too hard
21:20:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/independent/status/1507022197012926468?s=21 dudes rock moment
21:20:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmao antiracist_baby check this out
21:20:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> Locked-in ALS patient also asked to listen to Tool ‘loud’ and ordered a curry
21:21:16 <dreddybajs> lol
21:23:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> He was also able to interact with his 4-year-old son and wife, generating the message: “I love my cool son.”
21:23:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
21:23:13 <Nude_Riker> the letter a minute rate is insane
21:23:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
21:23:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> 8 minutes to say 'tool loud'
21:23:31 <HellaBrad> hes got the time
21:23:39 <Nude_Riker> lol
21:24:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> Ukrainian band fighting in war ask Ed Sheeran if they can perform in concert remotely
21:25:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> videoconferencing into the ed sheeran show and immediately getting obliterated by a russian missile when they figure out where youre recording from
21:26:00 <dreddybajs> who wants to do discord watch of the oscar special this year
21:26:02 <dreddybajs> its on sunday
21:26:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> It took three months of unsuccessful attempts before a configuration was achieved that allowed the patient to use brain signals to produce a binary response to a speller program, answering ‘yes’ or ‘no’ when presented with letters.
21:26:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> christ
21:26:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> imagine the 3 fucking months of being fully conscious but with none of your muscles working while they just tinker around and try to figure out what youre thinking
21:27:10 <dreddybajs> i mean, better than the lifetime of that before this technology
21:27:55 <Nude_Riker> yeah
21:28:03 <Nude_Riker> having some hope there
21:28:16 <Nude_Riker> locked in has been my greatest fear since i learned of the concept as a teen
21:28:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> well i mean he has als and he progressively lost his muscle functions
21:28:29 <NORG> https://twitter.com/ScreenOffScript/status/1506734544602513411
21:28:30 <NORG> lets go!!!!
21:28:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> he used to be able to communicate by blinking but then he stopped being able to blink
21:28:45 <dreddybajs> right i mean the lifetime (until you die) after you lose all control
21:28:50 <dreddybajs> i understand what als is
21:28:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh. well, yeah
21:29:05 <Nude_Riker> lol
21:29:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> i thought you meant he was born that way
21:29:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> when you said lifetime before
21:29:22 <dreddybajs> it would be incredibly impressive to be born that way and develop a love for tool
21:29:22 <bonegar> jared leto as conor mcgregor is soemthing i would never have thought to think
21:29:28 <dreddybajs> lmao
21:29:31 <dreddybajs> is that real bonegar
21:29:33 <dreddybajs> noooo
21:29:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> the love for tool is within all of us from birth
21:29:53 <Nude_Riker> i was interpreting it more broadly just compared to other people who have been locked in for various reasons, until death
21:30:02 <Nude_Riker> all terrible!
21:30:03 <dreddybajs> i will say it's been quite satisfying to see the irish public slowly turn on conor mcgregor over the years
21:30:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> i forgot to close that p4k tab and i just went back to it
21:30:16 <dreddybajs> it's very bad tom, i skimmed most of it
21:30:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i think this might be the stupidest question and answer i have ever seen in an interview
21:30:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/SmzCInDV/image.png
21:30:36 <dreddybajs> lol
21:30:47 <Nude_Riker> lmao
21:30:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/poGNfTX2/image.png
21:30:53 <dreddybajs> i think when i was young i thought all artists like that were in some way smart
21:30:59 <dreddybajs> and now i realise that they can be incredibly dumb
21:31:34 <HellaBrad> do i not see the true ending of elden ring if i dont get all the stupid ring bits
21:31:38 <HellaBrad> malenia is driving me nuts
21:31:47 <dreddybajs> HellaBrad: no it doesnt matter
21:32:35 <dreddybajs> killing melania can stop you from going down the frenzied flame route if you already committed to it and want to change ending
21:32:41 <dreddybajs> thats the only impact it has on the ending
21:32:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> sammy guevara talking about cumming on the tnt championship belt
21:32:51 <HellaBrad> oh neat i didnt know that
21:33:10 <dreddybajs> lmao Homie_in_a_geod 
21:33:10 <dreddybajs> yes
21:33:21 <dreddybajs>  i was watching with the fgc crowd last night and we all lost it at that part
21:33:58 <wild_ape-style_creature> i heard that while i was sitting in my roommate's room and man
21:33:59 <wild_ape-style_creature> why
21:34:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> .gis rap and roll
21:34:21 <dreddybajs> it was a good show
21:34:24 <wild_ape-style_creature> i wasn't really paying attention and hearing that felt like i got punched in the head
21:34:57 <dreddybajs> i want another aew ppv... >:0
21:35:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> there will be one.
21:35:18 <dreddybajs> we watched the show then we watched some ibushi vs adam page match from roh
21:35:20 <dreddybajs> which was cool
21:35:34 <dreddybajs> kota ibushi ftw
21:35:40 <dreddybajs> ultimate aesthetic imo
21:35:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> the next big ppv is in may
21:36:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> its cool that kota ibushi still looks like he does at like 37 or whatever he is now
21:36:17 <dreddybajs> yeah
21:36:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> i want hair like that
21:36:52 <wild_ape-style_creature> .gis kota ibushi
21:37:20 <dreddybajs> his traps are insane
21:37:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think ive gotten any balder in like 3 years and i sort of wish that would either reverse or just like go all the way and get it over with
21:37:48 <dreddybajs> would u ever get treatment for it
21:37:54 <dreddybajs> sounds like it'd work if that's the situation
21:38:07 <dreddybajs> go to one of those turkish hair transplant places that instagram constantly advertises to me
21:38:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> i had a rogaine subscription for a while and it didnt do anything
21:38:27 <dreddybajs> going bald when i was 17 was cool because i was over it before i was really even an adult 
21:38:37 <ajj2> kota ibushi rules
21:38:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> i was recently thinking about trying it again but id rather save the 35 bucks a month i think
21:38:40 <dreddybajs> joe rogaine... anyone ever said that
21:38:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think that people have said that.
21:39:03 <dreddybajs> hes my fav japanese guy ajj2 
21:39:04 <ajj2> .g "joe rogaine" 
21:39:04 <Selfie_Dad> yeah they have
21:39:09 <dreddybajs> that said im not expert at japan wrestling
21:39:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> its kind of insane that no one has figured out how to fix baldness
21:39:22 <dreddybajs> the hair transplant stuff is very good now 
21:39:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> youd think that would be like, not extremely difficult
21:39:29 <dreddybajs> my friend got one and told me about it in confidence
21:39:34 <ajj2> hes one of my top 2 or 3 dreddybajs for sure
21:39:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah but its still prohibitively expensive for most people
21:39:37 <dreddybajs> and it was extremely effective
21:39:37 <ajj2> his matches with naito are so good
21:39:37 <dreddybajs> yea
21:39:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> at least in this country
21:39:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> it is not covered by any insurance
21:39:45 <dreddybajs> thats why people here fly to turkey or wherever Homie_in_a_geod lol
21:40:24 <ajj2> Kota Ibushi: ‘I haven’t watched tv in over a year. Haven’t played games lately either. If I turn the tv on, I just leave it on the HDMI channel with a black screen’
21:40:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> dont you need maintenance appointments fairly frequently on hair transplants
21:40:58 <dreddybajs> lol
21:41:01 <dreddybajs> ibushi ftw
21:41:07 <dreddybajs> ajj2: good jon moxley quote: You can compare him to any athlete in any sport. Hell, you can compare him to a bodybuilder. Look at the traps on that kid! He even has great hair. I hate him. I hate Kota Ibushi. You know how much work I have to go through for my mediocre traps and bad haircut? He’s gifted. 
21:41:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
21:41:23 <dreddybajs> Homie_in_a_geod: i dont know much about it but i wasnt aware of that
21:41:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> i feel that john
21:41:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> jon
21:41:38 <dreddybajs> Jhon
21:41:55 <ajj2> lmao
21:42:19 <dreddybajs> that said, moxley has been looking jacked n stacked since he got off the booze
21:42:23 <dreddybajs> good for him
21:42:30 <ajj2> this is another good one 
21:42:31 <dreddybajs> he looks 10 years younger lol
21:42:32 <ajj2> https://twitter.com/The305MVP/status/1493464644647751680
21:42:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> dreddybajs: i know theres some method that is newer and is like, visually maybe the best method up until that point, but you need to get it redone every like 6 months
21:42:46 <dreddybajs> lol
21:42:56 <NORG> almost all the kota stories are fake
21:43:03 <dreddybajs> yeah ajj2 apparently hes insane, and so rich that he doesnt care about money or his career, he just loves doing crazy shit
21:43:15 <ajj2> its crazy both jon moxley and jericho look 10x better than they did like 6 months ago
21:45:19 <dreddybajs> Homie_in_a_geod: that's a recent pic of my friend sam who got it done a few years ago, i have no idea if he has to get it redone though https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/3PYHWF05/image.png
21:45:22 <dreddybajs> he's on the right
21:45:31 <dreddybajs> i could ask
21:45:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> yea that looks very good
21:45:40 <Selfie_Dad> they missed the sides of his head
21:45:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
21:45:45 <Selfie_Dad> quite an oversight
21:45:54 <ajj2> lol
21:45:54 <dreddybajs> lol
21:46:06 <wild_ape-style_creature> lol
21:46:29 <dreddybajs> he was obsessed with it since he was a teenager though Homie_in_a_geod and once i shaved my head and said yeah i was going bald he would constantly talk to me about it
21:46:41 <dreddybajs> so im sure hes willing to pay top dollar for w/e he got done
21:47:08 <dreddybajs> it was very funny, he was super handsome/charismatic/popular and i was his one confidant about his Baldness Fear
21:47:54 <Selfie_Dad> lol hell yes https://www.instagram.com/p/Cbf-VStv_4Y/?utm_medium=copy_link
21:48:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> i definitely do not have the money that it would cost even if i really cared that much about it
21:49:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> i would like to have a full head of hair again but i am also not especially upset about it anymore. ive always kind of hoped that they would discover some fuckin miracle cure shit on the cheap
21:49:14 <dreddybajs> you got two options, shave it and get jacked, or go mad professor and also get jacked (mason route)
21:49:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> sydney usually cuts my hair pretty short which looks better than when its grown out a bit
21:49:52 <dreddybajs> imagining tom getting a genie wish, asking for a cure for baldness instead of cancer or w/e, and becoming a worldwide pariah
21:50:10 <Selfie_Dad> i want that alex trebek shirt but i dont want to wear something that might lead someone to believe i like the grateful dead

22:08:00 <dreddybajs> https://twitter.com/TheChrisForsyth/status/1506816695935160320 this is a very questionable statement, but in the replies there's an even funnier rebuttal where a woman says REM is the answer
