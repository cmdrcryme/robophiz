00:00:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> got two snake messages at the top of a long ladder ftw
00:05:09 <bonegar> .g energy star ceo
00:18:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> academy time
00:26:55 <mikev> i have just ordered a half rack of ribs, smoked turkey, and fried catfish
00:28:56 <NORG> wuzzahhhhh
00:30:13 <eric> .gis steve harvey funniest face
00:31:18 <Nude_Riker> no
00:44:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> so stressed out over preparing food that sydney felt like she had to leave the kitchen while i was putting food together because she thought she would make me even more upset
00:44:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> so in addition to taking all the enjoyment out of eating this is also making me a shitty partner
00:49:43 <bonegar> it's really hard to tell a person to calm down that needs calming down, but you have been working yourself up, and if there's any way to help
00:51:00 <bonegar> lots of things are frusterating but a lot of things you've been saying are ways of making those frusterations even more frusterating, and not really bringing truth
00:51:02 <dreddybajs> invasions are impossible in elden lol
00:51:06 <dreddybajs> it's always 1v2 or 1v3
00:51:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you're doing pvp?
00:51:47 <bonegar> lol, irish guy doesn't know how to win a fight when he's alone? >:]
00:51:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> i am saying things how i am experiencing them
00:52:10 <bonegar> yah, not denying that at all and i would be a bad person if i did
00:53:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> i feel like shit about myself and about life in general
00:53:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i also know that if i said fuck it and gave up on this i would feel temporary relief but then feel even worse
00:55:50 <dreddybajs> yea shrimp1989dspinfo its really fun
00:55:52 <dreddybajs> loving it
00:56:12 <bonegar> yeah you shouldn't give up on trying to improve your diet
00:56:38 <dreddybajs> Homie_in_a_geod: you need to find a level of calorie deficit that you can deal with without making you totally miserable, that's why will suggested going 2000 kcal until you get your scale at least
00:56:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you should take smaller steps instead of trying to go all out like this immediately
00:56:54 <dreddybajs> the important thing is to make it manageable long term for yourself
00:56:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like choose one or two foods to take out of your diet rather than fully reworking it all at once
00:57:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and yeah, cal limit should be higher
00:57:27 <bonegar> we all have different ways of doing it, i'd get very furious at trying to regulate my calories with numbers, but that's only because i've been on that rodeo and now have a pretty good rough idea about food
00:57:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah
00:57:46 <bonegar> i have to take a weirder holistic approach
00:58:31 <dreddybajs> i think tom will do well with calorie counting as he's a numbers oriented guy, but imo this is just too much at once
00:58:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> i’m not going all out like anything
00:59:14 <bonegar> sure dreddy it's a legit approach but there's real frusteration and anger here
00:59:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> it’s not even the fucking amount of calories. i could increase the limit easily
01:00:07 <dreddybajs> yeah fair, i mean i think this ties into a lot of your stuff about fitness and body image and stuff too tom
01:00:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> and then doing that i would still feel like fucking shit about having to dissect everything i eat into its constituent parts like some kind of fucking punishment for being bad at eating
01:01:05 <dreddybajs> well right but, theres no need for the former to necessarily be a punishment for being bad at eating, that's just how you frame it for yourself
01:01:24 <dreddybajs> im sure when you hear about will changing his diet you don't frame it that way for him right
01:01:29 <bonegar> is it the app tracking specifically that's frusterating?
01:01:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> it ties into all of that and as i’ve said before it is an emotional and irrational response to whatever my shit is about all these things
01:01:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> but knowing that doesn’t stop that response from happening or make me feel any less like shit
01:02:00 <dreddybajs> yeah i know buddy
01:02:05 <dreddybajs> and i dont think theres an easy answer to that
01:02:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> it’s every part of it bonegar
01:02:20 <dreddybajs> im sorry this is so hard for you tom, i wish it wasnt
01:02:29 <dreddybajs> but i believe you can do it regardless
01:02:41 <bonegar> yeah, i guess like.. i think there's some real legitimacy to your response is all, and i'm wondering of ways to sort of improve the approach 
01:02:48 <dreddybajs> and i believe the way to do it is smaller increments of better habits
01:03:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> anything short of taking some sort of magic pill that would allow me to live exactly as i always have but lose weight is going to make me feel like shit
01:03:43 <bonegar> the idea of doing data entry onto an app and then uploading it so people could make money off of my diet habits then feed it into some suspect metrics would probably get me to join a sovcit militia
01:03:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> something i've found that makes managing food easier for me is focusing more on exercise and less on what i'm consuming
01:04:08 <dreddybajs> agree shrimp1989dspinfo but tom also has these same issue when he tries to start exercising
01:04:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if i focus too much on what i'm eating i also get insanely frustrated and upset and feel miserable constantly
01:04:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> well i’ve already been told that exercise will not matter unless i am dieting
01:04:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's not true
01:04:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> also, when i say exercise, i don't necessarily mean like a strict lifting routine or whatever
01:04:36 <dreddybajs> exercise of course matters, it will make you fitter and healthier, what people have told you is the main way to lose weight is diet
01:04:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i ride my bike and hike for fun, which is also exercise, and it makes me feel better
01:05:00 <Melber> Metal shows are hilarious  https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/G8JKw41h/PXL_20220312_010413136.jpg
01:05:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean realistically at my fitness level (none) how many calories more than baseline being alive can i burn in a workout
01:05:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> the answer is: less than half of one meal
01:05:31 <dreddybajs> yes, the reason to get fit is so your heart doesnt explode
01:05:33 <bonegar> the framing of both 'diet' and 'exercise' in health media is designed to be frusterating in the guise of information to sell
01:05:36 <dreddybajs> it wont magically make you drop weight
01:05:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> building muscle also burns more cals
01:06:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> since it's getting warmer you and sydney can take walks after work
01:06:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> even that will help
01:06:08 <bonegar> like you gotta consume and you gotta move your body around or things happen as some sort of weird empirical fact i guess
01:06:27 <bonegar> walks ftw
01:06:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> food you can make small choices like usinga smaller plate or bowl and limiting your intake that way
01:06:41 <dreddybajs> im gonna play elden and chill on discord btw if anyone wants to hang
01:06:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> eating out a couple times a month
01:07:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if you just start with smaller portions rather than logging everytihng that still benefits you
01:07:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that won't take the fun out of eating
01:07:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> switch out processed stuff for whole foods
01:08:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> i’m sorry and i do not mean any disrespect in saying this but none of those things are going to work for me
01:08:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> have you tried before?
01:08:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have gone through this cycle so many times
01:08:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's not a challenge, i'm just asking
01:08:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh i see
01:08:57 <dreddybajs> also Homie_in_a_geod i feel like this is something you're gonna have to talk out with sydney if it's already causing friction
01:09:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> it always goes the same way. actively quantifying anything is the only thing that i actually feel like might work, but it is horrible and dehumanizing
01:09:25 <dreddybajs> she seems lovely and very supportive so i think that would be good to do, if you can do it
01:09:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah, maybe sydney will have some ideas that will work for you
01:09:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> we’ve already talked, it’s fine. she knows and she is supportive
01:09:43 <bonegar> real biological change does kick in at some point, and you do genuinely feel better and poop better after awhile
01:10:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i still feel bad that she felt like she had to give me space just because i was assembling a pizza and trying to log the pieces of it, knowing it was going to have me on edge
01:11:17 <bonegar> makes sense.. you dont want to be that
01:11:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> no i do not
01:11:35 <dreddybajs> well if you feel bad about that, you should tell her that, so she can acknowledge it and reassure you that it's fine
01:11:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have, we have already talked
01:11:45 <dreddybajs> because again im sure shes fully supportive
01:11:46 <dreddybajs> ok
01:11:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> since i first came in here talking about this
01:18:09 <bonegar> i think maybe the thing that stuck with me was you saying "I don't want to give up everything I like"
01:19:30 <bonegar> the only sustainable approach is finding new things to like, which is pretty much a life's work
01:24:21 <eric> I'm on Buss
01:25:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> show time?
01:25:31 <eric> I think doors are at 7
01:25:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh i meant like... time for the show
01:25:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> is that why you're on the bus
01:27:12 <eric> Yeah I'm going to meet folks first
01:27:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> nice
01:27:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hope you have a good time
01:29:52 <eric> I hope so too apparently I have mushrooms waiting for me when I arrive
01:30:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh sick
01:30:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you're gonna have a great night
01:31:02 <eric> Yeah i get a weird reaction form them sometimes but I had a good experience this summer so I'm optimistic 
01:31:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm not a fan of psychedelics because they make me insane
01:31:49 <ajj> who u gonna see eric
01:31:53 <eric> Gybe
01:32:01 <ajj> oh hell yeah
01:32:14 <eric> Sorry to hear they also make me insane but usually in a pleasant fashion 
01:32:19 <ajj> same
01:32:26 <ajj> i saw gybe once on a bunch of edibles and it was awesome 
01:32:41 <dreddybajs> hell yes eric
01:32:49 <dreddybajs> im so jealous 
01:32:49 <eric> Yeah I'll probably just take a cap and then vape when they go on
01:32:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i'm just too neurotic
01:33:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> had a really really bad trip the first time i took them
01:33:41 <eric> 3/4 of the time I do them I get an extremely bad headache on the come down
01:34:31 <eric> But in the summer I just had some tea and it was a good vibe no intellectual effects just things looked cool and I had a fun interaction with strangers on the beach 
01:34:45 <eric> And no headache
01:34:53 <eric> So I'm going to be conservative 
01:35:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hell yeah
01:47:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> .gis mr funky nut
01:47:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> sure.
01:51:30 <dreddybajs> imo eric you should get Very High

01:59:32 <this_fellow_kermit> looking at the new i voidhanger releases
01:59:39 <this_fellow_kermit> Thanks to an ambitious and intricate songwriting, a fresh and energetic approach, and lyrics ranging from H.P. Lovecraft's cosmic horror to Robert E. Howard's tales of sword and sorcery, THOS ÆLLA bring together the epic black/thrash of Absu, the elaborate melodic phrasing of early Cradle Of Filth, the progressive heavy metal of Hammers Of Misfortune, the creativity of DanSwano, and the aggressiveness of 
01:59:39 <this_fellow_kermit> death'n'roll.
01:59:45 <this_fellow_kermit> what it actually sounds like: gothenburg melodeath
01:59:56 <this_fellow_kermit> get over yourselves
02:03:18 <this_fellow_kermit> mr funky nut
02:12:01 <ehn> can check https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/sxlwg0pW/irccloudcapture6947819035925828703.jpg
02:12:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> cheers
02:12:22 <dreddybajs> nice can.
02:12:25 <ehn> Cheer's
02:13:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> not going out to show tonight
02:13:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> too depressed
02:13:50 <dreddybajs> the angry ostrich
02:13:54 <dreddybajs> sorry about that tom 
02:14:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh well
02:14:10 <this_fellow_kermit> https://i-voidhangerrecords.bandcamp.com/album/self-deification
02:14:13 <this_fellow_kermit> this is kewl
02:14:25 <dreddybajs> Homie_in_a_geod: i take it its too late for you to decide to take a night off and go blow off steam
02:14:29 <dreddybajs> bc of Brain
02:14:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> a night off of what
02:14:56 <dreddybajs> diet plan and such
02:14:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> and blow off steam in what way
02:15:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh. yes it’s too late for me to do that
02:15:15 <dreddybajs> i figured just asking
02:15:19 <dreddybajs> sorry pal, it' shard
02:15:23 <this_fellow_kermit> you should go to the toilet
02:15:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> also binging is not going to make me feel better
02:16:23 <dreddybajs> i did not say binge but point taken
02:17:05 <ajj> both my roomates have been doing the dieting thing last month and were experncing a lot of the same feelings you are rn tom i sympathize 
02:18:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> thanks
02:20:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> love too be on the verge of tears for no fucking reason
02:24:20 <ajj> my roomie said it was mad weird to be so directly confronted with how drastically your diet affects your emotions 
02:26:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean i haven’t even really changed my diet that much. a lot of days i completely fucking forget to eat. but then i’ll binge super hard on one day and like eat an entire pizza or something
02:26:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> it’s just like, having to break everything down and dissect it and turn eating into such a deliberate act when it had been something impulsive that i never had to worry about
02:27:29 <ajj> right, exactly 
02:28:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> and the underlying reasoning for doing this going back to the fact that i made myself a fat piece of shit
02:29:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> i said this yesterday but this has been so much worse for me than quitting nicotine was
02:30:17 <ajj> that makes sense honestly 
02:30:39 <ajj> but to your credit youve already quit nicotine which is a very significantly tough willpower challenge tons of people try and fail 
02:30:49 <ajj> n they say its like a muscle n all that shit
02:31:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> the thing is that like with nicotine it’s just not smoking (or vaping). with this, i still have to eat
02:32:07 <ajj> right
02:32:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> it’s not like i could have quit nicotine but still would have died if i didn’t continue to smoke smaller, extremely unsatisfying cigarettes and weigh them every time
02:32:34 <ajj> like when you quit nicotine your body starts feeling the benefical health effects of not smoking  
02:32:43 <ajj> but when you cut calories your body is just screaming at you 
02:33:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> my body has been screaming at me for sure but i also don’t even think that makes sense? like i’m even eating breakfast and lunch which most days before i wouldn’t even remember to
02:34:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> certainly not breakfast and i’d often forget about lunch too and only eat dinner
02:36:01 <ajj> i think bodies just get cranky at any sort of disruption or change and its most intense when youre first adjusting 
02:36:40 <dreddybajs> https://twitter.com/lesiavasylenko/status/1502331511890235395 lmao
02:38:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> nice try iris but what the fuck are they supposed to do with that.
02:38:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> grow up.
02:42:11 <dreddybajs> i hope most of you survive
02:48:35 <HellaBrad> honestly "i hope most of you survive" is a pretty nuanced take on the conflict for an eight year old
02:49:58 <dreddybajs> ya
02:55:59 <bonegar> wow im sure you're fun at parties iris, go touch some grass
02:57:38 <registered_mirc> touch some ass

03:14:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> glad he seems to have fared better than the guy whose neck i saw get broken at smackdown when i was a kid
03:14:44 <NORG> best case scenario for breaking ur neck but still a broken neck
03:14:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> that being droz
03:15:06 <NORG> owie
03:15:08 <NORG> i didnt know that lore

03:16:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> it was fucked up
03:16:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> it was also a dark match before the rest of the taping so there were like 3 hours of taping afterwards where everyone had to pretend that didn’t happen
03:17:06 <NORG> the show must go on
03:17:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> tbh i agree with the show must go on in that situation
03:17:31 <ajj> damn tahts wild
03:17:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> not in the owen situation though
03:18:55 <ajj> theve never showed footage of the droz accident but they used to show him being caried out on a stretch in their 'dont try this at home' psas
03:19:18 <registered_mirc> i cant imagine being there for owen hart
03:19:20 <registered_mirc> horrifying

03:53:26 <bonegar> having enough faith to cast remove poison in this game is so good
03:53:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i have that spell too but the balls are easier atm if i'm using spells for offense
03:54:16 <registered_mirc> i have no faith
03:54:18 <bonegar> play however you like
03:54:18 <registered_mirc> 6
03:54:24 <registered_mirc> and my arcane?

03:54:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm not trying to say you are wrong for suggesting this lol
03:54:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wish i could use it!
03:55:00 <bonegar> works well for me because i have a faith int build
03:55:18 <registered_mirc> are you using the night and flame sword
03:55:25 <registered_mirc> i think thats faith int right?
03:55:28 <bonegar> i havent found it yet

03:55:34 <bonegar> where is it
03:55:41 <registered_mirc> in the manor
03:55:55 <registered_mirc> its kind of in a weird place, i had to look it up
03:56:14 <bonegar> yeah im keeping my end str and dex up as much as i can, but at spoint but i haven't dumped enough to get the scaling benefits
03:56:28 <bonegar> can you tell me the rough area
03:56:54 <bonegar> Right now I'm using Great Stars
03:57:14 <bonegar> been stuck on the blood tooth for a long time but im gettin kinda bored of it
03:57:17 <bonegar> great weapon though

03:59:03 <bonegar> there looks like there's a sick ass thorn shrine build 
03:59:07 <bonegar> shrike
03:59:11 <registered_mirc> one sec i can look it up
03:59:15 <bonegar> there's so much in this game
03:59:35 <registered_mirc> In a locked room behind the gardens in the east side of the manor. This room is accessible from the walkways above. Begin at the Manor Lower Level site of grace, and proceed east across the rooftops, being wary of any spirit soldiers that may appear. From the first intersection, head north and continue down the pathway until it ends. There will be a rooftop on the north at the end of the pathway 
03:59:35 <registered_mirc> that you can safely jump down to, and from there you will see another lower roof to the north of this one with a ladder leading down to the ground at the center. Proceed down this ladder and you will find yourself in a small room with a chest containing the Sword of Night and Flame.
03:59:42 <bonegar> the thorn thing looks cool i think i gotta do arcane for that though
04:00:06 <mikev> very good line in this movie
04:00:06 <bonegar> oh cool yea i've been to that area
04:00:08 <bonegar> it gets confusing

04:00:39 <bonegar> da type of guy dat doesn't make assumptions
04:01:01 <mikev> "my mother was korean and my dad was black american"

06:37:57 <het> honestly this is something we should do here
06:45:40 <greatest_gamer> i live in the house of games
06:59:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> het: obviously i would be interested in this
07:00:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> just watched master and commander
07:01:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> the singer from venom played the ships carpenter in this movie apparently
07:01:38 <greatest_gamer> we’re driving to florida so i’m in south carolina rn
07:02:10 <greatest_gamer> michelle is driving but i will be taking over at some point so i may have broken my “i only take adderall when medically intended” rule
07:02:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> are you going to disney again
07:02:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> are you gonna be a disney every year guy
07:03:32 <het> are you gonna memorize the hacks to optimize how many rides you get to go on
07:04:08 <greatest_gamer> no i regret to inform you we’re going to universal
07:04:18 <greatest_gamer> because i really really want to see the simpsons stuff before it’s gone
07:04:35 <greatest_gamer> and there’s a new jurassic park world that’s supposed to be Tite
07:04:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> nice
07:05:06 <greatest_gamer> i’m going to buy so much garbage simpsons merch
07:05:09 <greatest_gamer> my body is ready
07:05:53 <greatest_gamer> nobody involved in this gives even half as much of a shit as i do about the simpsons looool
07:06:20 <het> lol that sounds great
07:06:59 <greatest_gamer> i have no attachment to it but i’ve been told the harry potter stuff there is really impressive
07:07:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> get me a bort license plate greatest_gamer
07:07:49 <greatest_gamer> i hope i can get like a stuffed animal but it’s lenny
07:08:13 <greatest_gamer> if they have bort license plates available i will do this
07:08:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> if they don’t sell bort license plates they’re making a horrible mistake
07:08:25 <greatest_gamer> cause they earned that bump like a mf that would be well played
07:08:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
07:08:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> i recognize and appreciate the source of your phrasing there
07:09:01 <greatest_gamer> i’m anticipating the merch to be mundane and not catering to psycho lifers like me but that won’t stop me

17:07:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> if i meet my weight loss goal that i am currently doing, i will be the lightest i have since i was like 20
17:07:36 -!- NORG [~NORG@synIRC-E2E297F7.tx.res.rr.com] has joined #phiz
17:07:59 <registered_mirc> i will never again be as light as i was as when i was 20
17:08:01 <mandarin_toni> i was really fucking skinny when i was 20
17:08:06 <mandarin_toni> i will never be as light
17:08:07 <registered_mirc> since i was grossly underweight
17:08:15 <registered_mirc> i was like 135
17:08:17 <mandarin_toni> skinny 20yo bros
17:08:21 <NORG> gm :) :)
17:08:26 <registered_mirc> mornin
17:08:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> i was 140 when i was 20
17:08:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> which at my height is not considered underweight
17:08:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> but my parents were worried about me because i had never been that skinny before then
17:09:09 <registered_mirc> i might have even been skinnier, i was very underweight and i did not give a shit about eating
17:09:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i was Large at 20 so i'd ahve to try pretty hard to be that weight again
17:09:20 <mandarin_toni> i was probably like 120 something lbs
17:09:23 <mandarin_toni> not sure how much im now
17:09:27 <mandarin_toni> maybe like 155
17:09:36 <mandarin_toni> all fat no muscle
17:09:38 <registered_mirc> it wasnt until i was like 27 or something that i had a real job and could get the foods i wanted
17:09:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i am in the 130s but idk my exact weight right now
17:09:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> similarly to now, most of the time i just fucking forgot (or could not afford) to eat except sometimes id eat an entire pizza in a day
17:10:03 <registered_mirc> im 160 now
17:10:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i also had a 20 year olds metabolism
17:10:07 <registered_mirc> round boi
17:10:16 <registered_mirc> yeah
17:10:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i feel like my metabolism is better now than it was before
17:10:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because i didn't do shit
17:10:24 <mandarin_toni> i spent all my money on cigs and beer
17:10:25 <registered_mirc> my metabolism took a nose dive when i hit 30
17:10:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i just sat all day
17:10:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> i also spent all my money on cigs and beer back then
17:10:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> i ate a lot of just uh
17:10:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> bread
17:10:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> plain bread on its own
17:10:51 <mandarin_toni> bread ftw
17:10:59 <registered_mirc> bread and water
17:11:03 <registered_mirc> the prisoner's diet
17:12:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i want pizza because tom mentioned pizza but i should not eat pizza 2x in the same month
17:12:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> i was like 140 when i was 20 and then when i transferred schools and dropped out after 1 semester and took like 6 months off with occasional community college classes while moving at home i very quickly put on weight and ended up at like 190-200
17:12:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> also it's shitty outside so i don't wanna drive
17:12:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i have stayed pretty much there ever since
17:12:27 <mandarin_toni> https://twitter.com/alethanity/status/1502679810883166217 the way this dream continued was that robert de niro shot me in the head but nothing happened because it was a "64kbps gun"
17:12:28 <mandarin_toni> goo brain
17:12:38 <registered_mirc> i think i was 180 at my widest
17:12:48 <registered_mirc> the peak of my drinking and not going out
17:12:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i was 170 as a teen
17:12:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> i like
17:12:59 <registered_mirc> at least when i went out i was like, dancing and moving around
17:13:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> must have a lot of bone or something
17:13:16 <registered_mirc> thicc bone
17:13:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> because like, when youve seen me mpg, ive been around 200 every time, but i dont think ive ever really looked 200
17:13:42 <mandarin_toni> would i enjoy war on drugs play at a hockey arena
17:13:44 <registered_mirc> you did not tom
17:13:46 <registered_mirc> i assure you of that
17:13:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> i feel like people would probably assume from looking at me that i was like 170 or so (which is my actual target now)
17:14:07 <registered_mirc> yeah that sounds about right
17:14:35 <registered_mirc> i mostly only want to lose a little weight because all my good Medium shirts are kinda tight now
17:14:45 <registered_mirc> otherwise i do not give a shit
17:14:48 <mandarin_toni> mid
17:14:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> the last few times ive gone to the doctor theyve basically been like '...well you are definitely heavy but you are also healthy'
17:15:04 <registered_mirc> that's good
17:15:13 <registered_mirc> being heavy is not a bad thing unless you're into fat shaming
17:15:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean it makes me feel bad and i have definitely put on some extra since the holidays
17:15:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> hence me trying to lose weight now
17:17:45 <eric> I'm making toast
17:17:51 <registered_mirc> nice
17:17:55 <registered_mirc> i had toast this morn
17:18:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> this was right about at my lightest which honestly i dont think looks that horribly different from how i do now https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/GNebq7qf/image.png
17:18:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i was wearing size s tees back then and my jeans were like 30 waist as opposed to 34 now
17:18:39 <registered_mirc> ugh yeah
17:18:41 <registered_mirc> it's horrible
17:18:43 <registered_mirc> sorry
17:18:47 <registered_mirc> horribly different
17:18:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol is it
17:19:02 <registered_mirc> of course not
17:19:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
17:19:29 <registered_mirc> even if it was different i wouldnt ever say it was horrible
17:19:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> that was also my first time in chicago
17:19:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> fun fact
17:19:36 <registered_mirc> oh what up
17:19:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh wait no it wasnt
17:19:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> 2nd
17:19:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> first time was p4k 2007
17:19:52 <registered_mirc> anderson is gonna be here this year
17:19:52 <bonegar> anyone know anything about xbox controller mods
17:19:57 <bonegar> i basically only have to replace this button
17:20:07 <the`shima> fat distribution and shit is totally personal and i think sometimes you can hide weight well, suddenly look like you got fat, etc. id probably not worry about visual aspects too much unless its bothering you
17:20:36 <the`shima> if i started putting lbs on in goes to my legs nad i dont get much of a gut till a bit later so it takes me a while to notice lol
17:20:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> eh i mean its been bothering me for years

17:21:50 <registered_mirc> you cant really tell how skinny i am here i dont think but

17:21:56 <registered_mirc> i was 27 i think
17:21:59 <registered_mirc> lookin real stupid
17:22:15 <registered_mirc> cutting my own hair too
17:22:18 <the_chasteful_turd> i was fat as shit when i was 20
17:22:40 <the`shima> speaking of fat i cant stop watching clips from my 600lb life
17:22:42 <the`shima> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TadDsJRWXMk
17:23:44 <the`shima> its kinda weird watching the show cause i dont have much sympathy for a lot of the people on there. like they obviously have really awful mental health problems and stuff but a lot of them treat people around them like shit, skip therapy sessions, etc
17:24:07 <the`shima> a lot of really manipulative people basically
17:24:19 <registered_mirc> self-awareness is hard.
17:24:52 <registered_mirc> but that's the cycle of abuse
17:24:58 <bonegar> i dont know how people get like that, but you cant get like that alone i'd think
17:25:14 <the`shima> dr now rules however
17:25:14 <registered_mirc> yeah you can't
17:25:33 <registered_mirc> you need people around you who are abusing you as much as you are abusing them and yourself probably
17:26:34 <the`shima> ya
17:29:39 <bonegar> trying to skim through reviews to figure out how to buy a part that wont be total trash
17:34:22 <scoop_jackson> Someone gifted my friends 3yo daughter this gift
17:34:25 <scoop_jackson> https://www.amazon.com/AntiRacist-Baby-Ibram-X-Kendi/dp/0593110412
17:35:01 <scoop_jackson> It is absurd to think that a 3yo would get anything out of this book
17:35:04 <eric> lol
17:35:06 <registered_mirc> lol
17:35:24 <eric> https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lfEvNwRGL.jpg 3 yo declaring their racist ideas
17:36:00 <registered_mirc> ahh confession
17:36:57 <the_chasteful_turd> lol I saw that last year nic
17:37:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> did you buy anti-racist baby for ollie
17:37:17 <the_chasteful_turd> .gis baby saying the n word
17:37:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao at that result
17:37:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> damn google is racist :/
17:38:14 <registered_mirc> what was the thing where google was returning results with images of monkeys
17:38:25 <mikev> This mfer needs to clear out of the DL platform
17:38:43 <mikev> It’s been over 30 minutes
17:38:47 <the_chasteful_turd> go show him whats up
17:39:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wasn't it when you just searched for black people or something
17:39:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so they kneecapped their entire image search function
17:39:13 <mandarin_toni> if you give a baby an apple and a black baby, which one is it going to eat? exactly
17:40:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what happens when i confess to racism
17:40:13 <registered_mirc> God forgives you
17:40:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> can i be racist again after that
17:40:28 <registered_mirc> and jesus gives you a hug
17:40:30 <registered_mirc> yes
17:40:35 <registered_mirc> but then you have to confess again
17:40:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hell yeah
17:40:50 <registered_mirc> but it's cool because you will just continue to get hugs if you keep confessing
17:40:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> a good incentive for being racist
17:41:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i will continue
17:41:10 <mandarin_toni> .l

17:53:09 <mikev> Resist streaming embrace downloading…
17:53:26 <eric> this seasons good so far
17:53:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> agree generally but my stories don't get posted on torrent sites all the time
17:53:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like, they can be found on usenet i guess? but not public torrent trackers
17:53:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so i just stream the unimportant stuff
17:54:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i dl movies usually though
17:54:03 <eric> yueah its whatever
17:54:14 <eric> id rather download but beggers cant be choosers
17:54:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ^
17:54:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i support all forms of piracy even if streaming is inferior to downloading
17:55:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> top chef (the ch is the same as in choose)
17:55:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't like padma's bangs in the opening
17:55:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they make her look much older
17:58:17 <eric> its crazy how young she looks
17:59:04 <eric> i mean shes not like an old lady but still she is very youthful for her age
17:59:27 <eric> whereas tom is looking more and more like a potato in a sweater
17:59:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol yeah
17:59:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it doesn't seem like she gets much work done either
17:59:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> probably botox here and there but nothing too invasive
18:00:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> she's 51
18:00:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i would assume early 40s
18:00:41 <eric> yeah yeah 
18:00:44 <eric> oops
18:00:52 <eric> i had already typed it and then i typed it again
18:00:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol

18:01:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah maybe i'll go this evening after all
18:02:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm cooking vegetables right now though and i'm very hungry so maybe eating will change my mind
18:02:21 <mandarin_toni>  <eric> whereas tom is looking more and more like a potato in a sweater <<< alright bro hes feeling bad enough already
18:02:28 <eric> lol
18:02:35 <het> lol

18:03:00 <eric> .gis onion in a sweater
18:03:05 <het> shrimp1989dspinfo: yeah my friend and I were talking about how thankfully padma only had bangs in the intro and not in the episodes
18:03:10 <het> because they do not look great
18:03:11 <eric> ?
18:03:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wonder why she did that
18:03:40 <eric> temporary lapse of judgement
18:03:45 <eric> it can happen to the best of us
18:04:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> true
18:08:12 <eric> damn my boots are already ready

19:20:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> they shouldve carried Turtle Pleasure
19:20:07 <registered_mirc> from games rock also because they're as much about exploring as being good

19:22:46 <mikev> RIP amari, NORG...
19:22:56 <NORG> enjoy cleveland

19:24:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> animal free dairy ice cream is peter approved https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/Gg8w1j5E/20220312_142201.jpg
19:25:04 <registered_mirc> peter peter ice cream eater
19:25:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he goes to town on regular veg ice cream so i don't really think he cares about what it's made from
19:26:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i only had a couple spoons of it but i don't remember what the consistency of normal ice cream is like
19:26:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my roommate says it's pretty close
19:27:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> do you have... Shaw Naw Naw
19:27:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> or     HEEE haw
19:28:41 <eric> roommate tested peter approved
19:29:09 <eric> .g kid tested mother approved
19:29:14 <eric> oh yeah
19:29:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when i took the ice cream into his room peter was chasing after me screaming the whole time
19:29:24 <registered_mirc> kix is good af
19:29:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah kix was my preferred cereal style as a child
19:29:56 <eric> i dont think i ever had it
19:30:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> berry cereal but not too sweet iirc
19:30:24 <registered_mirc> kix was just lightly sweetened rice spheres
19:30:29 <registered_mirc> but they had a berry one too maybe
19:30:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> berry kix specifically wsa the one i ate
19:30:48 <bonegar> do people still eat cereal
19:30:50 <registered_mirc> ahh i never had it
19:30:51 <eric> In 1947, Kix offered a Lone Ranger atomic bomb ring in exchange for a box top and 15 cents.[6] The ring contained a spinthariscope, so that when the red base (which served as a "secret message compartment") was taken off, and after a period of time for dark adaptation, you could look through a small plastic lens at scintillations caused by polonium alpha particles striking a zinc sulfide screen.[7]
19:30:55 <eric> cool
19:30:55 <registered_mirc> i eat cereal all of the time
19:31:01 <eric> cereal rocks
19:31:14 <eric> i got a box of cinnimon toast crucnh recently
19:31:18 <eric> and it was very good stuff
19:31:22 <registered_mirc> i hav ehoney bunches of oats currently, and i finished a box of cinnamon toast crunch last week
19:31:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i eat the tjs version of cinnamon toast crunch but that's about it
19:31:31 <bonegar> it just kinda vanished from my life one day and never returned
19:31:39 <registered_mirc> bring it back imho
19:31:44 <registered_mirc> it's the best
19:31:45 <eric> i rarely eat it it was a treat 
19:31:55 <eric> but i like it
19:31:57 <bonegar> im not sure if i should bring it back
19:32:03 <eric> kind of like a bag of chips or box of cookies or whatever
19:32:06 <bonegar> not saying it isn't good
19:32:14 <bonegar> yea
19:32:14 <registered_mirc> when im gaming work working and i can't be fucked to think about making food, cereal does the job
19:32:18 <bonegar> definitely like bag of chips
19:32:45 <bonegar> its hard to get good chips these days
19:32:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> im looking at old pics on fb
19:32:57 <registered_mirc> doritos are pretty easy to get
19:32:57 <eric> theyve got good chips in canada
19:33:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i found a pic where i look the fuckin frattiest i ever looked in my life
19:33:06 <eric> let see
19:33:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/0yLUiRjA/image.png
19:33:13 <registered_mirc> and we've got jay's here in illinois, always very plentiful
19:33:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> all dressed chip
19:33:15 <bonegar> i used to like those lays salt and vinegar chips, but they changed the chip style to be like idk, compressed from powder
19:33:22 <eric> bro mode
19:33:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> dressed all over and zesty mordant
19:33:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think the only dorito style chip flavor i can eat is the thai chili one but i like it
19:33:37 <bonegar> never seen that
19:33:45 <registered_mirc> i like spicy nacho exclusively
19:33:46 <eric> sweet chili heat ftw
19:33:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's called like sweet chili heat now
19:33:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah
19:33:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> idk why they changed the name
19:33:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it was thai chili for at least a year
19:33:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> i like most doritos
19:33:59 <bonegar> this is gonna sound messed up, so i apologize in advance but...
19:34:02 <eric> to make it less ethnic i guess
19:34:03 <bonegar> i like the taco dorito
19:34:06 <registered_mirc> the sweet chili is good tho, but spicy nacho is an invenerable staple
19:34:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah its good
19:34:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> theyre all good
19:34:14 <bonegar> but i never see them anymore
19:34:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> cool ranch? its good
19:34:17 <bonegar> lost to time
19:34:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/56yqPYfK/image.png
19:34:24 <eric> cool ranch is a good one
19:34:24 <bonegar> ya cool ranch is good
19:34:27 <registered_mirc> what came first..... ranch.... or cool ranch....
19:34:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> there used to be a cheeseburger dorito too
19:34:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> do you remember when, in the 90s, the nacho cheese doritos were called Nacho Cheesier
19:34:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh i guess it was "limited edition" but they just changed the name and made it permanent
19:34:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> and the cool ranch were called Cooler Ranch
19:34:52 <registered_mirc> yes toim
19:34:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i rememeber cooler ranch
19:34:57 <bonegar> are they still not called that?
19:35:08 <registered_mirc> i also remember, in the summer of 1995, i basically lived on Pizza Hut doritos and Jolt
19:35:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> i thought those were just what they were called forever, i never realized they discontinued those names and went back to just nacho cheese and cool ranch
19:35:18 <eric> were working through a ba g of these rn https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/RbyP7n5H/image.png
19:35:19 <eric> theyre good
19:35:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> until like many years later
19:35:26 <eric> sweet bean flavour
19:35:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> rip pizza hut doritos
19:35:30 <registered_mirc> yeah
19:35:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> i drank a lot of fuckin Surge back then
19:35:43 <registered_mirc> pizza hut doritos were the zenith of doritos for me
19:36:08 <bonegar> do they still have the taco bell dorito tacos
19:36:14 <eric> i think so
19:36:18 <registered_mirc> damn do they
19:36:23 <registered_mirc> i should fuck with that
19:36:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like the weird taiwanese lays i get at Asian Food
19:36:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they have cool flavors
19:36:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think i can ever eat chips again
19:36:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> some of them have milk so i can't eat them but plenty of them do not
19:36:47 <eric> asian snacks ftw
19:36:52 <registered_mirc> i always want to like that stuff but my palate is Extremely American
19:37:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/MuWqQONN/image.png
19:37:23 <registered_mirc> i like plenty of not american food but it's always the center of which i relate flavors
19:37:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i grew up eating not american food so i got lucky i guess
19:37:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> i just thought of a good photoshop to make
19:38:50 <the_chasteful_turd> eating new kind of chex mix
19:38:54 <the_chasteful_turd> white cheddar
19:38:58 <eric> the msot exotic thing we ate growning up  was sushi 
19:39:05 <eric> i didnt have thai food until i was like 17
19:39:05 <the_chasteful_turd> not bad
19:39:09 <eric> or pho
19:39:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that
19:39:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> s childhood food for me
19:39:24 <registered_mirc> yeah i didnt have sushi until i was in my late 20s
19:39:46 <registered_mirc> i had thai food before that and i like red or yellow or panang curry
19:39:52 <registered_mirc> and most of the fried appetizers
19:40:21 <registered_mirc> we had chinese food a lot becuase that's what jewish families eat on christian holidays when everything else is closed
19:40:23 <eric> but now i probably eat asian food more often than not
19:40:33 <registered_mirc> but it was kinda basic chinese food, not like Authentic
19:40:49 <registered_mirc> or, it was authentic i don't know

20:19:15 <mikev> jeez
20:19:21 <registered_mirc> lol gonna just keep going down until it's optimized
20:19:41 <registered_mirc> kinda ready for dist to move on to all rememberances tho, any% is kinda boring
20:20:33 <registered_mirc> like its sick how all the strats got discovered figuring out the pathing, but theres like 2 cool fights
20:20:54 <mikev> WR for 100% when
20:21:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> mike it's over for the avs
20:21:07 <mikev> does that game track % anyways?
20:21:09 <registered_mirc> that is going to take 30 hours minimum mike
20:21:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> celebration time for you
20:21:14 <mikev> why is it over?
20:21:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> landy out indefinitely for knee surgery
20:21:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> girard out four weeks
20:21:25 <mikev> oh
20:21:29 <mikev> god how will they handle it
20:21:30 <registered_mirc> mikev: it doesnt track %, that naming convention is a dumb hold-over from super metroid
20:21:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> by playing poorly for a few games and pissing me off
20:21:47 <mikev> buchnevich out for a while for the blues so
20:21:50 <mikev> not like they'll catch up
20:21:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's wildly important to the team esp for offs
20:22:05 <registered_mirc> the world record for botw 100% is like 23 hours
20:22:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and if he's not 100% for offs we're even more fucked than we would have been normally
20:22:11 <registered_mirc> and there's a break in there so the runner can sleep
20:22:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what happened to buchnevich 
20:22:39 <registered_mirc> elden ring is way bigger so it will likely take at least that long
20:22:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we resigned francouz for two years at least (:
20:22:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's been great, i'm glad he's able to play again

20:23:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> 50 min of stellar hockey and 10 min of shitty refs
20:23:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it was fun watching an offs game before offs at least

20:25:36 <mikev> i can't remember
20:25:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no i don't think so?
20:25:48 <mikev> you will be the only person there to get rf5 on day 1
20:25:49 <NORG> ya mpg its the ds version
20:25:54 <registered_mirc> ahh ok cool
20:25:59 <registered_mirc> i have the nes game of that
20:26:02 <NORG> its the same story but ofc much different coz its ds instead of nes
20:26:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's harvest moon spinoff
20:26:16 <registered_mirc> the first 4 dragon warrior games are very good
20:26:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> maybe i won'
20:26:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> t be
20:26:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think steve might get it...
20:26:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i know someone who preordered
20:26:34 <NORG> tell'em steve dave
20:26:35 <mikev> i thought he didn't leave the house

20:27:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> generally rf/hm games come with physical preorder bonuses
20:27:15 <NORG> cow statue
20:27:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this one sucks so i didn't get it
20:27:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but usually it's a cute plush

20:27:49 <NORG> skimping on materials

20:28:46 <mikev> plush keychain seems so annoying to me
20:28:52 <mikev> lets make my keys even bigger than they already are
20:28:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah
20:29:18 <registered_mirc> wouldnt used that as an actual keychain

20:29:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/GiS1sBai/image.png
20:30:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they should have just made a full wooly plush

20:31:51 <registered_mirc> fuck it
20:32:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hell yeah
20:32:19 <NORG> 1 of my speedrun friends turned into a touhou plush obsessive
20:32:32 <NORG> tweets about them as if theyre people
20:32:35 <mikev> cool person
20:32:37 <registered_mirc> lol
20:32:42 <mikev> what kinda pizza and from where mpg
20:32:53 <mikev> most of the pizza i have had in chicago has been dimo's lately
20:32:55 <registered_mirc> i could think of worse personality traits than obsessing over plushies
20:32:56 <mikev> bc it's the only thing open late lol
20:32:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> idg why the touhou plush thigns are a meme
20:33:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> dino's bar and grill
20:33:22 <registered_mirc> mikev: i usually get cheap chain pizza tbh
20:33:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they're not cute plushies
20:33:35 <NORG> shrimp1989dspinfo https://puu.sh/IOiU0/bd464f2771.png
20:33:38 <registered_mirc> "local" places are generally hit or miss and depend on whether or not they will deliver
20:33:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you should go all out and get a fancy pizza for gamer saturday
20:33:45 <registered_mirc> dante's is probably my favorite local place tho
20:33:53 <registered_mirc> dante's is incredibly good
20:33:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wait are those touhou plushies
20:33:58 <NORG> Idk
20:34:03 <NORG> i just assume everything is touhou
20:34:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol
20:34:18 <NORG> they are
20:34:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> where's bonegar to explain the lore
20:34:41 <registered_mirc> i might just get jet's again
20:34:45 <registered_mirc> since it's insanely good and lasts forever
20:35:02 <registered_mirc> and it re-heats well
20:35:09 <alansmithee_> jets is really good
20:35:23 <NORG> theyre called Sukusuku Hakutaku
20:35:33 <NORG> which is touhou ppl drawing the characters as fluffballz
20:35:36 <NORG> and then they get sold as plushes
20:35:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh i see
20:35:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://eeveefruit.weebly.com/sukusuku-hakutaku.html
20:36:04 <registered_mirc> actually i dont feel like shelling out the dollars for jets so
20:36:49 <registered_mirc> i haven't had pizza hut in a long time
20:37:33 <registered_mirc> doesn't look like they do stuffed crust anymore
20:37:34 <registered_mirc> rip
20:37:36 <registered_mirc> that shit was good
20:37:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wtf... they took away stuffed crust??
20:38:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> pizza hut crust is too sweet
20:38:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but stuffing it is ftw
20:38:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> just get a calzone if you want stuffed crust imo
20:38:19 <registered_mirc> they might not have it on grubhub
20:38:52 <registered_mirc> i like a calzone but i feel like i gotta be in the mood for the form factor
20:39:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> calzone extra cheese
20:39:59 <registered_mirc> haha the fancy pizza place delivers to me
20:40:04 <registered_mirc> Pistacchio Pizza
20:40:04 <registered_mirc> Pistacchio pesto, Forno Rosso's special local sausage, fior di latte mozzarella, pecorino romano, basil.
20:40:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> time to get fancy pizza
20:41:15 <registered_mirc> they have carbonara pizza
20:41:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> new vampire survivors update is out
20:42:43 <registered_mirc> wompire
20:45:48 <registered_mirc> pizza ordered
20:48:54 <NORG> theres one of those damn things every other day!!!
20:49:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> true
21:06:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> new level is interesting
21:06:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> instead of enemies chasing you it's plants that grow again after you kill them
21:06:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if you run into them you take damage
21:30:01 <registered_mirc> alright i've been holding out because i wanted to make note cards today but i made a few so im smokin weed now
21:30:07 <registered_mirc> post pizza weed
21:30:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> for the salesforce cert?
21:30:59 <registered_mirc> yeah
21:31:04 <registered_mirc> im doing it this wednesday
21:31:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> good luck
21:31:08 <registered_mirc> kinda scared
21:31:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i bet you'll pass
21:31:17 <registered_mirc> like its not a big deal if i fail again
21:31:20 <registered_mirc> just fucking annoying
21:31:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah
21:31:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you've been studying a lot though
21:31:45 <registered_mirc> sorta... i have studied more than i have previous times at least
21:32:02 <registered_mirc> but im bad at like traditional study methods
21:32:34 <registered_mirc> we'll see, hopefully writing stuff down will have made more things stick
21:34:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> let us know how it goes!
21:34:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> can't believe you have to take it annually
21:34:25 <registered_mirc> i found out that the "upkeep" test is like
21:34:28 <registered_mirc> a million times easier
21:34:58 <registered_mirc> one of the leads said it took 5 minutes and was basically like a 10 multiple choice question deal
21:36:48 <registered_mirc> fine by me once i get past this bullshit
21:36:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh good
21:37:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it sounded like you'd have to take the same one every year
21:37:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> requiring a yearly test is stupid
21:37:13 <registered_mirc> yeah that's what i thought it was
21:37:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> good grift for salesforce though
21:37:32 <registered_mirc> they are making obscene amounts of money
21:37:46 <registered_mirc> the initial test was $250, and retakes are $100 each
21:38:05 <registered_mirc> for every cert, which they have like a bunch
21:38:15 <registered_mirc> plus their main services are very expensive
21:38:47 <registered_mirc> i can't believe they had a super bowl commercial this year
21:38:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> good god
21:55:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think the macro app overestimates the amount of fat in the meatballs we make
21:56:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> again i am at my daily fat limit after 2 pretty meager meals
21:59:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> its fwiggin snowing now
22:02:30 <registered_mirc> this is a sad cliff side message. Still no friendship... therefore jumping required ahead
22:05:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> same
22:06:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> if he only had a fort... night
22:07:25 <registered_mirc> my son is also named fort... night
22:08:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
22:08:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> tfw no maiden
22:09:51 <registered_mirc> found a hidden town??
22:09:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what is it
22:10:13 <registered_mirc> it's apparantly called Jarburg
22:10:23 <registered_mirc> had to drop down pretty far to it

22:13:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> it starts like this https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/E3oA0dII/image.png
22:14:02 <registered_mirc> no.
22:14:05 <registered_mirc> jesus tom lol
22:14:16 <registered_mirc> you know i just saw the rest in my mind
22:14:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive never actually watched it lol
22:14:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> but, i know what happens
22:14:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats plenty for me
22:14:42 <registered_mirc> yeah well you get the benefit of not having trauma
22:14:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wish you didn't post this
22:14:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> jesus christ
22:14:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> delete that post
22:15:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive seen all the other shock vids out there
22:15:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this is an act of aggression and i am forced to defend myself
22:15:12 <registered_mirc> that one is actually the worst
22:15:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> im sorry
22:15:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> bme pain olympics is pretty bad but its fake i guess
22:15:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> think this is the highest level i've ever reached in vampy survivors https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/Wg1DazwE/image.png
22:15:41 <registered_mirc> i mean i guess the actual worst is ones that involve animals, but in terms of ones that involve people that one is the actual worst
22:15:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> got all the chievos, time to stop playing til the next update
22:15:48 <registered_mirc> congrats
22:15:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> 167 is insane
22:16:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> also i thought i killed death but i didn't ):
22:16:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the pentagram evo is cool
22:16:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> at least the guy didnt die
22:16:14 <registered_mirc> i have gotten to: 12
22:16:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rip
22:16:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> seen plenty where people die
22:16:33 <registered_mirc> depends on your philosophy about death i guess idk
22:16:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> fursonally i don't want to watch people die
22:16:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> or get their bholes wrecked
22:16:54 <registered_mirc> me either anymore
22:17:04 <registered_mirc> at some sick point in my life i wanted to see the worst shit
22:17:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> [unconfidently] me neither.
22:17:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wehn i was a teen i loled at all the funyn shock vids but the two russian teens wailing on an old dude with hammers just didn't do it for me
22:17:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> im kidding i dont either. but i am pretty numb to all of it now
22:17:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> never been a fan of death vids
22:17:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm more squeamish now than i've ever been
22:17:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> injuries make me feel ill
22:17:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and blood makes me dizzy
22:18:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> i definitely get squeamish at a person like
22:18:01 <registered_mirc> ive re-sensitized myself which is fucked because thoughts are bothersome again
22:18:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> badly breaking a limb or whatever
22:18:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats actually the worst shit to see, for me
22:18:15 <registered_mirc> yeah limb breaks are rough
22:18:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> someones leg bending where its not supposed to
22:18:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> cant look at it
22:18:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i was in my roommate's room when the wrestle man
22:18:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> s elbow exploded
22:18:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i thought iwas going to throw up
22:18:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
22:18:36 <registered_mirc> ugh
22:18:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> it was really gross
22:18:47 <registered_mirc> that is very gnar
22:18:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> just thinking about it now is making my stomach turn
22:18:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> im not going to link it but have you ever heard about sid vicious (the wrestler not the bassist) breaking his leg
22:19:09 <registered_mirc> i saw that one
22:19:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no
22:19:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> frankly i don't want to know any more about it
22:19:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's enough for me
22:19:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> ok
22:19:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hey remember rotten dot com
22:19:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> suffice to say its not pleasant
22:19:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> remember uhh... ogrish
22:19:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> or wahtever the hell
22:19:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> of course we do
22:19:40 <registered_mirc> unfortunately lol
22:19:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my dad would like
22:19:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wake up and log on to rotten dot com first thing in the morning
22:19:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i wasn't allowed to look at it
22:20:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> the funny thing about the sid vicious thing is like hes not executing a major maneuver of any type
22:20:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> hes jumping from like... 3 feet
22:20:06 <registered_mirc> jeez shrimp lol
22:20:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> maybe
22:20:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i get really scared when dudes get hit in hockey because i don't wanna see anything bad happen
22:20:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> your dad sure is something
22:20:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wehn mackinnon got his nose wrecked i screamed outloud
22:20:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it was CROOKED
22:20:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> that doesnt bother me for wahtever reason
22:20:54 <registered_mirc> my left pinky is crooked because im sure its been dislocated for 10 years
22:20:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if my dad was our age he'd be a prolific poster
22:21:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's a man born too early
22:21:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> probably my favorite hockey injury was when sydney crosby took a puck to the face and you could literally see 2 of his teeth fly out of his mouth on the slomo
22:21:12 <registered_mirc> because i was drunk and there was a pit at a noise show and i was in the middle of it
22:21:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wtf
22:21:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> NO
22:21:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> that ruled
22:21:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> NO!!!
22:21:31 <registered_mirc> lol
22:21:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i did watch the vid of the ahl guys fighting and the one guy's visor is just totally red with blood from his own face
22:22:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the guy who got his fingers lopped off or the other guy who got his throat slit, both with hockey skate blades
22:22:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> will NEVER watch those
22:23:31 <registered_mirc> aw these small pots are doing airplane arms and not attacking me
22:23:35 <registered_mirc> i like them
22:23:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they're just having fun
22:23:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> god i feel ill thinking about injuries
22:23:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> thanks guys
22:23:58 <registered_mirc> blame tom
22:24:06 <registered_mirc> he set this wheel into motion
22:24:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> sorry
22:24:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> phew
22:25:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> the 2 where guys got their throats cut are so insane
22:25:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when we first got maris she was still really skittish and aggressive because of her previous home life
22:25:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> particularly the first one in buffalo with the goalie, malarchuk
22:25:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and claire went after her once and i tried to scoop maris up
22:25:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> absolutely miraculous that he didnt die
22:25:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and maris flipped the fuck out because i approached her from behind and bit down hard on my wrist and popped a vein
22:25:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and blood was shooting out all over and i almost passed out
22:25:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i had to lay down
22:26:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and my roommate bandaged my hand
22:26:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i didn't notice when it happened because i was trying to keep the cats safe but my hand felt wet and i looked down and there was blood all over me and the couch and the wall
22:28:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> sheesh
22:28:55 <HellaBrad> thats wild, ive never a wound spray blood out of my body like that
22:29:24 <HellaBrad> glad you survived the defenses of this powerful feline, sounds intense
22:30:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive never really bled that much in any circumstance 
22:30:13 <HellaBrad> i would share my worst injury story but it sounds like its not something you would enjoy lol
22:30:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think the most blood i ever lost was from cutting my toe really bad once while climbing up a dock
22:30:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
22:30:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> share it anyway
22:30:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> it wasnt that bad but i do have a scar
22:30:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's not even my worst injury
22:30:57 <HellaBrad> when i was 3 or four years old my neighbor tripped carrying an ax for chopping firewood and kinda swung his arms forward to restore his centre of gravity
22:31:22 <HellaBrad> caught me right between the eyes with the blade and damn near lifted me off my feet
22:31:28 <dreddybajs> jesus
22:31:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh my GOD
22:31:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> damn
22:31:41 <HellaBrad> yeah my mom thought i was dead for sure
22:31:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> how bad is the scar today
22:32:00 <HellaBrad> still visible but smaller
22:32:20 <HellaBrad> it was cool when harry potter was very popular tbh
22:32:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
22:32:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you didn't see my rotten wound from a brown recluse bite
22:32:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm going to post it again
22:33:00 <HellaBrad> oh hell yeah thats what i need, my island apparently has those spiders in rare amounts
22:33:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/NOi1Vv8n/signal-2021-01-20-20-42-09-741.jpg
22:33:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this was over a month after being bitten
22:33:37 <HellaBrad> wooooooah
22:33:43 <HellaBrad> yeah necrotizing tissue is no joke
22:33:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i didn't have health insurance at the time
22:33:57 <mikev> grody
22:33:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but my mom works in an ER and a doctor looked at i
22:34:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and he drew a circle around the bite with a sharpie and said if the redness spread beyond the circle i'd need surgery
22:34:36 <HellaBrad> yeah, same as burns, it all depends how deep in the tissue it goes
22:34:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have three separate bite scars
22:34:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i was bitten three times within 1 1/2 months
22:35:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> each wound was smaller than the last
22:35:04 <mikev> what da fuck
22:35:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> which is really funny to me because i was developing a resistance to the poison
22:35:20 <HellaBrad> thats wild! stop wearing spider perfume mayber
22:35:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> idk where they were coming from
22:35:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it happened when i was in bed
22:35:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> every time
22:35:43 <HellaBrad> thats when they love to get you
22:35:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but the first time i turbo cleaned everythign and they still showed up
22:35:54 <mikev> whenever i get my own place that i own i will be investing in yearly pest extermination sprays
22:35:57 <mikev> regardless of cost
22:36:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
22:36:06 <HellaBrad> haha
22:36:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the only bugs i don't like are bed bugs, spiders, and ticks
22:36:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the rest are cool
22:37:00 <registered_mirc> roaches are not cool imo
22:37:09 <HellaBrad> "Dear DOW Chemical, I willing to trade you eight (8) years of my lifespan in order to never see a bug again"
22:37:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't want them in my home but i think they're ok
22:37:17 <HellaBrad> "please send me the good shit"
22:37:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like hissing cockroaches are sick
22:37:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like how big they can get
22:37:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> .y PeroxWhy?Gen

22:37:44 <registered_mirc> little fuckers do not pay rent
22:37:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've only had house centipedes and silverfish
22:37:57 <HellaBrad> and i mean sooner or later we're gonna have to start drinking cockroach milk
22:37:58 <registered_mirc> cant wait until i get move out and they can have the place
22:38:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> sometimes stink bugs get in
22:38:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and spiders of course
22:38:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> house centipedes are cool as hell
22:38:20 <registered_mirc> yeah
22:38:30 <registered_mirc> i like most bugs as long as theyre not on me
22:38:31 <HellaBrad> we have a yearly visitation of ants from roughly march to june-july, they just started showing up again
22:38:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they've come to say hello
22:38:59 <HellaBrad> they're everywhere but im getting used to the little guys, i just scoop em up on a finger and flick them out a window now
22:39:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i don't kill any bugs i find
22:39:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> except spiders :/
22:39:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> well i don't kill them, i have my roommate do it
22:39:31 <HellaBrad> very proud of myself for maturing to the point where i no longer kill spiders
22:39:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> spiders should not exist
22:40:03 <HellaBrad> its been a tough journey for me, a former child haunted by the eight legged freaks film trailer
22:40:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they were put on this earth by the devil himself
22:40:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
22:41:13 <HellaBrad> i remember there was a huuuuge spider exhibit at the shanghai museum of natural history and one of my favorite parts was just a big sign that said "STATISTICALLY YOU ARE NEVER MORE THAN TEN FEET FROM A SPIDER"
22:41:30 <HellaBrad> or something to that effect
22:41:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> nope
22:41:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm not
22:41:56 <registered_mirc> put down another cute message that i hope someone will see and understand
22:42:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what is it
22:42:20 <registered_mirc> visions of house
22:42:27 <registered_mirc> at the top of the caelid tower
22:42:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol
22:43:00 <HellaBrad> found another good one like that in front of a huge 12ft square empty cage
22:43:08 <registered_mirc> lol
22:43:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's my house
22:44:33 <HellaBrad> secret game mode where you settle down in elden ring and farm, little erd-junimos start coming out of the woodwork, you can hire fightjars to follow you around full of water for crops
22:45:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> please
22:45:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> dear god please i am begging you, give me this game
22:45:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if elden ring had farming i would never stop playing
22:46:02 <HellaBrad> putting on your armor and heading back out into the field to slay the 100ft Roc that has the blue feather you need to propose
22:46:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
22:46:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i never get married in my farm games
22:46:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm a solitary farmer
22:46:29 <HellaBrad> married to the land
22:47:01 <registered_mirc> elden ring farming sim would be a pretty great mod
22:47:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wish it was march 22nd
22:47:41 <HellaBrad> it'd be really funny just for like the playthrough vids you'd get of some guy beating the final boss with a copper hoe
22:47:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
22:47:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> farmer's hat, overalls, and copper hoe
22:48:17 <HellaBrad> would honestly really dig a big straw hat for my tarnished
22:48:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i was wearing a metal version of a big straw hat for a bit
22:48:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i got the burger king head so i switched to that
22:50:59 <HellaBrad> I do really like this one, i think on my next playthrough ill go muscly enough to wear it https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/RBqhRbrQ/bighat.png

23:09:30 <mikev> it already was legal i assume
23:09:34 <registered_mirc> mikev: it's like a private club and to be in the club you have to pay something like $2500 a month
23:09:35 <mikev> in that it was never enforced
23:09:39 <mikev> ahahahahha
23:09:40 <registered_mirc> maybe it's more than that actually
23:09:43 <mikev> that's so funny
23:09:47 <registered_mirc> it's fucked
23:09:55 <mikev> that sounds truly miserable
23:10:12 <registered_mirc> i was invited one time when i was supposed to do the frankie knuckles foundation website and their managment lead invited me and was like "yeah it's a total scene here"
23:10:17 <registered_mirc> felt gross as hell
23:10:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> 2500 a month
23:10:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the fuck
23:10:35 <mikev> do you get free drinks and shit?
23:10:59 <HellaBrad> im not sure i even pirate $2500 worth of media in a month? like it'd be cheaper to just buy it all
23:11:17 <registered_mirc> it's like an exclusive thing with a pool and all kinds of shit
23:11:30 <registered_mirc> but mostlyu
23:11:35 <mikev> you can have that experience in vegas for like $20
23:11:38 <registered_mirc> its about the exclusivity
23:11:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://twitter.com/eyeveaux/status/1502783241320906752
23:11:43 <mikev> minus exclusivity
23:11:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the song kicks ass just enjoy the music bro
23:12:07 <mikev> there is a corner of contemporary dance music that is filled with people like that

23:12:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i see that a lot surrounding ny shows i think about going to so i just... ignore it all
23:12:42 <registered_mirc> ok my bad
23:12:48 <registered_mirc> it's $2300 annually
23:12:50 <registered_mirc> not monthly
23:12:57 <mikev> that's 2300 too much
23:13:01 <registered_mirc> well yeah
23:13:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i definitely steal more than $2300 worth of media in a year
23:13:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i would never pay for a membership to hang out with a bunch of assholes
23:13:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> (no i never paid for an sa acct)
23:13:32 <registered_mirc> another thing that's weird is
23:13:41 <registered_mirc> in the pricing form they ask if you are under 27????
23:13:55 <registered_mirc> what da fuck does that matter i wonder
23:13:58 <registered_mirc> lets find out
23:14:06 <registered_mirc> lmao
23:14:10 <registered_mirc> people under 27 pay less
23:14:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you could simply lie
23:14:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what's the price difference
23:14:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> why 27
23:14:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> is it because it's the meme musician death number
23:14:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> age
23:14:55 <HellaBrad> seems probable
23:14:56 <registered_mirc> thats what i was thinking

23:24:24 <registered_mirc> what an expert
23:24:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> people naturally gravitate towards things that go up, not down
23:25:01 <mikev> where is the lie?
23:26:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh NO i had some hot sauce in a shallow dish and claire jumped on my desk and licked it
23:28:24 <HellaBrad> oh no! haha is she handling it okay?
23:28:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> she seemed upset for a minute
23:28:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> one time a stink bug sprayed her directly in the mouth and she lost her mind
23:28:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and made the absolute worst sounds i've ever heard come out of a cat
23:29:41 <HellaBrad> i mean, id make some pretty unusual sounds if that happened to me for sure
23:29:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol
23:29:48 <mikev> guess she just learned a valuable lesson about licking unknown substances
23:29:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> she definitely didn't
23:29:59 <mikev> something i also have not
23:30:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> she still tries to eat stink bugs
23:30:40 <HellaBrad> my cats like to spend a solid minute sniffing things before they'll try em, they're pretty picky
23:30:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> peter goes to town on anything he sees us eating
23:31:02 <HellaBrad> although Saturn will eventually nibble almost anything because he's a hungry boy
23:31:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's funny because he'll still eat stuff he doesn't like
23:31:08 <HellaBrad> yeah lol
23:31:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he'll make a face but keep eating
23:31:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he just eats it slowly
23:31:21 <HellaBrad> "i guess this is what i have been reduced to"
23:35:44 <HellaBrad> test

23:35:52 <dreddybajs> wow i completely missed Latenna my whole first playthrough
23:35:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ok now try
23:35:55 <dreddybajs> i just found her now
23:36:00 <dreddybajs> and this sounds like an important questline
23:36:01 <HellaBrad> alright
23:36:04 <HellaBrad> no change
23:36:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hm weird
23:36:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i haven't met her either
23:36:41 <HellaBrad> yeah like i said im not particularly worried it just makes me look like a dork who's never used irc before, which is accurate, so
23:36:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i had my irl initials in the name field at first
23:37:00 <dreddybajs> shes in a really hard to find cave in the SW of liurnia lake
23:37:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there's only one other person on this earth who shares my naem
23:37:21 <bonegar> you can fidn the caves on the map if you look closely they glow slightly red
23:37:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so i neve rput my real name in the name field
23:37:28 <bonegar> little tip
23:37:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh i've noticed those spots but never really made the connection
23:37:45 <bonegar> even though im benched >:[
23:37:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because i'm always doing something else
23:37:53 <the_chasteful_turd> name
23:37:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> get the new vampy survivor chievos
23:37:59 <bonegar> yea

23:38:29 <HellaBrad> hapax names are cool imo, mine is one of the most common names ive ever encountered
23:38:36 <bonegar> you can totally miss it and you gotta kinda look closely to find it
23:39:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don
23:39:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> 't like how easy it is to find my telephone number and address
23:39:56 <mikev> lol https://twitter.com/Kantrowitz/status/1502785481305640965

23:40:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol
23:40:19 <mikev> i think danielle is a pretty common name
23:40:22 <mikev> might be wrong about that tho
23:40:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my last name is not common at all
23:40:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the only woman who shares my first and last name is a couple years younger than me and she's normal and married and successful

23:41:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't think she has kids at least
23:41:57 <mikev> only one way to find out
23:42:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have checked in on her throughout the years
23:42:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> she was a pretty good volleyball player in high school
23:42:31 <HellaBrad> its a fun bond to have
23:42:46 <HellaBrad> whenever you google me you just results about a below-avg pro grolfer
