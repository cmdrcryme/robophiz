00:11:36 <eric> god damnint

00:11:58 <eric> its annoying when it goes up on the cliffs
00:14:15 <wild_ape-style_creature> the early dragon you meet?
00:15:33 <eric> yeah agheel
00:15:48 <eric> its easy i just dont do much damage and i make mistake
00:16:00 <eric> the hint for defeating is in the name
00:16:08 <eric> oh wiell maybe ill win tonight
00:18:02 <dreddybajs> wild_ape-style_creature: its just different i think
00:18:14 <dreddybajs> i think if you just want a solid ass katana uchi is prob better
00:18:36 <dreddybajs> you can do it eric
00:18:42 <dreddybajs> summon my new char if you wish
00:22:23 <eric> Yeah it's just a matter of time 
00:23:15 <wild_ape-style_creature> i got him by running around on my horse and whacking his feet
00:24:24 <eric> That's my main strategy too
00:24:33 <eric> I'd like to upgrade my dagger 
00:25:02 <eric> His attacks are very slow and easy to avoid but I still get hit pretty often
00:26:25 <wild_ape-style_creature> oh yeah i was using sword
00:26:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> dagger might be harder

01:47:12 <mikev> it'll be fun once you're there i bet
01:47:20 <registered_mirc> i havent washed my hair in a week so i like have to do that
01:49:42 <registered_mirc> https://dahliastear1.bandcamp.com/album/adrift-on-the-edge-of-infinity
01:50:45 <registered_mirc> https://cryochamber.bandcamp.com/album/adrift-on-the-edge-of-infinity
01:50:53 <registered_mirc> weird
01:52:05 <registered_mirc> bringing my bluetooth speaker into the shower zone
01:52:37 <dreddybajs> were now watching kate bush vids on vc on discord
01:52:41 <dreddybajs> if anyone wanna chill
01:52:45 <dreddybajs> you tube party
02:37:33 <wild_ape-style_creature> registered_mirc how long do you go between washings
02:40:54 <registered_mirc> wild_ape-style_creature: normally only like 3 days, but i have been very lazy about my hair
02:41:04 <wild_ape-style_creature> i do like 5-6
02:41:30 <eric> You tube party tonite
02:41:33 <wild_ape-style_creature> the ghost shampoo/conditioner has been a lot better for my hair than the stuff i switched to after my old shampoo/conditioner was discontinued
02:41:39 <wild_ape-style_creature> it feels much lighter
02:41:43 <registered_mirc> oh cool
02:41:44 <wild_ape-style_creature> ty again for the rec
02:42:17 <registered_mirc> no prob, i found it on some blog and frankly tried it because the name and branding was cool lol
02:42:24 <registered_mirc> but it turned out to be really good
02:42:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> verb is really funny
02:42:33 <wild_ape-style_creature> but i like ghost shampoo
02:42:37 <wild_ape-style_creature> i would be sold on that too tbh
02:42:41 <registered_mirc> i think of verb like
02:42:42 <registered_mirc> reverb
02:42:51 <wild_ape-style_creature> the only thing i don't like about it is that hte scent fades after like 12 hours
02:42:57 <registered_mirc> oh yeah
02:43:01 <wild_ape-style_creature> my old stuff lasted several days somehow even when i got my hair wet
02:43:13 <registered_mirc> i did not even know that was a thing
02:43:57 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah because i used the other stuff for so long i was confused by my hair not smelling like anything the day after washing
02:44:23 <registered_mirc> it would be cool if the scent could last longer
02:44:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah, i really like it
02:44:35 <wild_ape-style_creature> i was worried i wouldn't but it's good
02:44:56 <registered_mirc> i did not even pick up on the citrus until you mentioned it
02:45:20 <registered_mirc> to me it was kind of a subtle scent but definitely a salon smell
02:45:31 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah it's salon+citrus
02:45:39 <wild_ape-style_creature> this stuff is better for my hair texture too
02:45:52 <wild_ape-style_creature> my hair has more waves in it immediately after washing
02:46:05 <wild_ape-style_creature> the other stuff was kind of heavy and the waves only came out after a day or two
02:46:26 <registered_mirc> so this is like my fist time ever having really long hair so thats interesting
02:46:38 <registered_mirc> i put it up in a bun after shower most of the time to get it wavy
02:47:04 <registered_mirc> mostly i just want it to be as natural as possible
02:47:08 <wild_ape-style_creature> you picked a good product set for it
02:47:24 <wild_ape-style_creature> do you cut your own ends or do you go to a stylist
02:47:33 <registered_mirc> i.. have not cut it at all lol
02:47:39 <registered_mirc> i should but i havent
02:47:50 <wild_ape-style_creature> you should see a stylist and ask for underlayers
02:47:58 <wild_ape-style_creature> that'll give it more body if your hair is naturally wavy
02:48:01 <wild_ape-style_creature> thin it out a bit
02:48:35 <registered_mirc> my hair isnt naturally wavy i dont think is the thing, unles i maintain it as i currently do which has been to just leave it alone
02:48:45 <registered_mirc> when i brush too much it gets super straigh
02:48:56 <registered_mirc> well not super straight but like
02:49:20 <registered_mirc> https://www.instagram.com/xv_mpg_vx/ dumb face but hair is very straight in profile pic
02:49:50 <Selfie_Dad> buggo
02:49:59 <registered_mirc> mr. buggo
02:50:16 <wild_ape-style_creature> oh i see
02:50:43 <wild_ape-style_creature> i think either way seeing a stylist and explaining what you want with your hair would be good
02:50:47 <registered_mirc> yeah
02:50:51 <wild_ape-style_creature> texturing might bring out some waves
02:51:17 <registered_mirc> i have a friend i can see who is very talented too but i guess i dont wanna try too hard
02:51:22 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm lucky, my hair is very thick and naturally wavy so i can get a bunch of choppy textured layers for more body and wave
02:52:16 <dreddybajs> very handsome profile pic imo registered_mirc  :)
02:52:39 <registered_mirc> yeah i have been thinking about it and i want to make an appointment but its such an ordeal
02:52:48 <registered_mirc> everything is a trial lol
02:53:08 <registered_mirc> thank you
02:53:46 <wild_ape-style_creature> i've posted this photo here once but it's a good example of how my hair usually looks
02:53:47 <wild_ape-style_creature> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/9tq14Zh8/IMG_3312.jpg
02:53:51 <registered_mirc> tonight tho im going to the club like a metal goblin so im not doing anything to it 
02:54:01 <registered_mirc> lmao
02:54:04 <registered_mirc> good pic
02:54:11 <registered_mirc> good hair
02:54:21 <wild_ape-style_creature> ty
02:54:36 <dreddybajs> hell yea
02:54:46 <wild_ape-style_creature> that is at kings park
02:54:49 <wild_ape-style_creature> on long island
02:54:58 <wild_ape-style_creature> a massive abandoned psych facility
02:55:01 <registered_mirc> my kind of place to see music
02:55:16 <registered_mirc> damn i want to play in crazy places like that
02:55:23 <registered_mirc> pun 50% intended
02:55:31 <wild_ape-style_creature> it's a park now???? but they never demolished the buildings
02:55:37 <wild_ape-style_creature> there are shitty fences around some of them
02:55:38 <registered_mirc> lol
02:55:43 <wild_ape-style_creature> i ran into so many teens the couple times i've gone
02:55:45 <registered_mirc> its probably cheaper for them to do nothing
02:55:55 <wild_ape-style_creature> there's also letchworth village which is like... slightly upstate
02:56:06 <wild_ape-style_creature> another psych complex that has been turned into a park
02:56:27 <registered_mirc> need to find another word besides crazy
02:56:33 <wild_ape-style_creature> crazy is fine
02:57:24 <wild_ape-style_creature> this was at letchworth lol https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/7DrL150g/Screenshot_20220318-225700_Instagram.jpg
02:57:28 <registered_mirc> i would like to play an ambient show in an abandoned psych hospital
02:57:38 <registered_mirc> lmao
02:57:42 <registered_mirc> hahaha
02:58:08 <registered_mirc> sighing and unsheathing my green spray paint can
02:58:22 <wild_ape-style_creature> lmfao
02:58:26 <wild_ape-style_creature> i like that it says
02:58:30 <wild_ape-style_creature> we live in a sociey
02:58:33 <wild_ape-style_creature> and wy so serious
02:59:14 <registered_mirc> its perfect
02:59:33 <wild_ape-style_creature> there's an abandoned naval testing facility like... maybe 1/2 mile from my house
02:59:49 <wild_ape-style_creature> and i wanna go there and take photos and even scouted out the easiest way to get in but i don't want to go alone
03:00:09 <wild_ape-style_creature> one time i ran into someone while i was by myself and it scared the hell out of me and now i can't break and enter by myself
03:00:13 <registered_mirc> damn i would love to explore abandoned areas
03:00:49 <registered_mirc> yeah that's pretty dangerous
03:00:55 <wild_ape-style_creature> there were a million abandoned factories where i grew up because it was originally a well-off textile and manufacturing town
03:01:03 <wild_ape-style_creature> but all these companies outsourced in the 90s/00s
03:01:07 <wild_ape-style_creature> and killed my hometown
03:01:31 <wild_ape-style_creature> dupont had its own credit union in the town to give you an idea of how important factories were there
03:01:42 <registered_mirc> good old dupont
03:01:44 <wild_ape-style_creature> but my dad would take me through these buildings and later i was going on my own
03:02:23 <wild_ape-style_creature> eyah there's a high prevalence of a few very rare cancers in the area
03:02:45 <wild_ape-style_creature> a major medical university nearby was looking into it and concluded it's likely from the chemicals dupont used
03:02:48 <wild_ape-style_creature> really cool!
03:03:02 <registered_mirc> wearing my 3m dual filter mask to go exploring
03:03:17 <wild_ape-style_creature> i definitely have asbestos in my lungs
03:03:25 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm gonna get this midday commercial disease
03:04:08 <registered_mirc> well i hope that you dont
03:04:21 <wild_ape-style_creature> i like old building smell
03:04:41 <wild_ape-style_creature> it's definitely like... mold and asbestos and old concrete
03:05:12 <registered_mirc> i saw these really inspiring photos of this like abandoned and partially collapsed mansion
03:05:24 <registered_mirc> i should try to find them in book marks but i love that kind of thing
03:05:30 <wild_ape-style_creature> ooh yeah
03:05:45 <wild_ape-style_creature> i b&e mostly to take photos
03:06:05 <registered_mirc> it's the good reason to
03:06:11 <wild_ape-style_creature> i don't like when there's a ton of graffiti
03:06:18 <registered_mirc> also to meme and smoke weed in a strange place
03:07:16 <registered_mirc> whoever took this did some bullshit hdr or something to it but
03:07:16 <registered_mirc> https://miro.medium.com/max/875/0*7R23revRsjhqRNkk.jpg
03:07:41 <registered_mirc> thats not the original one i found before but its pretty cool still
03:08:25 <wild_ape-style_creature> god i can't stand hdr
03:08:31 <registered_mirc> yeah its so wack
03:08:45 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm sure the photo was FINE before they did that
03:08:51 <registered_mirc> yeah, its ruined now
03:08:58 <registered_mirc> and not in the cool way like the mansion
03:10:00 <registered_mirc> almost time to go
03:10:04 <registered_mirc> in the club before 11pm
03:10:14 <wild_ape-style_creature> nice
03:10:33 <wild_ape-style_creature> i want a micro four thirds camera because the shots end up looking like a nice film shot most of the time
03:10:58 <wild_ape-style_creature> and sometimes i'm in areas wher ei wouldn't necessarily want to load film
03:11:14 <registered_mirc> i wish i knew more about film and camera stuff but its not something i really understand
03:11:34 <registered_mirc> my new camera was supposed to be a 4/3rds one but i bought the wrong one
03:11:34 <wild_ape-style_creature> you point hte camera and press the button is all
03:11:38 <registered_mirc> it's still very good tho
03:12:20 <registered_mirc> i was trying to get a lumix lx-100 but ended up with an lx-10
03:12:26 <registered_mirc> still a leica lense tho
03:12:30 <wild_ape-style_creature> nice
03:12:36 <wild_ape-style_creature> i want a fuji micro 4/3
03:12:51 <wild_ape-style_creature> there are too many models
03:12:55 <wild_ape-style_creature> so i haven't bought one
03:13:16 <registered_mirc> that seems very reasonably priced
03:13:30 <registered_mirc> oh wait
03:13:33 <registered_mirc> my search is dumb
03:13:44 <wild_ape-style_creature> they are NOT reasonably priced lmao
03:13:47 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'd find a used one
03:14:01 <wild_ape-style_creature> not dropping 4 figgies on a camera
03:14:51 <registered_mirc> the lumix lx100 was recommended to me as a 4/3 point and shoot
03:15:02 <registered_mirc> "hard to fuck up" as i was told
03:15:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> .gis nut's nut
03:16:21 <wild_ape-style_creature> i usually search for camera models on flickr and scroll through the photos and decide that way
03:16:31 <registered_mirc> that's a good strat
03:18:29 <registered_mirc> time to put drugs from bag to smaller bag
03:18:39 <wild_ape-style_creature> don't spill
03:19:29 <registered_mirc> Very Carefully
03:19:49 <registered_mirc> doesnt work as well with no setup
03:19:50 <wild_ape-style_creature> you reminded me i have my big bag too
03:20:00 <wild_ape-style_creature> i think i forgot about it
03:20:44 <registered_mirc> idk how you like to vibe with k but tonight i had a good experience with headphones and a dahlia's tear album in the dark and it was a lot of elden ring imagery
03:20:54 <registered_mirc> elden ring influenced mind art
03:21:10 <wild_ape-style_creature> garage
03:21:14 <wild_ape-style_creature> lay in bed

03:25:17 <registered_mirc> this dude does cool experimental light photos
03:25:48 <wild_ape-style_creature> how does he set these up?
03:25:58 <registered_mirc> shines a laser through transparent objects directly to film with no lense, somehow
03:26:03 <registered_mirc> i dont completely understand it
03:26:15 <wild_ape-style_creature> whoa
03:26:41 <registered_mirc> Back to basics - A refraction pattern from a clear glass object showing just the natural refraction colours. Captured directly on to film from a single static beam of light without the use of a camera lens.
03:27:08 <registered_mirc> thats this one https://www.flickr.com/photos/alanjaras/12652655083/in/photostream/
03:29:23 <wild_ape-style_creature> that's really ocol
03:29:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> i want to see him actually set this up
03:29:53 <registered_mirc> yeah

04:43:17 <registered_mirc> margit, the fell doorguy
04:45:05 <registered_mirc> i saw pam on the way in and gave her my drugs because i thought that walking away and coming back would somehow magically get me in and that wasn't happening
04:45:12 <registered_mirc> my drugs got into the club anyway
04:46:06 <registered_mirc> well time to do more drugs and zone out to tunes

04:56:24 <registered_mirc> there was a short time growing up when we had an electric train set
04:56:39 <registered_mirc> and i would go through catalogs and look a model train stuff and imagine what i could build
04:57:45 <wild_ape-style_creature> hell yeah
04:58:40 <wild_ape-style_creature> i really like the smell of old model train exhaust
04:58:46 <wild_ape-style_creature> i wish my dad didn't get rid of my train set
05:00:28 <registered_mirc> yours was not electric?
05:00:58 <HellaBrad> i didnt even know non-electric model trains were a thing, that sounds extremely cool
05:02:04 <HellaBrad> i was into making model planes and cars as a kid but never had the cash or space for model trains, would have liked to get into them though. model train stores are absolutely nuts
05:02:08 <wild_ape-style_creature> it was electric but spit out exhaust
05:02:12 <wild_ape-style_creature> smoke oil maybe?
05:02:17 <HellaBrad> thats so cool haha
05:02:18 <registered_mirc> wild
05:02:32 <registered_mirc> i love the desire for realism
05:02:36 <HellaBrad> love those little details, model trains are truly out there
05:02:38 <HellaBrad> yeah
05:02:47 <wild_ape-style_creature> i want a model e5 but i have no room for it
05:02:55 <wild_ape-style_creature> if i ever own a house i will get one
05:03:23 <HellaBrad> the shinkansen? that would be so sick
05:03:26 <registered_mirc> ive thought about getting into painting fantasy figurines but i have too many hobbies already i feel like
05:03:41 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah brad that's my favorite train
05:04:00 <wild_ape-style_creature> fig painting is cool
05:04:18 <HellaBrad> its a good train to pick imo i think about it on a regular basis
05:04:36 <wild_ape-style_creature> hell yeah
05:04:39 <HellaBrad> i wish rail had more of a presence in north america riding trains is so cool
05:05:04 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah same
05:05:06 <registered_mirc> america is the classic like, we did it once and we wont be doing it again
05:05:10 <wild_ape-style_creature> i complain about this pretty regularly
05:05:36 <HellaBrad> i do too! i want to be able to hop on a train and walk around and sit in dining cars while i move several hundred kilometres between places
05:05:38 <wild_ape-style_creature> passenger rail didn't take off here because of auto lobbying and freight taking priority on shared lines
05:06:04 <wild_ape-style_creature> it's really fucking annoying when i'm on the train to ny and it has to pull off so the freight train can slowly pass by
05:06:35 <HellaBrad> it is a dream of mine to take a multi-day train trip and sleep on the train and also solve a mystery while aboard (optional but if we're describing the real dream that's part of it)
05:07:03 <wild_ape-style_creature> a cross-country trip would be neat
05:07:35 <registered_mirc> time for me to venture into the abyss, have a good night
05:07:42 <wild_ape-style_creature> goodnight! enjoy your drugs
05:07:44 <HellaBrad> sleep well!
05:07:52 <registered_mirc> thank you
05:09:23 <wild_ape-style_creature> avs win 5-3
05:09:42 <HellaBrad> whoa the sharks really turned it around, it was 4-0 last i checked
05:10:00 <HellaBrad> too bad they suck!
05:11:12 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah they got one in the 2nd and two in the 3rd
05:11:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> the first goal they got was a great shot though

05:58:20 <eric> well techincally third
05:58:55 <HellaBrad> nice work!
05:59:55 <ajj> very naiceee
06:00:25 <HellaBrad> did you use the special rock, the shackle
06:00:36 <eric> no i just cut him many times with my little knife
06:00:49 <eric> he doesnt hit that hard really if u got the vigor
06:01:05 <HellaBrad> the shackle is a really funny item it just squishes him to the ground like a bug
06:01:13 <eric> lol
06:02:21 <HellaBrad> good work taking him down with a dagger though
06:02:34 <HellaBrad> is it that bleed one?
06:02:55 <eric> reduvia
06:03:02 <HellaBrad> more and more people are saying this
06:03:12 <eric> bleed rocks
06:03:51 <HellaBrad> yeah before i started using moonlight i was putting blood arts on some of the cooler basic swords
06:03:58 <ajj> bleed builds sound epic 
06:04:08 <ajj> *batman voice* margit...do u bleed // margit: yes. extremely so 
06:04:27 <HellaBrad> almost everybody bleeds! except the shadow monsters
06:04:47 <HellaBrad> more ppl than youd expect really
06:05:01 <HellaBrad> lotta dead guys bleed
06:05:48 <HellaBrad> the tanks bleed because theres a lil guy in the back lol
06:05:53 <ajj> rofl
06:07:30 <eric> the tanks are so funny
06:11:14 <eric> cool knocked off the tree sentinal too
06:11:30 <eric> i feel like ive finally clicked with dodging and such
06:11:34 <eric> after 30 hrs
06:13:26 <ajj> hell yeah
06:13:35 <ajj> its v satisfying when u can pull it off
06:21:53 <eric> this game is so sick
06:28:06 <eric> im very overlevelled for this area
06:29:43 <ajj> u in stormviel castle?
06:30:04 <eric> yeah just got into the castle walls pretty much
06:30:11 <eric> after the cliff side with sword birds
06:37:35 <ajj> the sword birds are legit some of my least favorite enemies rofl
06:37:37 <ajj> they suck
06:37:52 <eric> anything flying sucks
06:38:01 <eric> except bosses
06:38:04 <eric> i hate bats
06:42:43 <ajj> yeah that one fort thats pitch black and theres a million bats ftl
06:44:33 <HellaBrad> the one up in dragon country? ugh yeah i spent forever clearing that fort. worth it for the item though
06:45:27 <ajj> ya that one
06:52:05 <HellaBrad> i spent like 40 mins going through it the first time and then the rat in the attic ate me
06:52:10 <HellaBrad> last enemy in the whole fort
06:52:17 <HellaBrad> lol
06:52:31 <ajj> lmao
06:52:51 <ajj> i explored it super early game so the bats would 1 shot me so i just spend forever trying to lure the bats out so i could bolt up the ladder
06:58:54 <HellaBrad> bold ploy dodging all those bats
06:59:41 <HellaBrad> the guys up top are a little easier to track but when the bats start swooping around i can never tell where theyre coming from next
06:59:55 <HellaBrad> i just had to gravity slam them one by one
07:04:29 <ajj> caelid makes u get really good at running past everything lol
07:04:49 <ajj> it was fun doing it super under level though just trying to run by and hoover up all drops and runes i could
07:06:30 <HellaBrad> ive gotten to the point where like 1/3rd the enemies in caelid i can kill without getting hit and the other 2/3rds i just avoid
07:07:09 <HellaBrad> i really love all the monsters there though, one of my fave areas so far by a big margin
07:08:03 <HellaBrad> love the beksinski aesthetic of the scarlet rot
07:08:33 <ajj> beksinski ftmfw
07:08:40 <ajj> yeah it's sick
07:09:23 <ajj> really gets off the inhospitable wasteland feeling when everything can kill you
07:09:53 <ajj> have you killed the putrid erdtree avatar yet? its a pain in the ass but you get 90k+ souls for it 
07:10:10 <HellaBrad> very cool area. only wish we had more weird mushroom stuff. mushroom city dlc please! all this strange fungus around and i cant interact with it at all
07:10:31 <HellaBrad> yeah hilariously that was the first erdtree avatar i killed
07:10:51 <ajj> rofl nice
07:10:58 <ajj> all the other ones youre like wow wtf these guys are pushovers
07:11:22 <HellaBrad> yeah haha ive done that with a bunch of bosses which has been really funny to discover
07:11:44 <HellaBrad> like i did the fight where you fight the godskin duo one at a time before i did either of them individually
07:12:14 <HellaBrad> up until i found the one erdtree guy that doubles himself i was laughing at them
07:12:34 <HellaBrad> that guy though... simply too many lasers

13:14:58 <NORG> i slept 10 hrs but still hella tired so im going back to bed lol

13:15:59 <Selfie_Dad> that sounds good as hel matt
13:16:12 <Selfie_Dad> i ate: egg 
13:16:15 <Nude_Riker> yum
13:16:17 <Selfie_Dad> and protein wafel
13:16:20 <Nude_Riker> i might add egg at home
13:16:26 <Nude_Riker> and some kraut
13:16:31 <Nude_Riker> or pickle
13:18:14 <Nude_Riker> lol the ucla career website's ssl cert expired yesterday
13:18:22 <wild_ape-style_creature> i beat a boss in elden ting now i'm going to train show
13:18:57 <Nude_Riker> neat, railfan time
13:20:34 <Nude_Riker> i took some thc8 last night and once again it has somehow only hit me 12 hours later
13:21:20 <Nude_Riker> *delta8
13:41:17 <scoop_jackson> and you vaped it? weird
13:48:21 <Nude_Riker> no, oil, its MCT oil and i held it under my tongue a long time before swallowing on an empty stomach so thats why its perplexing
13:48:47 <Nude_Riker> like, some lag time sure but why that long
13:48:50 <scoop_jackson> yeah
13:49:15 <Nude_Riker> it metabolizes differently than regular weed for me i guess, cause this has happened every time
13:49:24 <Nude_Riker> oh well, waste of $40
13:53:07 <mikev> is that delta8 stuff safe, it's sold at the smoke shops as weed alternative so i am skeptical
13:54:43 <Nude_Riker> i mean, its not regulated at all so i would say the vapes are not trustable
13:54:59 <Nude_Riker> edibles are pretty safe
13:55:49 <Nude_Riker> its not a weed alternative so much as a specific weed chemical that isnt banned, its in weed and hemp and is extracted not synthesized
14:06:02 <bonegar> why is a vape more trustable than an edible out of curiosity
14:06:58 <Nude_Riker> no i am saying the opposite
14:07:21 <bonegar> why is a edible more trustable than an vape out of curiosity
14:07:38 <Nude_Riker> for a few reasons but the most basic is your GI tract is just less susceptible to problems than your lungs
14:08:08 <Nude_Riker> like if it had fungal contaminants your stomach acid will just kill it whereas your lungs might get infected
14:08:13 <Selfie_Dad> what if he was
14:08:20 <Selfie_Dad> george double Ds bush
14:08:35 <scoop_jackson> lol nice name for this former german minister of denfese
14:08:35 <scoop_jackson> Karl-Theodor Maria Nikolaus Johann Jacob Philipp Franz Joseph Sylvester Buhl-Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg
14:09:01 <bonegar> buddy you're too many damn people, you're a whole family and a city
14:09:13 <Selfie_Dad> pick a name bitch
14:09:31 <bonegar> i asked your name not your damn life story
14:09:35 <Nude_Riker> the biscuit sandwich is good. i added egg at home
14:09:50 <bonegar> begetted ass bitch 
14:09:59 <Nude_Riker> lol
14:10:08 <bonegar> spicing up your sandwich with home eggs
14:14:09 <bonegar> been slicing up boiled eggs and eating them with tunafish, spring onion and diced pickles. demonic eating style.
14:17:41 <Nude_Riker> i got a can of the cento tuna in olive oil and it is good, not sure if it would be as good to just drain regular water packed tuna and put it in olive oil
14:19:31 <bonegar> dunno, i usually get the water packed kind, but supposedly the oil packed kind has 'more' omega 3s.. as if the oil binds together (true? who can say)
14:19:44 <bonegar> the oil kind usually tastes a bit better 
14:20:01 <bonegar> no need to add kewpie
14:22:32 <Nude_Riker> the whole seed oil conspiracy thing coming down to omega 3:6 ratios is pretty funny
14:24:17 <bonegar> what's the seed oil conspiracy?
14:25:44 <Nude_Riker> theres a bunch of people mostly right wing assholes who think "seed oils" (not an accurate category) are like causing a ton of health problems and are some globohomo conspiracy
14:26:02 <Nude_Riker> mostly its actually canola and soy oil they hate
14:26:22 <Nude_Riker> ties into the larger right wing anti soy thing
14:26:27 <Selfie_Dad> yeah
14:26:35 <Selfie_Dad> seed oils a ton of bull shit
14:26:57 <Nude_Riker> in my cursory research like yeah having too much omega 6 in comparison to 3 isnt good but these people are nuts
14:26:58 <bonegar> yea when you said seed oils i immediately thought 'flax?'
14:27:06 <Nude_Riker> i think they hate flax too
14:27:13 <Selfie_Dad> oil packed tuna tastes better but mostly because its sitting in oil for a while
14:27:15 <alansmithee_> wow got ourself a soyboy here
14:27:15 <bonegar> i've only ever used flax on wood lol
14:27:22 <alansmithee_> didn't know big oil got to you
14:27:28 <bonegar> <Selfie_Dad> oil packed tuna tastes better but mostly because its sitting in oil for a while
14:27:31 <bonegar> ^mfing THIS
14:27:34 <bonegar> doing the THIS dance
14:27:48 <Selfie_Dad> i dunno that sitting water packed tuna into oil replicates the experience
14:27:50 <Nude_Riker> my grandpa's french wife used to make this avocado vinaigrette with flax oil all the time
14:28:06 <Selfie_Dad> also probably the tuna they pack into oil is of higher quality t begin with
14:28:07 <Nude_Riker> yeah Selfie_Dad plus it would be a pain, if i want oil tuna i will buy oil tuna
14:28:13 <scoop_jackson> i only use american wti
14:29:32 <bonegar> grandpa's french wife...
14:30:07 <bonegar> not grandma... but grandpa's french wife... *thinking* all's fair in love and war i guess
14:30:24 <mikev> i think my illness is sinus infection
14:30:30 <mikev> annoying
14:30:34 <bonegar> uh oh
14:30:45 <mikev> gonna go back to the gym today though
14:30:47 <bonegar> people's sinuses are getting destroyed around the globe lately
14:30:49 <mikev> since it's been about a week now
14:31:27 <Selfie_Dad> its that time
14:31:32 <Selfie_Dad> pollen goin ham
14:34:22 <bonegar> going to a movie today... and so far i think im the only person in the theater
14:34:29 <bonegar> wondering if i can vape
14:35:13 <scoop_jackson> im going to play heroes 3 today
14:35:42 <mikev> you might as well
14:35:45 <mikev> to both of those
14:38:54 <registered_mirc> mikev: did you see i didnt get into smartbar lol
14:39:22 <mikev> :( yes
14:39:23 <bonegar> damn 3 more people booked
14:39:36 <mikev> that's lame
14:39:47 <mikev> one time the doorguy found a capsule in my pocket but put it back and let me in
14:39:49 <registered_mirc> i wasnt smart enough to get in
14:40:01 <bonegar> 1 more loner, and a couple... at least it doesn't look like a family
14:40:57 <registered_mirc> mikev: yeaah, i was like, its not cocaine but he said he saw it and i had to dispose of it so i took a short walk with pam and gave it to her and he was like dude i have to see you dispose of it
14:41:00 <registered_mirc> so that was that
14:41:38 <registered_mirc> its fine, rip

14:52:54 <wild_ape-style_creature> sadly there weren't many trains at the train show
14:53:11 <wild_ape-style_creature> it was being held at an outdoor flea market but we were supposed to get thunderstorms
14:53:16 <wild_ape-style_creature> the forecast changed abruptly this morning
14:53:31 <wild_ape-style_creature> a guy gave me this though

14:53:40 <wild_ape-style_creature> ancient train decals
14:53:58 <registered_mirc> score
14:54:31 <wild_ape-style_creature> mpg i beat the ancestral spirit this morning on my first try
14:54:39 <wild_ape-style_creature> lsat night i beat magma worm cale makar on my first try
14:54:43 <wild_ape-style_creature> i think i finally Got Good
14:56:16 <registered_mirc> hell yeah
14:56:24 <registered_mirc> those magma wyrm fights are pretty brutal
14:56:41 <registered_mirc> i like the ancestral spirit fights tho, felt more like classic souls
14:57:11 <wild_ape-style_creature> i got the draconic tree sentinel on my third lsat night too
14:57:17 <wild_ape-style_creature> it feels good to kill bosses on my own
14:57:43 <registered_mirc> what is your weapon?
14:57:59 <wild_ape-style_creature> switched to moonveil katana >: )
14:58:04 <wild_ape-style_creature> i was using uchigatana though
14:58:08 <registered_mirc> oh right duh
14:58:16 <registered_mirc> everyone loves the moonveil
14:58:18 <wild_ape-style_creature> think my moonveil katana is up to +4? uchigatana is +14
14:58:21 <registered_mirc> even post-nerf
14:58:42 <wild_ape-style_creature> actually i used the uchigatana on th edraconic tree sentinel i'm pretty sure
14:58:55 <wild_ape-style_creature> but i didn't use its special attack in any of the battles
14:58:59 <registered_mirc> ive seen a lot of ppl talking about dual weilding those
14:59:02 <wild_ape-style_creature> i keep forgetting
14:59:03 <registered_mirc> uchi + moonvail
14:59:06 <registered_mirc> veil
14:59:08 <wild_ape-style_creature> damn that would be sick
14:59:14 <wild_ape-style_creature> i use my shield a lot though
14:59:20 <wild_ape-style_creature> maybe i'll try dualies
14:59:45 <registered_mirc> i dual weilded great swords for a while but didn't find it to be too much more effective for me
14:59:56 <registered_mirc> kinda wish they had more unique animations based on what you were holding
15:00:15 <wild_ape-style_creature> have you beaten it yet
15:00:24 <registered_mirc> no but im inching closer
15:00:33 <registered_mirc> im really taking my time lol
15:00:41 <wild_ape-style_creature> i don't think i will actually beat it
15:00:43 <wild_ape-style_creature> but that's fine
15:01:20 <registered_mirc> then only souls-like that has bested me so far is sekiro
15:01:38 <registered_mirc> but its mostly because it requires stuff that i dont really want to do
15:01:42 <registered_mirc> cool ass game tho
15:02:12 <alansmithee_> registered_mirc: i've used moonveil and uchi
15:02:30 <alansmithee_> i was using the meteorite katana for a bit but wanted to drop my str so went back to uchi
15:02:53 <registered_mirc> how was it dual weilding those
15:02:59 <alansmithee_> they do have special animation for dual katanas
15:03:05 <alansmithee_> it's mostly fine
15:03:05 <registered_mirc> oh sweet
15:03:28 <alansmithee_> like i guess a lot of weapon categories actually have unique animations/movesets i guess
15:03:38 <alansmithee_> if you use the l1 attack
15:04:01 <registered_mirc> dual colossal swords seemed to only have one thing where you bring both swords down at once
15:04:05 <alansmithee_> problem i have is you rarely seem to even get the chance to go through your attack animations
15:04:25 <alansmithee_> cause even when you get behind a boss they're always moving and shit
15:05:41 <alansmithee_> every boss i seem to have left for the most part just seems like bigger and bigger bullshit tho
15:07:13 <registered_mirc> im at haligtree now and its nerve wracking
15:07:21 <Nude_Riker> learning that the next tenants will have in-unit washer/dryer and a new bathroom, would have been nice to have!
15:07:40 <registered_mirc> that sucks
15:07:44 <registered_mirc> feels bad
15:07:46 <registered_mirc> bad feelings
15:07:48 <Nude_Riker> i should look up what rent he's advertising at
15:08:40 <Nude_Riker> 1550+ 42 per tenant in water, so over 200 more than currently
15:09:25 <Nude_Riker> $120~ over the renewal i was offered, but that wouldnt have had w/d or new bathroom
15:18:20 <HellaBrad> Still a criminal rate
15:18:41 <Nude_Riker> yeah, housing markets fucked
15:20:54 <wild_ape-style_creature> i can't live somewhere without w/d in unit
15:21:01 <wild_ape-style_creature> i am too insane about how i do my laundry ot use a laundromat
15:21:20 <bonegar> ive done both and having an in-unit is godlike
15:22:00 <wild_ape-style_creature> we have them in the kitchen
15:22:27 <Nude_Riker> i would love to have them! but finding that in my price range here has been very hard to impossible
15:22:44 <bonegar> having to make an extra trip to do laundry sucks, having to pay a useless amount of coins to use a machine sucks even more
15:23:00 <bonegar> coin operated should be illegal
15:23:29 <bonegar> the choe of being responsible for like 12 dollars worth of quarters a month
15:23:33 <bonegar> chore
15:23:33 <Nude_Riker> yeah i need to do a bunch of laundry today and i think ill just go to a laundromat for the first time in a year instead of feeding the shitty machine in the basement quarters
15:23:46 <wild_ape-style_creature> this apartment is probably the best i'll ever live in
15:23:56 <wild_ape-style_creature> our rent just hit 4 figgies in jan
15:23:58 <wild_ape-style_creature> we pay 1k
15:24:01 <wild_ape-style_creature> so 500 each
15:24:04 <Nude_Riker> damn
15:24:11 <wild_ape-style_creature> when we started living here it was uhh... 850? 900? 8 years ago
15:24:18 <bonegar> if my landlord ups my rent i'll probably just burn down his actual home
15:24:28 <registered_mirc> i currently pay $1k for a 2br as well
15:24:30 <wild_ape-style_creature> lmao yeah whenever he does it he's like "my wife is making me"
15:24:36 <bonegar> lmao
15:24:36 <registered_mirc> lmao
15:24:37 <bonegar> a wife guy
15:24:38 <registered_mirc> hahaha
15:24:41 <bonegar> men love to say that
15:24:49 <wild_ape-style_creature> this year he raised it because water bill and insurance doubled
15:24:53 <registered_mirc> you cant refute it is why
15:25:02 <bonegar> sure ya can
15:25:03 <wild_ape-style_creature> i think the water bill doubled becuase the freaks downstairs were running the water constant;y
15:25:09 <registered_mirc> what are you gonna say, no she isn't?
15:25:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> really looking forward to taking showers that don't get cold agian
15:25:14 <wild_ape-style_creature> again
15:25:16 <wild_ape-style_creature> well like
15:25:21 <wild_ape-style_creature> he was only raising hte rent 25 dollars a month
15:25:23 <wild_ape-style_creature> every few years
15:25:24 <bonegar> gonna say 'oh so you throw your wife under the bus at every opportunity?'
15:25:27 <wild_ape-style_creature> it's not really anytihng to complain about 
15:25:34 <bonegar> very brave man you are
15:25:37 <registered_mirc> im sure that will be very effective
15:25:38 <wild_ape-style_creature> lmao
15:25:51 <bonegar> as effective as the excuse
15:26:01 <Nude_Riker> i watched a forgotten weapons in the last showing, this time i will listen to breakcore
15:26:03 <bonegar> it's just a bald-faced lie, or he's a cuck
15:26:25 <bonegar> huge pet-peeve of mine, married guys love to do it and i will absolutely roast them
15:26:54 <Nude_Riker> its a classic trait of toxic patriarchal cishet relations to say you hate your partner
15:26:57 <bonegar> obviously the price isn't going to chage beyond 'no i wont pay that you can evict me good luck finding a new tennant'
15:27:07 <bonegar> they love to do it
15:27:08 <bonegar> they really do
15:27:35 <bonegar> free excuse that only holds water with certain types of people.. but to other people it's a huge joke and they should be mocked for it
15:27:44 <bonegar> pick your audience if you're gonna wife-guy it up
15:27:53 <Nude_Riker> sammo puked right before the first showing lol
15:28:00 <Nude_Riker> i cleaned it up but i hope they smelled it
15:28:41 <Nude_Riker> which is less likely because i had them wear masks
15:30:33 <bonegar> i havent had to deal with showings since college
15:30:54 <Nude_Riker> lucky
15:31:04 <bonegar> do you have more than a 30 day notice or something?
15:31:12 <Nude_Riker> 3 month in this place lol
15:31:15 <bonegar> i thought you werent moving back until summer for some reason
15:31:19 <bonegar> lol... by law?
15:31:24 <bonegar> i would just.. not do that
15:31:28 <Nude_Riker> by the lease, so yes
15:31:37 <bonegar> or what? they hold your deposit?
15:31:39 <Nude_Riker> autorenewal clause
15:31:51 <bonegar> wow some real scumbag setup there lol
15:31:59 <bonegar> i guess i'd live in filth for 3 months
15:32:00 <Nude_Riker> the last place had the same thing but 2 month
15:32:07 <bonegar> never heard of this lmao
15:32:18 <bonegar> i guess that's why i avoid rental agencies
15:32:26 <Nude_Riker> this isnt an agency its one guy
15:32:47 <bonegar> crazy to me, lol
15:32:56 <bonegar> guess the east coast is fucked
15:33:14 <eric> Wives aren't always perfect. Karen's, for example, are often wives 
15:33:26 <bonegar> muh.. muh karen made me bloo
15:33:30 <Nude_Riker> that was also the case when i rented in college in eugene oregon due to everything there being collegetown slumlords
15:33:48 <Nude_Riker> in fact the only rental ive ever had with a reasonable lease and rent control was in los angeles
15:33:52 <bonegar> yea college they know you're there for like a year tops
15:34:09 <Nude_Riker> went to month to month after initial term and fixed like 2.5% yearly increase by law
15:34:52 <bonegar> my SF rent was rent-controlled but the guy absolutely wife'd up and she had all these little schemes to charge extra money for things and she'd constantly do the math wrong every year when increasing the rent by the legal limit
15:35:25 <wild_ape-style_creature> well the thing about my landlord is taht he and his wife own the properties together and she handles finances
15:35:31 <wild_ape-style_creature> so it's not him doing landlord wife schemes
15:35:34 <bonegar> the place i'm at now is like month-to-month but i dont really expect to get my deposit back and the guy is nice. 
15:35:39 <wild_ape-style_creature> it's just that his wife determines the rent
15:35:55 <bonegar> just
15:36:04 <bonegar> seems like determining the rent is a big part of renting
15:36:29 <bonegar> they love to make their wife do the finances.. actually thinking about this, my dad makes my mom do the finances too
15:36:38 <Nude_Riker> downloading tremors the tv show wild_ape-style_creature 
15:36:51 <wild_ape-style_creature> oh hell yes
15:37:25 <Nude_Riker> apparently the plot picks up after tremors 3
15:37:39 <wild_ape-style_creature> guess we have to watch the other two before watching the series
15:37:56 <Nude_Riker> guess so
15:37:59 <wild_ape-style_creature> for those of us who haven't seen the movies a billion times (dreddybajs)
15:38:09 <wild_ape-style_creature> i love tremors and will watch these movies any time
15:38:33 <bonegar> i didnt realize tremors was so beloved
15:40:09 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm eating potato for breakfast and peter is trying to hard to share my food

16:07:24 <mikev> CC:DISCO put out an all dub mix nic
16:07:28 <mikev> Very rare
16:07:51 <mikev> I still gotta disagree with people who think dubs are superior for the club
16:07:57 <mikev> Or most of the time at least
16:10:26 <scoop_jackson> cool
16:10:45 <scoop_jackson> yeah no reason for dub mixes to be intrinsically superior
16:10:55 <mikev> Her argument is that it’s easier to mix
16:10:57 <mikev> Which is true
16:11:04 <mikev> But I wish I heard more vocals
16:11:17 <scoop_jackson> i dont think thats true
16:11:32 <mikev> I mean vocals make it intrinsically harder imo

16:11:53 <scoop_jackson> ok but then you just look the intro before there are any vocals
16:11:58 <scoop_jackson> *loop
16:12:34 <mikev> Yeah but it’s still constraining. And having to wait for breaks half way thru if you’re mixing out
16:12:40 <mikev> But hell I love all mixes
16:13:12 <mikev> I should do a set again sometime it’s been forever

16:32:28 <wild_ape-style_creature> ^

16:32:50 <Nude_Riker> i hope the person im buying this perfume from just hasnt sent it yet and it didnt get lost
16:33:01 <Nude_Riker> nothing in my informed delivery...
16:33:21 <mpg> Perfumer Matt
16:33:54 <Nude_Riker> its the perfume ive wanted for a couple years and bought a dupe of that isnt quite right, but $40 cheaper because used even though she barely used any of it
16:34:09 <bonegar> holy shit
16:34:13 <bonegar> i just noticed something in my menu
16:35:00 <wild_ape-style_creature> do you use a perfume for women on yourself or do you use it to make your house smell nice
16:35:08 <bonegar> https://i.imgur.com/qZkUn2l.jpg
16:35:12 <wild_ape-style_creature> i don't know anytihng about perfumes
16:35:13 <bonegar> i do not know what happens when i do this
16:35:21 <HellaBrad> What perfume matt
16:35:24 <wild_ape-style_creature> damn you got a little homie with you
16:35:25 <wild_ape-style_creature> talk to her
16:35:29 <Nude_Riker> i think the idea of perfumes being gendered is kind of silly/outdated tbh
16:35:34 <Nude_Riker> but yeah on me
16:35:42 <Nude_Riker> le labo santal 33 HellaBrad 
16:36:44 <Nude_Riker> apologies if that sounded like i meant you were being silly wild_ape-style_creature i mean in general
16:37:01 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm looking at it now and it's unisex
16:37:16 <Nude_Riker> i have a few friends really into Fragrance and basically everything is unisex now
16:37:21 <wild_ape-style_creature> Perfume Oil which i guess is different from the old woman perfume i was imagining
16:37:27 <bonegar> continuing to observe until everything becomes unisex
16:37:31 <wild_ape-style_creature> this crap is 158 dollars new
16:37:42 <Nude_Riker> depends on the size and form wild_ape-style_creature

16:37:55 <wild_ape-style_creature> it doesn't tell me what it smells like
16:38:17 <HellaBrad> cardamom, iris, violet, ambrox which crackle in the formula and bring to this smoking wood alloy (Australian sandalwood, cedarwood) some spicy, leathery, musky notes
16:38:23 <HellaBrad> Sounds good
16:38:29 <Nude_Riker> this is the eau de parfum spray, half ounce, $88 new
16:38:31 <wild_ape-style_creature> Do you remember the old Marlboro ads? A man and his horse in front of the fire on a great plain under tall, blue evening skies.
16:38:31 <wild_ape-style_creature> A defining image of the spirit of the American West with all it implied about masculinity and personal freedom.  This man, firelight in his face, leaning on the worn leather saddle, alone with the desert wind, an icon so powerful that every man wanted to be him and every woman wanted to have him... From this memory is born SANTAL 33: the ambition to create an olfactive form inspired by the great American 
16:38:31 <wild_ape-style_creature> myth still a source of fantasy for the rest of the world... A perfume that touches the sensual universality of this icon... that would intoxicate a man as much as a woman... that introduces our use of cardamom, iris, violet, ambrox which crackle in the formula and bring to this smoking wood alloy (Australian sandalwood, cedarwood) some spicy, leathery, musky notes, and gives this perfume its unisex signature 
16:38:32 <HellaBrad> What's ambrox
16:38:33 <wild_ape-style_creature> and addictive comfort.  Here is, in a few words, what SANTAL 33 is... An open fire…The soft drift of smoke…Where sensuality rises after the light has gone.
16:40:14 <Nude_Riker> the dupe i got was maison louis marie no 4, but in the oil not spray, its a little too sweet but part of that might be the almond carrier oil
16:40:21 <HellaBrad> Oh ambrox is just a cooler way of saying ambergris lol
16:40:35 <HellaBrad> Since I guess too many people know what ambergris is by now
16:40:50 <Nude_Riker> i think its because they use a synthetic now?
16:40:55 <wild_ape-style_creature> i don't know what it is
16:41:02 <bonegar> famous whale puke
16:41:06 <Nude_Riker> ambergris is from whales, not very PC
16:41:11 <HellaBrad> It's a kind of waxy material that builds up in whale stomachs
16:41:20 <Nude_Riker> like musk in perfumes isnt actual animal musk anymore either
16:42:14 <HellaBrad> Yeah ambergris / ambrox is what gives perfumes their staying power
16:43:13 <HellaBrad> That's why it was a precious substance back in the days of whale-slaying (I guess 30 years ago)

17:25:53 <mikev> this one doesn't list hte views on the page
17:33:06 <dreddybajs> yeah it's really annoying
17:33:31 <Nude_Riker> mikev, some of that is just page scaling
17:33:32 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i hate that shit
17:33:54 <Nude_Riker> i went thrhough this with someone recently and they just had the page small so elements werent showing
17:35:09 <Nude_Riker> dislikes are the only thing thats actually gone now afaik https://i.imgur.com/hFKzg9b.png
17:37:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> spub
17:38:05 <mikev> i went into theater mode and it didn't show it either
17:38:28 <mikev> not something i care enough about to try and fix i guess
17:38:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> dreddybajs: another mtg question but im like 99% i already know the answer to this
17:39:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> if you have underrealm lich out, since the ability isn't a 'may,' you can't dredge unless you play a spell or ability that makes you draw cards right https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/GKbRXCcE/image.png
17:40:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> this would be good in my grist deck if not for the fact that it turns off dredging which is pretty important
17:41:14 <dreddybajs> I'm actually not sure, if both replacement effects were "may", you would choose which to apply if any
17:41:30 <dreddybajs> since that one is mandatory i think it takes precedence? not confident on this one
17:41:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> dredge is a may and this is an instead
17:41:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> so i think you just cant dredge on your draw step
17:42:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> actually i guess since it's an instead, you can't dredge off any supplemental drawing (ie phyrexian arena) either
17:42:42 <dreddybajs> why only draw step
17:42:48 <dreddybajs> neither reference that
17:42:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah idk i was thinking of it as just replacing the draw on your draw step but i guess it replaces all drawing
17:43:10 <dreddybajs> ya
17:43:23 <dreddybajs> which i think means you can never dredge because you can never draw
17:43:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> i guess if it were a may that would be sort of busted with dredge
17:43:28 <dreddybajs> but I'm not sure
17:43:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> but then again it also costs 5 mana so, maybe not exactly busted
17:44:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh man i got an all time great spam email today
17:44:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/HJny8daa/Screen%20Shot%202022-03-19%20at%201.41.15%20PM.png
17:44:24 <dreddybajs> generally when you have two replacement effects, the owner chooses which one to apply
17:44:34 <mikev> time for pillars
17:44:36 <dreddybajs> but because one is may and one is mandatory here, I'm not sure
17:44:55 -!- Homie_in_a_geod changed the topic of #phiz to: elden ring group/mp pw: eldphiz || Feminist*HATE_this PenisTrick

18:01:02 <eric> weir replicant
18:01:40 <eric> ManPlus
18:03:50 <wild_ape-style_creature> about to fight a malformed star
18:03:53 <wild_ape-style_creature> these things look scary
18:04:41 <HellaBrad> sounds tough!
18:04:47 <eric> i dont like bug like foes
18:04:56 <eric> those guys with all the little hands are so annoying
18:05:01 <eric> who shoot the weird threads
18:05:20 <HellaBrad> the "kindred of rot" lol
18:05:23 <HellaBrad> i just found their ashes
18:05:32 <HellaBrad> they suck to fight for sure
18:05:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> pleep
18:05:48 <NORG> mikev fuck this ncaa rigjob
18:05:54 <wild_ape-style_creature> well i died because there are a billion weird rolling enemies in here 
18:06:03 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm trying to run past but i got stuck locking onto like 4 dfifferent things
18:06:08 <wild_ape-style_creature> and an item message also wouldn't go away
18:06:36 <HellaBrad> where are you? i dont think i fought this boss
18:06:45 <wild_ape-style_creature> i don't think it's a boss
18:06:49 <wild_ape-style_creature> it's just a big enemy
18:06:59 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm at the uhl palace ruins
18:07:10 <wild_ape-style_creature> ainsel river
18:07:12 <wild_ape-style_creature> where all the ants are
18:07:22 <HellaBrad> ah yeah i dont think i finished exploring there
18:07:34 <HellaBrad> the underground is such a weird place
18:07:45 <HellaBrad> i liked the big ants 
18:08:11 <wild_ape-style_creature> they're mean
18:08:33 <HellaBrad> you just need to learn how to properly communicate with them
18:08:50 <HellaBrad> coexist with the bug friends
18:09:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> i watched 2 movies last night
18:09:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> and about half of a third
18:09:59 <HellaBrad> what'd you watch?
18:10:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> adaptation, which was extremely good
18:10:11 <eric> love that movie
18:10:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> the lpc documentary, which was a mess but it was lpc so it was funny
18:10:18 <HellaBrad> really great nice cage performance
18:10:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> nice cage
18:10:33 <HellaBrad> lol
18:10:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i watched half of raiders of the lost ark which i had never seen
18:10:42 <eric> australian voice neck cage
18:10:46 <bonegar> what did you think of half of raiders?
18:10:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> its fun
18:10:57 <eric> those are good movie
18:11:10 <eric> i dont remember raiders that much though as ive seen it the least often
18:11:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> raiders makes me miss when action movies werent afraid to be silly
18:11:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> and not in the stupid mcu fanservice way of being silly
18:11:25 <HellaBrad> raiders is one of those movies im always down to watch
18:11:46 <HellaBrad> yeah its just a great fun adventure film
18:11:54 <wild_ape-style_creature> i likked it
18:11:56 <wild_ape-style_creature> killed*
18:11:58 <bonegar> they should let me text in the theater when i go see the movie so i can liveblog it
18:12:00 <eric> well done
18:12:04 <HellaBrad> good work
18:12:20 <bonegar> that's the area i'm at now shrimp
18:12:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> i really loved adaptation though, a lot more than i thought i would
18:12:38 <wild_ape-style_creature> you get like 3.8k runes
18:12:43 <wild_ape-style_creature> nice bonegar
18:12:51 <bonegar> is that that harlie kaufman movie
18:12:55 <eric> yeah
18:13:01 <bonegar> i remember laughing really hard at the swamp part
18:13:03 <bonegar> good part
18:13:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
18:14:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> i really liked how it does the whole metanarrative thing in a way that is like, not completely up its own ass
18:15:00 <NORG> are you going to see The Batman bonegar
18:15:08 <eric> yeah its fun and funny and not pretentious really
18:15:08 <bonegar> yah
18:15:31 <bonegar> mostly going to go more than the batmanness of it
18:15:48 <bonegar> havent been to a theater since 2019
18:16:12 <bonegar> nd they opened up the one i can walk or bike to.. can't find my key for my bikelock though so i'll probably want
18:16:15 <bonegar> walk
18:17:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> eric: yeah it really nips the potential pretentiousness in the bud as part of its own conceit
18:17:17 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm a dumbass and lost a bunch of runes by falling down an elebvator shaft
18:17:28 <wild_ape-style_creature> right after slipping and falling off a ledge
18:17:36 <HellaBrad> we've all been there :S
18:17:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> i should watch synechdoche new york at some point
18:17:52 <HellaBrad> i dont think ive seen a movie in theatres since the rise of skywalker lol
18:17:54 <bonegar> you should have found ranni's snow witch set if you're there shrimp
18:18:03 <eric> iu ahvent seen that either
18:18:15 <eric> ive only seen adaptation and being john malkovich
18:18:19 <bonegar> yea rise of skywalker was like.. right before the pandemic
18:18:22 <eric> and like 1/3 of anomalisa
18:18:27 <HellaBrad> synecdoche is very good
18:18:36 <bonegar> i ended up not seeing it because so many people were seeing it so everyone had plans and i didn't care too much
18:18:39 <mikev> lol norg i didn't even watch the tourny so far
18:18:48 <NORG> i havent seen synech thingy but i want to
18:18:54 <NORG> ive seen the rest. except anomailosia
18:19:04 <NORG> mikev this game on right now is legitimately pathetic
18:19:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dint like being john malkovich when i first saw it but that was a long time ago
18:19:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> i expect id like it more now
18:19:22 <eric> i liked it but i dont remember much
18:19:29 <eric> its pretty funny
18:19:42 <eric> i like that part in adaptation where they visit the set
18:19:43 <NORG> i liked his new one a whole lot
18:19:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
18:19:51 <bonegar> i tried watching synecdoche newyork but it was too depressing and i didn't get through the first 30 mins
18:19:59 <NORG> w fat jesse plemons and that irish girl being american
18:20:15 <bonegar> .gis jesse plemons
18:20:21 <bonegar> lol
18:20:22 <bonegar> that guy
18:20:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> its kind of wild that all of the real people in adaptation allowed the movie to be made
18:20:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
18:20:31 <wild_ape-style_creature> it's the friday night lights guy
18:20:39 <HellaBrad> synecdoche is probably one of his bleakest films but there's a lot of great stuff in it
18:20:48 <HellaBrad> the house that's permanently on fire is a great bit
18:20:48 <bonegar> that guy always looks like someone tried to clone matt damon and came up a little short
18:20:52 <wild_ape-style_creature> rofl
18:20:52 <wild_ape-style_creature> he does
18:21:21 <bonegar> yea i was not in the right headspace to be watching it
18:21:58 <bonegar> i think im gonna walk instead of bike so i can smok w33d while i walk there
18:22:22 <eric> smoke wheat
18:22:35 <bonegar> then i will have the craft beers
18:23:49 <wild_ape-style_creature> my shoulders hurt from bike ride yesterday
18:23:50 <wild_ape-style_creature> but not my legs
18:23:59 <bonegar> what kinda handlebars do you have?
18:24:09 <bonegar> also how is your seat aligned
18:24:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> drop bars
18:24:41 <wild_ape-style_creature> but i use the top bar, not the bottom
18:24:48 <bonegar> da best kind
18:24:50 <wild_ape-style_creature> i just tense up when i ride
18:24:55 <bonegar> i have a t-bar and i hate it and wish it was drop bars
18:24:57 <wild_ape-style_creature> the path wa swashed out and very bumpy
18:25:04 <wild_ape-style_creature> not good for road bike
18:25:35 <bonegar> found my key but def opting out of biking i think, even though they built a new bike lane just for me
18:26:48 <bonegar> this might be my first post pandemic normal person thing that isn't wandering around alone in the woods
18:26:58 <bonegar> by myself
18:27:12 <HellaBrad> sounds like a nice afternoon, taking a leisurely stroll to see the bat
18:27:18 <wild_ape-style_creature> have fun
18:27:55 <bonegar> 70% of me wants to stay home and play more elden ring lol
18:28:12 <NORG> i never watched firday night lights so jesse plemons is always the kid shooter in breaking bad to me. except he got very fat
18:28:24 <wild_ape-style_creature> maybe instead of seeing a 3 hour movie you could walk and smoke and then come back and game
18:28:27 <wild_ape-style_creature> a nice compromise
18:28:32 <wild_ape-style_creature> friday night lights is epic
18:28:42 <bonegar> nah, getting out the door is the hurdle not the movie
18:28:50 <wild_ape-style_creature> hte guy who played tim riggins went on to play david koresh in the dramatization of hte waco disaster
18:29:15 <HellaBrad> which teen drama has the higher highs and lower lows of high school football, fnl or riverdale

18:42:45 <HellaBrad> i think with this disaster it was like a big kiln that grilled everybody which, i cant decide if thats worse or not
18:43:02 <HellaBrad> enjoy the movie!
18:43:20 <eric> Had the bodies broken through the furnace, they would have instantly been vaporized by the molten glass.
18:43:26 <wild_ape-style_creature> Every year since 1892, the University of California and the Stanford University football teams play an annual game towards the end of November or the beginning of December.[3] The event is known as The Big Game.
18:43:38 <eric> wow
18:43:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> 2:41 PM <eric> falling into molten metal would suck
18:43:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> according to this if the furnace had been broken open everyone would have been instantly vaporized
18:44:18 <eric> each sentence is more brutal than the last
18:44:28 <wild_ape-style_creature> Despite the incident, the game continued with Stanford winning.
18:44:34 <HellaBrad> yeah this is insanely gruesome
18:44:50 <wild_ape-style_creature> i think i'd rather be vaporized than fry on a 500 degree surface while being sprayed with hot oil
18:45:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> i agree i think
18:45:16 <HellaBrad> imagine being in a disaster like this and being so grateful you're one of the people who just fell a hundred feet down onto a factory floor
18:45:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> hope not to have to make that  choice at any point
18:45:56 <eric> yeah getting impaled on a spike so your dont slide off the 500 degree furnace would be pretty bad
18:46:33 <wild_ape-style_creature> i wouldn't want to fall 100 feet either
18:46:39 <wild_ape-style_creature> just vaporize me
18:46:41 <wild_ape-style_creature> ez death
18:46:57 <wild_ape-style_creature> instead of insane torture and/or paralysis
18:47:12 <wild_ape-style_creature> this feels like a saw choice
18:51:56 <eric> .g movie where guy falls into printing pres
18:52:00 <wild_ape-style_creature> lmao i got the mimic veil
18:52:02 <wild_ape-style_creature> this thing is sick
18:52:16 <dreddybajs> it rocks
18:52:36 <dreddybajs> I was following a guy i invaded around as a bush

19:03:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> jesus christ
19:04:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> here’s a tweet an irl friend retweeted sincerely https://twitter.com/michaelfulwiler/status/1504928543880454153?s=21
19:04:28 <bonephone> i’m in 
19:04:43 <eric> into the breach
19:05:05 <het> Homie_in_a_geod: I don't wholly disagree with that
19:05:39 <NORG> schitts creek
19:05:39 <HellaBrad> there are def white people ive seen online who have almost exclusively black reaction gif librarys and it *is* weird
19:05:46 <het> yeah that's really what I mean
19:06:13 <het> like reaction gifs and also like weirdly adopting AAVE slang in a way that feels very affected
19:06:59 <eric> reaction gifs are stupid anyway
19:07:06 <het> agreed
19:07:11 <bonephone> people naturally gravitate to real culture 
19:07:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> it’s really more the schitts creek part of it but also like… some of these gifs are exceptionally well known memes and it seems very weird to retcon them being racially exclusive
19:07:51 <bonephone> the air is kinda fetid in here 
19:07:53 <het> sure, I'm not saying it applies to literally any reaction gif with a black person and I also agree that while schitts creek is fine people are weird about that too
19:08:02 <bonephone> i’m too used to being outside when i go out 
19:08:05 <eric> the scent of aircon
19:08:13 <bonephone> i wish 
19:08:20 <bonephone> kinda fetid tbqh
19:08:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> like yeah there are definitely people who do weird things but also i don’t need some white dude who is mostly doing this to scold himself (see replies) to tell me i’m doing blackface if i use that one wee-bey gif
19:09:03 <het> if you know who young leek be then you're allowed to use the weebey gif
19:09:03 <HellaBrad> *new elden ring area noise* ~Fetid Theatre~
19:09:04 <het> otherwise no
19:09:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
19:09:13 <eric> lol
19:09:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> digital baltimoreface
19:10:01 <het> I just thought of the pun hamsterdammerung and now I need to find a situation in which to use it
19:10:04 <wild_ape-style_creature> digital blackface
19:12:00 <eric> the problem with the tweet is that it presents things as (heh) black and white and eschews all nuance
19:12:33 <eric> which is how people talk to each other online
19:12:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> one might say that the format of twitter necessitates the eschewal of nuance
19:14:08 <bonephone> thinking about leaving the theater and going for a hike 
19:14:20 <eric> stay strong
19:14:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> the batman
19:14:44 <bonephone> this place is staffed by hundreds of children 
19:17:02 <eric> i think it wouild be way creepier for someone to concienciously only post gifs of white people than to post a variety of races
19:17:19 <eric> im sure lots of people do that without thinking 
19:17:55 <eric> but it seems weird to be like limiting your online vocabulary to only things created by your race
19:18:40 <bonephone> yeah
19:19:48 <bonephone> maybe all faces should be banned 
19:20:19 <HellaBrad> a guy who explicitly records his own reaction gifs
19:21:20 <eric> yeah and i think to get to the root of the problem its like i get the politics of cultural appropriation and thats important to think about sometimes
19:21:29 <bonephone> i find those ‘generic person doing the ‘this’ reaction gifs very haunting 
19:23:53 <eric> but like what are the real politics of somebody making a funny face in a tv show and then people relating to that personally or whatever
19:23:53 <HellaBrad> yeah there's a whole extra uncanny layer to seeing a meme degraded through actual human replication
19:25:35 <eric> one of the examples of tat guy posting reacion gifs is one of obama which is really funny to me
19:25:44 <eric> because thats just about one of the whitest black guys i can imagine
19:26:24 <eric> maybe im going to far with that
19:28:45 <HellaBrad> i mean its like anything regarding racial politics if you're fair and equitable in your approach i dont think anyone could argue with you morally, hes just asking people to examine how they view black performance and expression as a flattened emotional signifier in language, and whether their proportionate use of that reflects an othering that contributes to racial hegemony
19:29:21 <HellaBrad> buts its tremendously abstract bullshit to try and communicate on twitter which is why it provokes such hilariously bad discussions
19:30:28 <eric> i think you are right
19:31:10 <HellaBrad> its a dumb conversation to have anywhere other than face to face tbh and hes clearly talking about somebody he knows with this tweet so i think he should just talk to that person
19:31:14 <HellaBrad> its a very narrow problem to have
19:33:00 <HellaBrad> but it definitely does exist, ive known some guys who do a lot of "woke" shit and use a lot of reaction gifs of exclusively black women overemoting in like reality tv and the vibe from them is truly unsettling
19:34:21 <HellaBrad> anyways i am truly sick of the godskin bosses i hope i never have to fight another one of these things
19:35:08 <eric> twitter is one of the worst places to  go talk shit because i think the way people engage with it is like every tweet is part of some great conversation about the issues
19:36:06 <scoop_jackson> twitter and fossils fuels are the engine of the world
19:39:18 <eric> this has me thinking a bit about the way people identify so much by the content they consume now
19:39:31 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah
19:40:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> .gis egged egg
19:40:51 <eric> w ha?
19:40:58 <eric> The tomb was empty and so is one egg
19:41:12 <wild_ape-style_creature> this bird rune farm is insane
19:41:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
19:45:28 <HellaBrad> the bird rune area rocks
19:45:57 <HellaBrad> i would say the moghwyn palace is prob my second favorite zone so far
19:46:33 <HellaBrad> just reached farum azula today and its also very cool, remidns me of bayonetta
19:47:06 <wild_ape-style_creature> this feels like cheating
19:47:56 <HellaBrad> hacking up those lil grey guys doesnt feel so bad but the bird definitely feels like a huge amount of runes for no work
19:49:40 <wild_ape-style_creature> it's cool that this dumbass bird can't fly
19:53:55 <HellaBrad> mock the flightless bird all you want but at the end of the day he sleeps easy knowing all his runes were ruthlessly pecked from the tarnished
19:54:40 <HellaBrad> :P
19:58:02 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm level 80 now
19:58:06 <wild_ape-style_creature> guess i'll battle radahn
20:03:18 <HellaBrad> it's a very cool boss fight, have fun! i love his model design
20:03:45 <HellaBrad> probably the hardest i have laughed in a fromsoft game

22:43:18 <dreddybajs> clever technique...
22:44:59 <eric> da pedagoger 
22:52:47 <dreddybajs> hows your elden quest going eric
22:53:09 <eric> i havent played today unfort
22:53:20 <dreddybajs> unfort... night...
22:53:34 <eric> but last night i beat the first dragon boss near the starting area and then the tree guy on the horse by the start
22:53:37 <eric> and then margit
22:53:41 <dreddybajs> hell yeah
22:53:52 <dreddybajs> danielle was streaming there and she kicked a bunch of boss ass
22:54:12 <eric> nice well done danielle
22:54:19 <wild_ape-style_creature> ty
22:54:45 <wild_ape-style_creature> i Got Good apparently
22:54:54 <wild_ape-style_creature> i followed everyone's advice to simply get good and i did
22:54:57 <eric> last i stopped i was in the walls of stormveil (?) fighting some creeps
22:54:59 <NORG> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/203227948986138624/954870279643996210/unknown.png :(
22:55:01 <NORG> poor yuna
22:55:06 <eric> and im very overlevelled
22:55:16 <wild_ape-style_creature> i killed three dragons and a couple other bosses and radahn
22:55:19 <dreddybajs> stormveil is kind of a pain in the ass imo
22:55:23 <dreddybajs> i found it very confusing to navigate
22:55:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> stormveil made me want to stop playing
22:55:33 <eric> i felt like yesterday i was really clicking on the dodge timing
22:55:57 <eric> and i was much more in control of like not attacking too much
22:56:04 <eric> so i think i may also be starting to get good
22:56:04 <dreddybajs> nice
22:56:06 <dreddybajs> patience ftw
22:58:23 <wild_ape-style_creature> good luck on your get good journey eric
22:58:28 <wild_ape-style_creature> i still don't feel like i am good but i guess i might be
22:58:41 <wild_ape-style_creature> because it feels like it happened very suddenly
22:59:14 <dreddybajs> yeah this type of game definitely hits you with some eureka moments
22:59:19 <dreddybajs> where something just clicks and youre better 
23:02:16 <eric> yeah im not sure what it is exactly i guess im still flailing around a lot but i feel more intentional about it
23:02:32 <NORG> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/203227948986138624/954877393452019773/FOPpeoXXIAcwdq9.png
23:02:48 <eric> like some of the mechanics have internalised so now theres more room in my attention to do other stuff like stop attacking or pay attention to what move the guy is doing
23:03:01 <eric> or like backstep instead of roll or just run away
23:03:39 <dreddybajs> yeah, in fighting games they call it "the mental stack" lol
23:03:40 <eric> american women
23:03:50 <dreddybajs> you defeat your opponent by overwhelming them with too many options to keep track of
23:05:58 <bonegar> big news everyone im back 
23:06:05 <eric> how was the film
23:06:36 <bonegar> pretty good felt like a big tv show i think because of all the close ups and kinda weird edits
