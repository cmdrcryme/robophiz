01:47:20 <dreddybajs> they should simply put the puck in the goal imo
01:47:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> meanwhile coyotes are up 6-1 somehow
01:47:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i agree ciaran
01:48:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i forced a beer into steve's hands so i'm not the only one drinking

01:50:44 <mikev> 2 weeks ago (edited)
01:50:44 <mikev> exellent.. ! epic  stuff , greetings from argentina !
01:51:10 <mikev> big spender shrimp with multiple arena beers
01:51:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if we lose to the devils i'm stepping in front of a train
01:51:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> 5 arena beers
01:51:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> kill me
01:51:53 <ehn> 5 beers ftw
01:52:26 <dreddybajs> one bourbon, one scotch, five beers
01:53:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've had 3 but i've bought 2 for steve
01:54:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because i am an idiot
01:54:24 <mikev> i used to bring a flask in but i don't think you can get away with that anymore
01:54:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they are the big 24oz cans
01:54:31 <mikev> i haven't been for several years now
01:54:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no you cannot
01:56:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you can bring in drugs in a bag probably
01:56:57 <mikev> lol i would just take a caplet in if i was trying to do that
01:57:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so there you go
01:58:36 <mikev> i think i'd rather be drunk at a game than high though
01:59:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have the hiccups
01:59:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ):
01:59:51 <dreddybajs> lol yeah i cant think of a drug id want to do in the stands of a game
01:59:57 <mikev> i think if you yell a lot they can go away
02:01:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> third period let's go
02:01:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if we lose, farewell
02:05:12 <dreddybajs> what if instead of johgn lee hooker
02:05:13 <dreddybajs> there was
02:05:16 <dreddybajs> john lee cena
02:09:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> i was watching a seth vid and this card is actually good https://scryfall.com/card/neo/124/tribute-to-horobi-echo-of-deaths-wail
02:11:11 <dreddybajs> cool card
02:11:17 <dreddybajs> idk if i understand the flavour but yeah
02:12:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> i need to put this in my rats deck
02:12:45 <dreddybajs> oh yeah nice
02:13:07 <dreddybajs> i guess in multiplayer though Homie_in_a_geod all your opponents will just attack the rats into one another
02:13:11 <dreddybajs> so you dont get them at the end
02:13:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they got danny devito to make a cheer video
02:13:20 <dreddybajs> danny devito ftw
02:13:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i fucking hate the devild
02:13:31 <dreddybajs> this game sounds very fun shrimp1989dspinfo 
02:13:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean maybe, i still get a 3/3 hasty flyer with upside at the end of all that
02:14:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> also because of summoning sickness im going to get some back no matter what i think
02:14:26 <dreddybajs> yeah a couple
02:14:33 <dreddybajs> actually yeah a lot
02:14:33 <dreddybajs> lol
02:14:39 <dreddybajs> pretty good now i think about it
02:15:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> everyone thought this card was trash when it was spoiled but seth played against someone using it in standard and its actually really sick in an aggro deck
02:15:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> its still a 25c rare and i dont expect it will ever be a money card but it is definitely playable
02:16:16 <dreddybajs> giving them 2 blockers as your t2 play seems very bad in an aggro deck to m
02:16:17 <dreddybajs> e
02:16:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> it seemed like that to me too but they were playing cheap evasive stuff
02:17:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> that attacked around the rats
02:17:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> then they got them all back and refueled with the sac ability
02:17:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> just realized a nice synergy here
02:17:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/198582/magic-throne-of-eldraine-piper-of-the-swarm?Language=English
02:17:59 <dreddybajs> oh yea nice
02:18:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> ideally you dont want to be pouring your rat colonies into this ability or really pouring mana into making rats with piper so these work really nice together
02:19:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> tom let's go to a ploff game if it's avs v rangers
02:19:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> also if you take control of a commander and protect it they can't recast
02:19:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> ok shrimp1989dspinfo the one problem with that is if that does happen it will be in the stanley cup finals and so the tickets will be literal thousands of dollars
02:19:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
02:19:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yes
02:20:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i am aware
02:20:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> i do not expect the rangers will be getting there anyway but im happy to be proven wrong
02:20:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> rangers-pens is like, practically already locked in for the first round and i think rangers should do well there but after that theyll probably have to play carolina
02:21:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i do not have much confidence in that matchup
02:21:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> matchup
02:21:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmao
02:21:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> ketchup

02:27:08 <dreddybajs> maybe devils are my team...
02:27:24 <mikev> lmao keith tkachuk looks like a thumb rn
02:27:29 <mikev> he's gotten fatter
02:28:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> rangers are, naturally, getting lit up
02:28:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i will kill you ciaran
02:28:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> guess who's in goal and whether it's igor shesterkin
02:28:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> (it is not)
02:29:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> alexandar georgiev is so fuckin bad lol
02:30:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> i cant remember a time the rangers had such a stiff for a backup goalie
02:30:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> they had pavelec a few years ago but he was actually fine
02:32:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmao the backup goaltending sucked this year but lundqvist played in 73 games https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/NYR/2010.html
02:37:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> alright.
02:37:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> farewell everyone
02:49:11 <mikev> gnight
03:02:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i can't believe we lost to the devils

05:23:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i bought a big case when i was at mitsuwa
05:23:48 <bonegar> nice
05:23:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> steve said we'd hang out next month lol
05:23:54 <bonegar> i prefer it in the cans over the bottles too
05:24:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i never get bottles
05:24:16 <bonegar> the bottles are just okay but the cans just taste way better imo
05:24:18 <mikev> orion :)
05:24:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when they sold it at the beers tore next to my house they had like
05:24:28 <bonegar> dang i haven't seen orion in ages
05:24:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the massive barrel caans
05:24:35 <mikev> i had it at a ramen plac ein chicago
05:24:36 <bonegar> yeea orion is good because it tastes exactly like asahi
05:24:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so i'd jsut get one of those
05:24:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they had sapporo too but the asahi cans were bigger
05:24:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think like 36 oz? or 40?
05:25:09 <mikev> 40 oz can would be coool
05:25:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the asahi cans i have now are small
05:25:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> 11.2 oz

12:26:54 <the`shima> Damn nice
12:26:59 <the`shima> yeah its a bit goosebumps aint it
12:27:33 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah if it was navy blue w/ yellow lines it'd be cool
12:27:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> but i dont think that yellow color would look good against my skin tone lol

12:31:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol thats a very awful picture benjo
12:50:14 <the`shima> hmm my old job finally agreed the retrospective pay deal for 21/22 so im gonna get £300 payed for months i worked there
12:50:41 <the`shima> maybe time to get a ps5 though i looked at elden ring/ff7r footage and it didnt look like a massive jump for those at least
12:50:45 <the`shima> gt7 looks nuts tho
13:01:32 <the_tasteful_nerd> elden ring looks really good imo but its still pretty clear it wasn't solely developed for next gen
13:02:17 <the`shima> do you have one i dont remember
13:02:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah
13:02:52 <the_tasteful_nerd> if you can get a ps5 without a lot of hassle go for it
13:03:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> otherwise wait on it
13:05:10 <the`shima> ya i can pay like 70% of the cost or so and i just gotta keep an eyeo ut for one 
13:05:24 <the`shima> i guess its one of those purchases thats just gonna hang around for like 7 years or something too so
13:09:30 <the_tasteful_nerd> .l
13:10:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah idk how it is over there but you still have to wait for drops here
13:10:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> and increasingly you have to pay a retailer some subscription fee to even have access to the drops
13:11:25 <the`shima> ya i think the subscription thing here is a no no but you gotta be fast af
13:12:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah i just happened to get lucky w/ a gamestop drop

14:00:24 <Nude_Riker> scoop_jackson, no details yet but thoughts on the crypto xo incoming
14:00:33 <Nude_Riker> regulation means here to stay...
14:02:19 <scoop_jackson> Can you rephrase that I’m confused
14:03:04 <Nude_Riker> biden is supposed to issue an executive order saying "we need a plan to regulate cryptocurrency"
14:03:15 <Nude_Riker> just wondering if you had any thoughts about it
14:03:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> crypto oppresses gamers and should be banned

14:05:56 <scoop_jackson> I think crypto will have a rough time of it during this monetary tightening cycle
14:06:05 <scoop_jackson> Probably more important than whatever Biden says
14:07:12 <Nude_Riker> i need to get of my ass and set up those investments, surely keeping all of my money in a savings account will be worse during a "monetary tightening cycle"
14:08:57 <scoop_jackson> i mean if they tighten too much than cash is king
14:09:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> withdraw your money from your savings acct and bury it in jars in the backyard
14:10:29 <Nude_Riker> money in a bank... thats not cash... shrimp1989dspinfo is right
14:10:32 <Nude_Riker> i need to buy gold
14:10:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ^
14:11:14 <the_tasteful_nerd> i must buy gold
14:12:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> cash ftw
14:13:14 <the_tasteful_nerd> except when it loses value ftl
14:13:39 <scoop_jackson> there are  a lot of bizarre goldbug rumors floating around
14:14:16 <scoop_jackson> kinda related, but for a long time there were rumors that jpm was rigging the silver market which i didnt take terribly seriously because i dont really think about silver
14:14:25 <scoop_jackson> but then it turned out they were rigging the silver market

14:29:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the what
14:29:46 <mpg> lol nm its from the movie
14:29:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> talented mr ripley is cool
14:29:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> purple noon is better though, imo
14:29:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i haven't seen it yet!!!
14:30:04 <Nude_Riker> i have not seen either of those movie
14:30:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm gonig to watch mystic river later this week
14:30:17 <the_tasteful_nerd> theyre adapation of same book
14:30:25 <the_tasteful_nerd> im gonna save you some time: dont watch mystic river lol
14:30:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i kept calling it mystic pizza but htat's an entirely different movie
14:30:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> steve said he wouldn't watch it with me because it's extremely depressing
14:30:56 <Nude_Riker> lol
14:30:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> unless you really wanna see funny histrionics that for some reason won oscars
14:31:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i know nothing about it and he laughed at the imdb description
14:31:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> The lives of three men who were childhood friends are shattered when one of them has a family tragedy.
14:31:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we watched primal fear yesterday and i liked the ending
14:31:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think that it was the only way it could have ended successfully
14:32:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i will watch purple noon sometime after the talented mr ripley and compare
14:35:46 <mpg> primal fear was cool as hell at the time it was released
14:36:32 <mpg> i used to mix that up with the movie fear, released around the same time, which was not good
14:38:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> i think primal fear has not aged well but 
14:38:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
14:38:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> fear kicked ass
14:38:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> it definitely launched ed norton big time
14:38:30 <the_tasteful_nerd> ive never seen fear
14:38:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> mark wahlberg is a fucking freak
14:38:33 <the_tasteful_nerd> i should see that sometime
14:38:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the way he kisses is the most psychotic thing i've ever seen
14:38:53 <mpg> lol
14:39:04 <mpg> i think it was mark wahlberg's first movie
14:39:04 <mpg> iirc
14:39:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> another movie that is exclusively in the realm of 'watch when drunk' which i will never see becasuse im not drunk
14:39:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> hey Nude_Riker how close are you to this place https://www.google.com/maps/place/3606+Chestnut+Ave,+Baltimore,+MD+21211/@39.3318072,-76.6318512,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c80527dfe8c91d:0x2047305ce7b2bd4f!8m2!3d39.3318031!4d-76.6296625?shorturl=1
14:39:49 <Nude_Riker> like a ten minute walk
14:39:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> steve said that primal fear looked like an 80s movie despite being released in 96
14:40:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> which isn't necessarily a bad thing

14:45:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
14:45:58 <mpg> yeah thats true
14:46:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> so you only get good results when you lean into who he is
14:46:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> like in boogie nights
14:46:25 <the_tasteful_nerd> hes good in boogie nights because PTA understood exactly what kind of dumb guy he is, and thats the character

16:02:11 <alansmithee_> tbh i think mine mostly was but it felt like i was lacking. switched to try to use the sword of night and fire and hated it. so now i'm running dual katanas
16:02:23 <alansmithee_> and i need optimization cause i suck
16:02:37 <the_tasteful_nerd> damn woe is playing live in bklyn and philly for the first time since 2019
16:02:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> but thats it for now

16:08:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> -_-
16:08:39 <bonegar> :smiling imp emoji:
16:08:42 <mpg> alansmithee_: everyone goes nuts over that sword
16:08:58 <mpg> the real OP move is frost stomp
16:09:09 <mpg> that shit has been carrying me through some tough areas
16:09:11 <bonegar> i love the stomps so much
16:09:15 <bonegar> feels so bad ass to do
16:09:18 <mpg> yeah
16:09:30 <alansmithee_> yeah i was watching someone on stream doing the summoning and a bunch of people were using frost stomp lol
16:09:37 <mpg> twice in a row will usually inflict a huge amount of frost damage too
16:09:44 <bonegar> i dont think i've found frost stomp yet
16:10:01 <mpg> you can get it as an ash of war, and also there is an ice axe that has it
16:10:04 <bonegar> im kinda at the point in the game where i might start checking the 'wiki' for hints on items/quests i've missed because i've missed a ton just running around
16:10:07 <alansmithee_> and i think the sword is probably good but at a higher level. the fact that you gotta have 24fai/24int means a lot of relatively dead stats early on
16:10:28 <mpg> yeah it's a goofy stat sword tbh
16:10:29 <bonegar> im int/faith build so i would love to find this sword
16:10:38 <mpg> it's in the caria manor
16:10:41 <bonegar> went int/faith before i knew it existed
16:10:42 <alansmithee_> yeah
16:10:45 <bonegar> awesome thanks i'll hunt for it today
16:10:47 <mpg> you have to do some roof parkour to get to it
16:11:00 <bonegar> couldnt figure out how to get into the manor
16:11:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm gonna dump a bunch of stat points in int because i want to use glintstone sorcery i think
16:11:18 <bonegar> all those nasty big hands or w/e
16:11:21 <alansmithee_> yeah basically there's a point where instead of going to the boss, you go to a dead end path and jump down a roof, then another and then you find the chest
16:11:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm still mad about the shitty dragon spell
16:11:28 <bonegar> the sorcery in this game is so damn cool
16:11:29 <alansmithee_> i just ran past the hands
16:11:29 <mpg> yeah those hands can fuck off
16:11:44 <bonegar> i spent a few hours killing them 
16:11:45 <mpg> i bully the hands now but before they would kick the shit out of me
16:11:45 <alansmithee_> shrimp1989dspinfo: you have the meteorite staff? 
16:11:46 <bonegar> because i hate them
16:11:57 <alansmithee_> yeah the hands are gross so i ran by them
16:12:16 <dreddybajs> hate the hands
16:12:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> alansmithee_ i have two glintstone staffs but idr the names
16:12:21 <alansmithee_> tbh at first when i saw the dumb land octopus i thought i would kill gross enemies but now i run by them so i don't look at them
16:12:24 <bonegar> yea there are so many places i just like.. run by that i need to go back to and explore
16:12:35 <mpg> totally
16:12:37 <alansmithee_> meteorite staff is something you can get early that's S scaling on int
16:12:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm gonna play in a bit
16:12:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'll check then
16:12:54 <bonegar> that was like the first item i found
16:12:55 <dreddybajs> yeah i think you cant improve it though alansmithee_ 
16:12:57 <bonegar> the meteorite staff
16:13:01 <mpg> one of my fav things to do is run past everything, get all the treasures, and come back later when i'm OP and just stomp the fuck out of everything
16:13:04 <dreddybajs> i think its in one of the early caves
16:13:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have a staff that dropped off a demi-human queen or something
16:13:11 <alansmithee_> yeah i don't think you can. it's good for early/mid but other stuff is later
16:13:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and another one
16:13:19 <bonegar> yea mpg, except i forget where i found the treasures or what the areas were lol
16:13:19 <alansmithee_> it's in the dumb swamp in the hell area
16:13:19 <mpg> shrimp1989dspinfo: that's a good staff
16:13:24 <mpg> i use that staff
16:13:35 <bonegar> its a great staff yea
16:13:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my character is low int so this is gonna take a while lol
16:13:37 <alansmithee_> demihuman queen is better late i think cause it can be improved
16:13:50 <bonegar> good for low-medium int builds
16:14:16 <mpg> yah that's what i use if for
16:14:24 <mpg> it was doing a lot of ranged attacks for me early on
16:14:31 <bonegar> yea the demihuman queen one is a good warrior one
16:14:38 <bonegar> like i think it's only 10 or 14 int
16:15:00 <bonegar> so you can get some of the basic spooky gravity spells for warriors and be a huge scary black knight demon
16:15:04 <alansmithee_> i'm wondering if i should even try the guy at redmane castle. i saw some dude on youtube said he beat him ariound my level with all the summons or w/e but i also would probably be frustrated by all the instagib moves
16:15:14 <NORG> .qsearch ass
16:15:17 <mpg> the pest threads spell is insanely OP
16:15:35 <alansmithee_> apparently one  of the best spells is glintstone pebble lol
16:15:35 <mpg> i saw dist just roll through some big bosses with it
16:15:46 <mpg> it's really fast
16:15:47 <mpg> at least
16:15:50 <mpg> so you can get a bunch off
16:15:54 <alansmithee_> just because it's the most fp efficient to damage
16:15:58 <bonegar> glintstone pebble is great
16:16:05 <mpg> good for interrupting attackers
16:16:11 <mpg> and interrupting spell casts
16:16:32 <bonegar> my fav one is probably the sword spell that summons a sword at a delay then fires it like a homing missile
16:16:35 <alansmithee_> did anyone fight the dude in the poison castle? the briar guy? 
16:16:37 <bonegar> so useful
16:16:39 <mpg> yeah bonegar
16:16:43 <mpg> that one carried me for a long time
16:16:50 <bonegar> yea still my main driver
16:17:05 <bonegar> but i'm kinda like 'stuck' atm. been exploring and not  getting levels for like 2 days
16:17:19 <bonegar> kinda why i am thinking about checking a guide briefly for some stuff
16:17:23 <mpg> exploring is the best part tbh
16:17:26 <bonegar> just getting very inefficient
16:17:34 <bonegar> yea but i'm feeling like i need to make some more progress w/ my guy
16:17:35 <alansmithee_> oh i've been looking at guides to find things 
16:17:38 <mpg> killing bosses is cool and all but the world is so huge and glorious
16:17:47 <bonegar> i've played almost the whole game blind so far
16:18:18 <mpg> hell i might have to fire it up soon
16:18:30 <alansmithee_> yeah talking has me wanting to play lol
16:18:35 <mpg> i'm "stuck" on radahn right now, he is very fucking annoying
16:18:42 <bonegar> he's so fucking hard
16:18:42 <mpg> it's a pretty wack fight
16:18:47 <bonegar> my friend basically carried me through it lmao
16:18:54 <alansmithee_> yeah that's where i'm at now
16:18:59 <bonegar> he's supposed to be a pivotal fight though
16:19:00 <mpg> i watched a video of a guy no-hitting him with two +7 wolverine claws
16:19:06 <mpg> it was incredible
16:19:21 <alansmithee_> i've opened up a bunch of areas tho, but i keep getting bodied in a bunch of them lol
16:19:30 <bonegar> yea lol
16:19:32 <mpg> yeah
16:19:32 <alansmithee_> what level are you about,, mpg? 
16:19:36 <mpg> 82
16:19:43 <bonegar> for awhile i was just running into areas, wiping, then running to new ones because There Is So Damn Much
16:19:48 <alansmithee_> oh shit
16:19:51 <mpg> i managed to get myself up to the altus plateau and into the city
16:19:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> this mtg youtube guy looks like such fuckin shit in his video thumbnails lmao
16:19:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/XhEuGFZZ/image.png
16:19:58 <mpg> and there are a ton of like run 12s there
16:20:00 <alansmithee_> i was thinking of fighting him at 52
16:20:02 <mpg> also
16:20:06 <bonegar> lol
16:20:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
16:20:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> he looks less shitty than that when hes like, talking and moving around. why would you use that picture on purpose lmao
16:20:23 <bonegar> i would guess most mtg guys are probably in their 40s
16:20:28 <mpg> i did the speedrunner move of killing the tree monsters, and the popping a golden claw as they are in their death animation
16:20:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> whats your definition of 'mtg guy' there
16:20:53 <mpg> it gives you a huge boost to how many runes you get
16:20:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> most mtg content people i know about are definitely in their 30s
16:21:08 <alansmithee_> also apparentlyl there's a  charm that gives 20% bonus runes or something
16:21:15 <mpg> yeah the gold scarab
16:21:25 <alansmithee_> which i should get but ehh
16:21:27 <mpg> and, the gold scarab and the gold claw stack
16:21:27 <bonegar> just guessing given the age of the game
16:21:33 <alansmithee_> i figure i'd lose the runes anyways
16:21:53 <mpg> so if you pop a claw and then use the scarab after killing a big boss you can get a fuck ton of runes
16:21:59 <alansmithee_> that's sweet
16:22:08 <mpg> makes leveling up a lot easier
16:22:33 <mpg> however the down side is if you want to craft golden claws, you basically have to murder a bunch of penguins
16:22:36 <mpg> which i won't do
16:22:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> thank you
16:22:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> eh i mean guys who were playing in the mid 90s are in their 40s or higher probably but
16:23:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> not that many people were playing back then
16:23:06 <bonegar> i would just guess most mtg guys are older given the age of the game, but i would also guess most people who got into the content game are going to be millenials
16:23:19 <this_fellow_kermit> what if instead of the ruins of beverast it was the ruins of beverage
16:23:22 <bonegar> just  various things i would be guessing about 
16:23:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> every mtg event ive been to in the last like 5 years was mostly guys around my age
16:24:00 <bonegar> how old is the guy you linked
16:24:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> that guys probably mid 40s but he also talks about when he was playing in 1993 so
16:24:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> he was a very early adopter
16:24:31 <mpg> 1993 is like unlimited era
16:24:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
16:24:35 <mpg> cool
16:24:36 <alansmithee_> mpg yeah i feel that lol. like i found out you can kinda cheese the big dragon in dragonbarrow to kill it but it's like...why? 
16:24:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> i saw one video where he was talking about playing with the ante cards
16:24:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> back when that was a thing
16:24:57 <this_fellow_kermit> .l
16:25:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> if you were playing with ante cards youve gotta be fairly old
16:25:03 <this_fellow_kermit> Lohe
16:25:08 <alansmithee_> ante cards were a thing up until like 4th or th ed i think? at least revised
16:25:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> that's still very early
16:25:27 <mpg> alansmithee_: the dragon on the bridge in caelid give you 95k runes
16:25:36 <mpg> if you pop a gold claw, you will get almost 200k
16:25:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> all teh ante cards were banned in jan 1994
16:25:40 <bonegar> nfts probably make sense for magic the gathering online gaming 
16:25:41 <alansmithee_> which one is that? 
16:25:44 <scoop_jackson> 4th edition it was in the revised rule book
16:25:49 <bonegar> maybe the only correct usecase i can think of for nfts
16:25:51 <dreddybajs> fuck yeah, loretta down first try
16:25:56 <scoop_jackson> er ante was in the 4th edition rule book
16:25:56 <alansmithee_> nice!
16:25:56 <mpg> alansmithee_: i forget the name, something black dragon
16:26:19 <alansmithee_> i tried fighting some dumb dragon in caelid and got wrecked
16:26:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
16:26:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> they printed some ante cards into 1995 though (in homelands)
16:26:29 <alansmithee_> scarlet rot and stuff
16:26:32 <scoop_jackson> lol homelands
16:26:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> i tried to fight the erdtree there and he owned me
16:26:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> homelands, the worst set
16:26:38 <mpg> yeah that dragon sucks alan
16:26:48 <mpg> homelands is def the worst
16:26:52 <mpg> it used to be fallen empires
16:26:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> the most valuable card in homelands is like $20, even now
16:26:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
16:26:58 <mpg> ice age was also not great
16:26:59 <scoop_jackson> i quit during homelands big mistake to miss out on alliances
16:27:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> fallen empires also sucks but there are some usable cards
16:27:10 <alansmithee_> the_tasteful_nerd: yeah i got owned by the endtree there too
16:27:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> some ice age cards are actually really valuable now
16:27:16 <mpg> huh that's nuts
16:27:28 <mpg> they reprinted icy manipulator in ice age but its weird and different
16:27:33 <alansmithee_> ice age had one of the most powerful cards ever, at least for a long time
16:27:39 <scoop_jackson> hymn to torach ftw
16:27:43 <mpg> oh yes
16:27:44 <scoop_jackson> necropotence ?
16:27:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have a FE hymn to tourach
16:27:47 <alansmithee_> yeah
16:27:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> in one of my decks
16:27:54 <mpg> that's a great one
16:27:59 <mpg> i have 4 of those
16:28:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> the dark was always considered a shit set but there are a couple 100+ dollar cards in it
16:28:15 <scoop_jackson> the one functional deck i have has 4 hymns in it
16:28:17 <mpg> the dark is cool tho
16:28:19 <the_tasteful_nerd> .qsearch nuts
16:28:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> city of shadows and goblin wizard
16:28:34 <alansmithee_> it's funny, sealed boxes go for boatloads even tho the cards aren't valuable in a lot of those sets
16:28:36 <mpg> back in the day legends was the coolest set
16:28:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> necropotence is the most valuable ice age card but its gotten repreints
16:28:40 <mpg> and arabian nights of course
16:28:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> legends is still cool
16:28:52 <alansmithee_> Homie_in_a_geod: i think actually now it's like jesters mask or something
16:28:56 <mpg> arabian nights has some insane expensive cards now
16:28:59 <mpg> that djinn
16:29:05 <alansmithee_> cause necro's been reprinted so much and the mask is reserved list
16:29:06 <mpg> i forget which one, with the cool art
16:29:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> not according to the mtggoldfish price list im looking at
16:29:13 <dreddybajs> juzam djinn i think
16:29:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> .qsearch nuts
16:29:15 <mpg> yeah
16:29:17 <mpg> juzam

16:29:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> arabian nights has a bunch of 1000+ dollar cards
16:29:32 <scoop_jackson> jesters mask is valuable?
16:29:33 <mpg> i saw a juzam going for like $80k
16:29:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> bazaar is more than that lol
16:29:36 <scoop_jackson> i think i have one of those

17:18:44 <NORG> lol
17:21:29 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah i dunno where to begin w/ the nick obfuscation unless theres a function someone's written somewhere i can just steal
17:22:01 <the_tasteful_nerd> ive wasted too much of my life on this thing for one day though
17:28:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l
17:28:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk where i found out about this but its cool
17:29:25 <the`shima> ugh god this one person is work is extremely annoying
17:30:09 <the`shima> we're making a bunch of tools that show data for differnet parts of the city using known statistical boundaries and she's like "theres a lot of people in this one area so can we move like 5% of them into another area"
17:30:45 <the`shima> which is akin to being like "can you please make this model but also draw a tiny bit of california different so it includes a few more towns. also change new york slightly"
17:31:08 <the`shima> its doing my head in lol
17:33:26 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
17:33:36 <bonegar> even asking 'which 5%?' is very funny
17:34:05 <scoop_jackson> Good way to train yourself to become a professional gerrymander
17:34:20 <scoop_jackson> Gerrymanderer
17:34:30 <the`shima> its because she wants to distribute her staff evenly across the areas and im like "well cant you just ask somebody to drop into the area thats bigger to help out. breaking this whole model that utilises known statistical boundaries is not the right decision" and shes like "Nope. Can't do that"
17:34:42 <the`shima> fundamentally an idiot lol
17:36:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah
17:36:18 <the_tasteful_nerd> pick a different model 
17:36:29 <the_tasteful_nerd> a model that isnt "the way i want the data to look"
17:36:35 <the`shima> ya
17:37:03 <het> the`shima: that sounds immensely frustrating
17:37:04 <the`shima> i wouldn't usually be so pissed off about something like this but we spent like 20 hours hand holding and helping her with this stuff, going far beyond our actual roles
17:37:38 <the`shima> and then she just spoke to one of her staff who was like "my area is too big we need to change it" and she just came back with that and wont budge now
17:38:15 <the`shima> i get the sense she is trying to avoid having to do this properly and deflect responsibility
17:39:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> 12:01 PM <Homie_in_a_geod> there were a lot of insane scores in the nhl yesterday

17:54:33 <bonegar> just talking about good things that we have had our fill of
17:54:56 <the`shima> the best talking heads song is this
17:55:21 <scoop_jackson> when i was kid my parents played this bullshit van morrison live album too many times on road trips so i still hate van morrison
17:55:33 <scoop_jackson> but im still okay with talking heads and fleetwood mac
17:55:34 <the`shima> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExVHWWzEAww
17:55:49 <scoop_jackson> which were also overplayed
17:56:09 <mpg> i dont like talking heads enough to have strong opinions about them one way or another
17:56:12 <bonegar> i remember listening to astral weeks a lot and being like 'wow who is this guy i have never heard of. big discovery.' lmao
17:56:26 <mpg> and the only fleetwood mac song ive enjoyed is the most overplayed one of them all
17:56:50 <Rusty> .y van morrison latest record project
17:56:53 <scoop_jackson> i like em both, good bands to connect with normies on
17:56:58 <bonegar> .yt fleetwood mac what makes you think you're the one
17:57:26 <mpg> theyre fine i wouldnt say i like them tho
17:57:37 <mpg> its not like billie joel who i actively dislike
17:57:46 <the`shima> billy joel. the worst of all
17:57:50 <scoop_jackson> agreed on billy joel
17:58:03 <the`shima> what fleetwood mac song is that mpg
17:58:39 <bonegar> i would pretend to like billy joel to impress someone's mother from long island
17:58:42 <bonegar> that's about it
17:58:42 <the`shima> i think tango in the night is an excellent album but most of the rest of fleetwood mac i can miss. except maybe 'the chain' which rules
17:59:09 <dreddybajs> the chain is one of the worst karaoke songs though
17:59:11 <dreddybajs> it's so repetitive

18:08:12 <dreddybajs> when my friends did it with mdma they called it fizzy bum time
18:09:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> supervisor 10 mins late for our weekly meeting
18:09:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> good job
18:10:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> one time a while ago she like scolded me for not letting her know that our meeting that she scheduled was already due to have started
18:10:04 <registered_mirc> take his job
18:10:08 <registered_mirc> her
18:10:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> wow mpg, scared of a powerful girlboss much
18:10:37 <registered_mirc> no actually i want the girlboss to step on my balls
18:11:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> nice.
18:11:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> .gis fart'n 'n' shit'n
18:11:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
18:11:53 <Rusty> i get to set up a RAID 1 array tonight. fun times ahead
18:12:12 <registered_mirc> check out sheldon over here
18:12:37 <registered_mirc> i setup a RAID once and it wasnt really hard
18:12:45 <registered_mirc> it might take you 20 minutes
18:12:47 <Rusty> yeah i'm not super worried, i forget how many drive bays i have in my case tho
18:12:54 <Rusty> we'll see tonight i guess
18:13:11 <registered_mirc> is it jumper configuration
18:13:20 <registered_mirc> or a bios thing
18:13:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> we had a leak in our celing and people came over to 'fix' it but they needed to get new parts and stuff so a couple parts of the ceiling are still opened up and currently covered with plastic bags fixed in place with painters' tape
18:13:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> said bags are currently pooling up with water thanks to the fact that it is fuckin sleeting here
18:13:42 <Rusty> no clue! i'm just trying to consolidate all my hoarded media so i picked up two identical 18TB drives
18:13:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> this seems suboptimal
18:13:58 <registered_mirc> ahhh that's quite a lot of space!
18:14:02 <registered_mirc> i should do that tbh
18:14:11 <registered_mirc> instead of having two non-raided 6tb drives
18:14:15 <Rusty> yeah i've been walking on thin ice for too long w/r/t old drives
18:14:19 <dreddybajs> damn how much that cost ya Rusty 
18:14:26 <Rusty> $317 each on newegg
18:14:31 <registered_mirc> not bad
18:14:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> whats gonna get raided is ya moms panties bitch
18:14:34 <dreddybajs> nice
18:14:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> thanks for randomly logging me out
18:14:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> irccloud
18:14:52 <registered_mirc> alpha tom
18:14:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> get off chat or ill have you bat
18:15:02 <registered_mirc> alpha dog G
18:15:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dont think you need to do any sort of bios/jumper stuff anymore to do a cloned drive partition
18:15:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> most OS have that built in
18:15:50 <Rusty> yeah i was just gonna follow some win10 tutorial probably
18:15:50 <registered_mirc> i'm showing how old my raid knowledge is
18:15:52 <registered_mirc> lol
18:16:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> im glad i bought a bunch of these lands in foil https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/253435/magic-innistrad-crimson-vow-swamp-272?Language=English
18:16:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> they look so sick in foil
18:16:40 <registered_mirc> the only time ive ever setup raids was building servers for the dial-up ISP i worked for which were raided and had the first intel xeons
18:16:40 <Rusty> that looks dope yeah
18:16:48 <Rusty> lol nice
18:17:07 <registered_mirc> until recently i saw not point to having raided drives at home
18:17:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> theyre still only going for $1 apiece foil in some places
18:17:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> severely underrated lands
18:17:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> in the nas it's nice
18:17:41 <Nude_Riker> someone just uploaded a lecture titled "The Wigger's Diagram" to our video library
18:17:48 <Rusty> hmmmmmmm
18:17:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> to have 4 drives and if any of them fail you're fine
18:18:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> another land cyle that is underrated are the mh2 foil etched basics
18:18:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> nothing else really looks like them
18:18:24 <registered_mirc> ive only had 1 hard drive ever fail on me my whole life
18:18:29 <registered_mirc> so i dont have that anxiety i guess
18:18:54 <registered_mirc> i used to back up everything on dvd pretty regular up
18:18:54 <bonegar> i've lost a few, but they were entirely someone elses fault
18:19:00 <registered_mirc> til like 2012
18:19:11 <Rusty> only ever had an external get corrupted. i still need to try and pull shit off that thing
18:19:32 <registered_mirc> i have a hard drive that has stuff on it that i want that is extremely broken and "unrecoverable" according to one company
18:19:35 <Rusty> all my ghastly undergrad film papers
18:19:36 <registered_mirc> sucks
18:19:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> oh ive had many drives fail
18:20:03 <registered_mirc> Nude_Riker: lmfao
18:20:22 <registered_mirc> i guess i've just been very lucky with my comptuers
18:20:31 <registered_mirc> have not experienced a ton of data loss
18:20:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> it only has to happen a few times to make u very wary of it
18:20:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> depending on what u lose
18:20:57 <registered_mirc> i would say i'm more at risk now than ever since i stoped trying to organize my shit meticulously
18:21:15 <registered_mirc> but i have files dating back to 2001 at least
18:21:21 <scoop_jackson> yeah the cloud has made me lazy
18:21:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> and once its set up its a little more hands off than like cloning a drive every few months or we
18:21:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the wigger's diagram
18:21:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my hdd in my laptop died which was very sad
18:21:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think this was the first time
18:21:48 <registered_mirc> i've never had to clone a drive before really
18:21:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> happened a few months ago
18:21:55 <registered_mirc> not aside from having an image
18:21:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so i got a big boy thinkpad
18:21:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> well you know what i mean
18:22:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> the external i used to have all my mp3s on died while was doing my radio show in college in 2012
18:22:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> "back up the shit on one drive on another"
18:22:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> never got it working again and didnt have a backup
18:22:21 <registered_mirc> i really should do that
18:22:25 <Rusty> damn
18:22:28 <bonegar> having very bad memories about gettin in a fight with someone because I said i wanted to 'back up my files' then just copied them onto like a google cloud drive, which is 'REDUNCANCY NOT BACKING UP'
18:22:33 <bonegar> terrible memory
18:22:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have a ~14 year old external hdd  that is somehow still alive and well
18:22:36 <registered_mirc> im yoloing my data life right now because ive had such good luck
18:22:52 <scoop_jackson> that suks tom
18:22:59 <registered_mirc> shrimp1989dspinfo: that is something i would absolutely dupe everything on that drive to dropbox
18:23:02 <the_tasteful_nerd> i mean, most data isnt that big of a deal to lose
18:23:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> mp3s and movies can generall be recovered
18:23:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i bought another external and copied everytihng over to it
18:23:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> and theres plenty of cloud shit for ur real important shit
18:23:25 <scoop_jackson> NOT THE RARE DISCO RAP MP3S THAT SOULMAN UPLOADED
18:23:26 <registered_mirc> the stuff that got lost on my drive is fairly unrecoverable sadly
18:23:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i'm just like astounded that it's still running
18:23:29 <bonegar> then i got bullied into some kind of weird software backing up service that would like connect to my computer and upload stuff converting it into weird files or something...
18:23:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> scoop_jackson: i mostly listened to music on an ipod at that time still and most of the stuff i liked was still on there
18:23:33 <bonegar> hated it all so much
18:23:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> so i backfilled with that
18:23:41 <registered_mirc> music my friends made that is lost to time now
18:23:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah thats the stuff u wanna have in several spots
18:23:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> i lost plenty of stuff i will never think about again 
18:24:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> i lost a bunch of music that people on the DC++ hub i frequented made, all of which was completely shit
18:24:21 <registered_mirc> i saved the drive in the hope one day someone will be able to get it
18:24:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> but thats the music i lost that i think about the most
18:24:31 <Rusty> DC++ ftw
18:24:36 <Rusty> i miss my college hub
18:24:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> just because it doesnt exist anywhere and i could never find it again if i tried
18:24:38 <registered_mirc> and i swear i made an image of the data and the main thing that is fucked up are the headers
18:25:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> a really funny thing that someone in the dc++ hub made, that i would listen to sometimes to laugh, was a really horrible dubstep remix of the mario theme titled "Techno Mario"
18:25:14 <registered_mirc> im thinking about all the weird napster electronic music that was mislabelled that i'll never find again
18:25:52 <scoop_jackson> lol
18:26:41 <Rusty> ja ich heiße techno mario
18:26:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> there was some guy who called himself Microwave (not the microwave with the hot mom) who made some weird and pretty bad music but i still think about it sometimes
18:26:42 <registered_mirc> now im thinking about audiogalaxy
18:26:44 <registered_mirc> remember audiogalaxy
18:26:59 <bonegar> wow
18:27:03 <bonegar> audiogalaxy
18:27:04 <Rusty> i remember it all. audiogalaxy, WinMX, BearShare
18:27:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> i never used audiogalaxy but i remember it by its name
18:27:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> i definitely remember bearshare
18:27:22 <registered_mirc> i discovered a lot of cool experimental electronic music on audiogalaxy
18:27:22 <bonegar> i used napster/audiogalaxy and never bothered with limewire and the worse ones
18:27:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/pisscop/status/277623321779118080

18:39:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> its raspberry lemonade flavvor
18:39:37 <Rusty> ohh i had that one
18:39:58 <the_tasteful_nerd> maybe its not that new but i saw it for the first time at the grocery store this week
18:40:20 <scoop_jackson> for some reason i thought you didnt drink soda
18:45:27 -!- robophiz [~robophiz@B8C50673.F3C7BB78.33CA7D1E.IP] has joined #phiz
18:46:51 <bonegar> so many keywords
18:46:57 <bonegar> grooming, gaslighting, weaponizing
18:47:12 <bonegar> what the frick conor
18:47:43 <Nude_Riker> explains why he posted on ig the other day "hey im moving back to maine and selling everything"
18:47:54 <bonegar> oh this is a real person?
18:48:12 <Nude_Riker> yeah, old Weird Twitter alum
18:48:30 <Nude_Riker> i had lunch with him once
18:48:56 <bonegar> nobody who does jokes should be in a relationship
18:49:53 <bonegar> 'tried to invoke sympathy'
18:49:57 <bonegar> are you a wizard nance?
18:50:17 <bonegar> without looking i'm assuming both these people are terrible
18:51:14 <bonegar> firstly, you want to evoke, not invoke sympathy
18:51:21 <bonegar> but i think perhaps they were trying to provoke
18:51:27 <Nude_Riker> idk anything about her other than after they'd been together awhile she followed me on ig
18:51:38 <bonegar> yea entirely judging 100% of everything off of these words
18:52:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol bonegar i'm also laughing at hte keywords
18:52:18 <Nude_Riker> https://twitter.com/beefytopdog/status/1501581900779077633
18:52:33 <bonegar> yea it's like a PR presser
18:52:44 <Nude_Riker> she lives in los angeles and seems to be very much like that so makes sense
18:54:24 <bonegar> one thing i do not miss about california is having to codeswitch into PR-Therapy-Idpol Speak
18:54:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
18:54:43 <bonegar> but you're right it's probably just more of a normal way of talking for many people
18:55:46 <Nude_Riker> also like, typing out a Statement is tough and falling back on stock language makes it easier
18:55:53 <bonegar> yea
18:56:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> i love jargon
18:56:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> why even make a statement in the first place
18:57:02 <bonegar> i mean...
18:57:11 <bonegar> *whispering 'careful, bonegar' to myself*
18:57:22 <Nude_Riker> to let people know? because he has a lot of connections and warn others?
18:57:25 <bonegar> im.. gonna just gonna uhm... anyone eat any good snacks
18:57:29 <Nude_Riker> get ahead of what he might be telling people idk
18:57:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> idk who this guy is
18:57:43 <bonegar> yea there's lots of reasons
18:58:46 <Nude_Riker> god i hate onenote
18:58:55 <Nude_Riker> stupid fucking program
18:59:01 <bonegar> what are you using it for
18:59:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it was the default notepad program on a phone i had forever ago
18:59:49 <Nude_Riker> im using it to read things other people at work wrote
18:59:53 <Nude_Riker> i would never choose to use it
19:00:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> are you thinking of evernote danielle 
19:00:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
19:00:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yes
19:00:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> shit
19:00:30 <Nude_Riker> i dont like any of these things lol, i use notepad++ for all my note taking
19:00:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i use... notes
19:00:37 <the_tasteful_nerd> there is a onenote mobile but i dont think its been around that long
19:00:40 <bonegar> i remember having to use some sort of microsoft thing like that for a job, and it tracked all these nasty meaningless productivity metrics for small business owners to harangue you with
19:00:46 <bonegar> i think onenote was a part of that
19:00:56 <Nude_Riker> yeah luckily no one here actually looks at that crap
19:01:05 <bonegar> yeah but it's right there to be seen
19:01:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/SfZ7FOiJ/Screenshot_20220309-140055_One+UI+Home.jpg
19:01:14 <bonegar> most people ignore it, but it's stressful
19:01:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> or an actual notebook
19:01:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> for some reaosn ijust imagined the arrested development joke where everyone says "annyong" but instead they say "onenote"
19:01:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol
19:01:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we only use teams at work to share stuff and i HATE it
19:02:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah i just have like 35 notepad++ tabs open at any given time
19:02:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> one thing i need to do is point my notepad++ folder for scratch notes at my onedrive
19:02:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> so its the same on any machine
19:02:32 <Nude_Riker> we use teams and like... its not the worst ms product but it still sucks
19:02:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they switched us from sharepoint to teams for some insane reason
19:03:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i hate teams more than i hate skype and wish we could go back to skype + sharepoint
19:03:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> ur still on sharepoint
19:03:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> teams is just a frontend for sharepoint
19:03:19 <the_tasteful_nerd> for a lot of stuff
19:03:29 <alansmithee_> back to fighting the most bullshit boss i've fought in the game :/
19:03:30 <bonegar> it is in my very personal interests that sharepoint fails
19:03:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh huh 
19:03:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dont mind teams v much but it really needs some optimization
19:03:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's interesting
19:03:41 <Nude_Riker> ya
19:03:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they make us go through teams
19:03:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> it uses way more resources than it should be
19:03:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> teams is trying to be too many things at once i think
19:03:58 <Nude_Riker> having to go through teams to get to it is dumb as hell lol
19:04:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah they make you go through teams cause its easier than properly administering and organizing sharepoint
19:04:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> which is difficult
19:04:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> and you need to devote resources to
19:04:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they fired the entire IT department except for like... 5 dudes
19:04:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> for a 5000+ employee company
19:04:38 <Nude_Riker> oh nice masks are now optional at jh
19:04:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and outsourced the help desk stuff
19:04:40 <Nude_Riker> damn
19:04:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so now it's literally impossible to get anytihng fixed
19:04:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> damn its gonna rain and then snow on saturday
19:05:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> not good for fun times
19:05:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've been waiting on a lotus notes password reset for like a week lol
19:05:36 <Nude_Riker> lool
19:06:15 <scoop_jackson> Lol
19:06:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they're discontinuing lotus notes actually because they didn't want to pay for the license anymore but htey have nothing in place to replace it
19:06:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so idk how we're going to manage work requests
19:06:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think it's gone in april
19:07:05 <Nude_Riker> buying a barely used bottle of perfume from a twitter mufo, wonder if ill ever see it

19:08:27 <alansmithee_> oh nice
19:08:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when i finish creating the production versions of the contract forms i file work requests with implementation details in lotus notes
19:08:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and they're sent to the production team
19:08:59 <Nude_Riker> i got a sample of it a few years ago and loved it, then bought a "clone" that is a little too sweet (mlm no 4)
19:08:59 <alansmithee_> o
19:09:12 <alansmithee_> i've never had any of their stuff but i know they're well regarded
19:09:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> other departments use it as well but i'm not sure what they do with it
19:10:05 <Nude_Riker> alansmithee_, successful to a fault lol, in Big Cities apparently people roll their eyes at it now (mostly nyc)
19:10:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> basically everything you'd assume would be automated in the creation of health care contracts is not actually automated in my company
19:10:21 <Nude_Riker> but no one is going to smell me in hood river and go "oh... still wearing that eh"
19:10:44 <scoop_jackson> nobodyh is gonna roll your eyes at it in nyc
19:10:45 <NORG> het sorry bro
19:11:10 <het> NORG: god fucking dammit
19:11:13 <alansmithee_> lol idk like i always hear that stuff on forums but i've never heard of anyone actually anywhere caring much if you're wearing something niche that's overused
19:11:22 <Nude_Riker> yeah they'll just make a sassy tweet about it
19:11:28 <het> like shit I would have at least been curious about trubisky
19:11:43 <NORG> on the bright side it's not like washington is taking on the entire contra-ooh...oh no
19:11:48 <alansmithee_> trubisky is terrible
19:11:51 <Nude_Riker> lol het
19:12:04 <NORG> trubisky is better than wentz and not a proven team cancer
19:12:19 <alansmithee_> trubisky is in no way better than wentz lol
19:12:32 <alansmithee_> he's legit one of the worst starters i've ever seen
19:12:33 <Nude_Riker> excited to see wilson fail to make the broncos win a superbowl
19:12:40 <NORG> if you say so :P
19:12:44 <Nude_Riker> hope we get to see jerry jeudy blow up tho

19:24:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> reading that conor tripler thing and i hope that person is ok but also i uhhhhh well. idk
19:25:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> where do people go to take classes on the Language of Trauma
19:25:28 <ehn> twitter
19:26:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> whole thing feels very coached
19:26:37 <ehn> what conor tripler thing
19:26:40 <het> what about conor tripler
19:26:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/cold_currents/status/1501563365004480513
19:26:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> matt linked thisb efore
19:28:08 <ehn> yeah theyre really using all the  right words 
19:30:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> its like extremely hard to respond to something like this with doubt because if you do then you are very much treading the line of being That Guy but like... idk it feels like someone very possibly justifiably had a bad time in a relationship but then is weaponizing Trauma Language to paint the other person as Extremely Evil. i mean he might indeed be evil but. idk
19:31:07 <ehn> ya
19:32:05 <ehn> lol https://twitter.com/cold_currents/status/1501562308236963842
19:32:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
19:32:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> i also think that like uh if youre going to make a public statement you are already at the point of laying your trauma bare where it should probably be incumbent upon you to provide some degree of direct accusation rather than just a laundry list of Terms
19:32:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah
19:33:00 <het> I think that's dumb tbh 
19:33:10 <het> like she doesn't owe you anything?
19:33:33 <ehn> conor chilling with virgilteaxas in heaven now
19:33:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> no she doesn't, see this is what i'm saying, it's hard to talk about this even mildly critically
19:33:45 <het> the audience for that is presumably people who actually know them, not just like people who vaguely recognize the name ConorTripler Internet Funnyman
19:34:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> well i mean she also follows up by making sure that you know who he is online https://twitter.com/cold_currents/status/1501600887654916096
19:34:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> but whatever i'm not trying to mount a fuckin court case
19:35:09 <ehn> she accuses him of over a decade of "horrific abusive patterns"
19:36:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> he was probably shitty and i hope shes ok. im not gonna talk about it anymore w/e
19:37:30 <het> I mean I sort of get what you mean insofar as I think that it nowadays there are examples of people just being flawed people who happen to be shitty romantic partners and it gets framed as something deliberate
19:37:39 <ehn> https://twitter.com/staycjerry/status/1501110922726707201
19:38:10 <het> but from what I see there, I'm disinclined to think that that's all this is?
19:38:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> that's pretty much what i mean. and i think people do somewhat get coached into using this sort of trauma language to frame it that way. i also don't think that it boils down strictly to that either
19:39:03 <het> however I think we can all agree that for all conor tripler's flaws at least he didn't trade for carson fucking wentz
19:39:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> what if you found out that i traded for carson wentz. what then
19:39:36 <het> god, I just don't even know
19:39:38 <het> don't joke about that
19:39:51 <het> well unless you were like the gm of the giants then I'd be okay with it
19:40:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what if it was pete wentz instead
19:41:29 <het> are the commanders starting him at qb? that would definitely be worse
19:44:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they should change the name back

20:01:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive thought about this at least twice a day for the last month or so
20:02:14 <ajj> its really good
20:03:30 <bonegar> shut up ben i'm trying to hear larry do the sonic voice
20:04:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> they should indeed have fired ben right on the spot and replaced him with larry king
20:04:13 <ajj> agreed
20:04:25 <ajj> my latest intrusive thought has been pauly shore doing the pinocchio voice https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ArXSwALDU
20:04:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i love thaty
20:04:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i thought it was a joke the first time i saw it
20:04:56 <bonegar> i had no idea what was going on until someone explaiend it was pauly shore
20:04:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmao
20:05:01 <ajj> same lmfao my friend was like "haha they got pauly shore to be pinocchio" and i was like lol thats a great joke
20:05:07 <ajj> athen like 2 weeks later i went back and watched it
20:05:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> the first joke in that trailer is incredibly bad
20:05:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i didn't realize it was actually pauly shore
20:05:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and then i looked at hte imdb
20:05:51 <bonegar> yea a joke for a 8 year old from 20 years ago
20:06:26 <this_fellow_kermit> finally finished with this stupid ass work
20:06:27 <ajj> it was extra funny cause we just watched some awful pauly shore movie a few weeks ago
20:06:29 <ajj> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xD1ujNkZXs
20:06:35 <ajj> this movie is a yehugeeeee stinker

20:07:18 <this_fellow_kermit> do you think dismember was supposed to be a d-beat style name
20:08:07 <scoop_jackson> thats a classic ajj
20:08:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> describing bio dome as "some awful pauly shore movie" is really funny
20:09:18 <ajj>  Describing Shore's performances in these movies, film critic Roger Ebert wrote "Shore bypasses all categories to achieve a kind of transcendent fingernails-on-the-blackboard effect."
20:09:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
20:09:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we watched pauly shore is dead a few months back
20:11:44 <scoop_jackson> Ajj is 17 shrimp

21:12:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> a tragic life
21:12:20 <Melber> he got gunned down by cops in like a very bougie part of town too lol

21:13:49 <registered_mirc> that writer should get a prize for writing that
21:14:11 <registered_mirc> doing the lord's work
21:14:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> What happened Friday was rare but does have precedence. In west Baltimore in 2002, a loose bull from a slaughterhouse on Pennsylvania Avenue was taken down by a police SWAT team.
21:14:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> In that incident, officials said a SWAT team and crews from the slaughterhouse were able to corner the steer to try to tranquilize it, but SWAT officers ended up shooting and killing it because it charged them after becoming angry at the tranquilizer attempts.
21:14:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> calling the swat team to unload on a cow running around having fun
21:14:42 <registered_mirc> that's People

21:16:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> we are on the top
21:16:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> tbf my brain is also breaking over not being married in my 30s so i feel like it's probably fairly normal
21:16:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> well the bottom is split level i guess
21:16:48 <registered_mirc> so its a big roof leak
21:16:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my friend is also stressing out about it
21:16:48 <registered_mirc> damnm
21:16:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but she's only 25
21:17:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> i guess like
21:17:24 <registered_mirc> well fwiw im 42, unmarried, and it's fine
21:17:27 <registered_mirc> freedom owns
21:17:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> there used to be another skylight on our roof and it was closed up in renovations
21:17:29 <het> yeah I mean I think that's still a relevant point to make
21:18:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> but it was closed up poorly
21:18:20 <het> like yeah, there's a lot of society that can't conceive of people who are over 30 and okay with their lives/not feeling unfulfilled or guilty about not having kids, being married, etc.
21:18:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> hence the leaking i guess
21:18:44 <scoop_jackson> yep het
21:19:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> but we also have a big fucking hole in the ceiling covered by some plastic wrap taped to the ceiling which is loudly filling up with wtaer
21:19:03 <scoop_jackson> outside of certain cultural bubbles id say its the dominant view in america
21:19:12 <Nude_Riker> im bubbled
21:19:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've at least never felt pressure from family to get married or have kids
21:19:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i do nOT want children
21:19:50 <Nude_Riker> the other day someone mentioned "men's obsession with joan of arc" as like a pervasive thing and i felt like i was in another world
21:20:03 <Nude_Riker> not the band, the historical figure
21:20:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> .. what
21:20:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh well it would have made sense if it was the band.
21:20:21 <scoop_jackson> ive never gotten pressured i dont think i could do anything that would make my mom happier than having kids
21:20:22 <Nude_Riker> yeah shrimp1989dspinfo 
21:20:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my mom just refers to my cats as her grandkitties lmao
21:20:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> she Knows
21:20:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> i want to get shot in the face with a missile
21:20:58 <Nude_Riker> if my parents want grandkids they gotta go to my sister, they know this
21:21:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and my dad just pretends i have never been in a relationship or ever will be os we don't talk about that stuff
21:21:01 <het> yeah my mom has never pressured me but I also know she would like grandkids
21:21:10 <Nude_Riker> patriarchy at work baby
21:21:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have no idea if my mom would like grandkids
21:21:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i mean, she probably would
21:21:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> my parents would like grandkids
21:21:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but she loves my cats so it doesn't really matter
21:21:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and she has some cats of her own
21:21:35 <synGuest780> my mom and grandma and everyone on the internet said i shouldnt have kids so now i want some
21:21:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
21:21:50 <Nude_Riker> i think you would be a great father
21:22:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> i would like the leasing company to either send someone over to fix our fucking roof or decapitate me with a sword
21:22:01 <registered_mirc> i feel bad for my mom because she has alienated her grandchildren, my brother's children
21:22:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i didn't even want to get married until kinda recently. my parents just assume i will never get married because i was extremely vocal about not wanting that
21:22:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> preferably as soon as possible
21:22:15 <synGuest780> touch poop for 3 years before you get to the good part where you teach them the real deal about minecraft
21:22:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> one or the other dont really care which at this time
21:22:37 <Nude_Riker> one only need consider your history as a cat dad
21:22:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but like... if you're in a relationship for a really long time why not just get married
21:22:50 <Nude_Riker> yeah
21:22:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> getting married rules
21:22:59 <registered_mirc> you can also just be together and not get married
21:23:01 <Nude_Riker> like, tax benefits vs i guess principles
21:23:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah but i wanna get married because it seems cooler than forever relationship without epic bennies
21:23:40 <Nude_Riker> ya
21:23:53 <registered_mirc> the words of Jeff ring in my head "marriage is a disgusting tool of the patriarchy"
21:23:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/LufYg3nJ/image.png
21:24:00 <Nude_Riker> our society rewards marriage, even though it should not
21:24:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> is that fucking so
21:24:05 <registered_mirc> is that true? i don't know
21:24:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> plus if you're married it becomes much harder to simply leave instead of dealing with problems
21:24:20 <Nude_Riker> marriage is a tool of the patriarchy yes
21:24:24 <dreddybajs> Nude_Riker: it's funny to me that you bust out a "lol patriarchy amirite" after dismissing the reasonable concerns in that tweet lol
21:24:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> matt is simply respecting women on a higher level than you.
21:25:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
21:25:06 <dreddybajs> hmm
21:25:07 <dreddybajs> good point
21:25:18 <registered_mirc> the woman respecter has logged on
21:25:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> marriage is actually cool and epic and seeing it as merely a tool of the patriarchy really downplays its importance to people
21:25:39 <Nude_Riker> i think that the general perception has shifted and being in your 30s without children/marriage is significantly less stigmatized than in 1975
21:25:50 <registered_mirc> shrimp1989dspinfo: that's theorists for you
21:26:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> theorizing is gay
21:26:05 <registered_mirc> indeed
21:26:09 <dreddybajs> well the original tweet did not reference 1975 matt
21:26:11 <dreddybajs> you did
21:26:14 <registered_mirc> lived experience is always ftw
21:26:27 <Nude_Riker> what people believe to be important is a product of the frameworks which define their lives, one of which is patriarchy
21:26:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol
21:26:42 <dreddybajs> "patriarchy is fake when i want it to be actually" - matt
21:26:48 <Nude_Riker> ???
21:26:54 <registered_mirc> this is such a cool convo
21:27:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> no it isnt
21:27:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when women get lesbian married is that patriarchy??? checkmate
21:27:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> because i am not participating in it
21:27:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i am now
21:27:18 <registered_mirc> lol
21:27:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> you ready for it to get cool?
21:27:28 <registered_mirc> i am now
21:27:30 <dreddybajs> hmm... another good point
21:27:31 <alansmithee_> what's the conversation? 
21:27:40 <alansmithee_> i'm down for cool conversation. 
21:27:40 <registered_mirc> alansmithee_: dumb ass politics
21:27:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> consider this:
21:27:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> Women,
21:27:58 <Homie_in_a_geod>                 Be shopping
21:28:02 <registered_mirc> :o
21:28:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ^^^^^^^
21:28:07 <Nude_Riker> women do be shopping
21:28:10 <registered_mirc> i had not considered that
21:28:13 <alansmithee_> Homie_in_a_geod: i see your "women,
21:28:17 <alansmithee_>           be shopping"
21:28:21 <alansmithee_> and raise you a "bitches,
21:28:25 <alansmithee_>                be trippin"
21:28:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ^^^^^
21:28:33 <synGuest780> this has occured
21:28:34 <Nude_Riker> damn can he say that
21:28:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> Fort,           woman
21:28:45 <registered_mirc> sheeeeeeeeeit
21:28:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> can he speak the truth? yes
21:29:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> try women, 
21:29:03 <het> Nude_Riker: I think saying it's significantly less stigmatized than 1975 is a pretty big leap from "not stigmatized"
21:29:14 <Nude_Riker> i didnt say its not stigmatized
21:29:26 <het> I know but you implied that it was so little as to be not worth commenting on
21:29:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wish the band the 1975 would be stigmatized and by stigmatized i mean executed
21:29:32 <het> which Imean, same difference, no?
21:29:37 <registered_mirc> i think we should really split hairs more finely
21:29:40 <registered_mirc> it's an incredible pass time
21:30:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> do you know how fuckin hard it is to split a hair dude
21:30:08 <alansmithee_> registered_mirc: you fight elever of the briar? 
21:30:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> theyre so thin
21:30:13 <Nude_Riker> i was commenting on the fact that in my experience, this is not something that breaks men's brains
21:30:15 <registered_mirc> actually i do tom
21:30:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's pretty easy if you have split ends
21:30:20 <registered_mirc> my hair is fucked up and my ends are split
21:30:22 <registered_mirc> GDI
21:30:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> im more into shitting hairs
21:30:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
21:30:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> beat you to it bitch
21:30:30 <the_tasteful_nerd> because i eat hair
21:30:30 <registered_mirc> beaten by the shrimp
21:30:37 <het> Nude_Riker: I think it does far more than you think
21:31:07 <registered_mirc> my hair isnt that fucked up but i needed a setup for that
21:31:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> materially what exactly does '[x] breaks mens brains' in a tweet even imply.
21:31:17 <registered_mirc> but you just went right in so my setup was also my downfall
21:31:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> >: )
21:31:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't think, i just post
21:31:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> society rewards marriage which is epic
21:31:34 <registered_mirc> true poster's brain
21:31:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> 'a majority of men will be reduced to babbling idiots when confronted with this information'
21:31:52 <registered_mirc> we do be livin in a society doe
21:31:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> it should reward other things too but dont u dare take my epic marriage spoils
21:32:00 <Nude_Riker> that they cannot process it and reject the notion
21:32:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i reject the notion of being unmarried in my 30s

21:41:01 <Nude_Riker> they have to lose that status effect first
21:41:09 <Melber> i wonder how many states still make you take a VD test
21:41:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> now that this is something in the past can i say that it is really funny that [person someone in here used to be married to] one time left the chat in a huff because people were saying that celebrity gossip is stupid
21:41:14 <the_tasteful_nerd> if someone is superdivorced you get to go to like a special support group with kanye

21:47:40 <Nude_Riker> you still can
21:47:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> well i just wanted to link the 2nd post
21:48:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah ajj you can do it
21:48:09 <dreddybajs> lol i clicked on that avoidant article thing and as usual it's a post that says "im a little child that doesnt want to work on my emotional intelligence, please baby me"
21:48:19 <ajj> lol
21:48:20 <ajj>  imean, same
21:48:28 <dreddybajs> lmfao shrimp1989dspinfo 
21:48:44 <Nude_Riker> how do you work on emotional intelligence
21:48:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm dying laughing dude it auto replays in irc
21:48:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
21:48:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ahahaha
21:48:56 <dreddybajs> very carefully matt
21:48:58 <ajj> lmao
21:49:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> dreddybajs: i mean like, i used to be really sympathetic to shit like that but what i didnt realize was that the endpoint of all these things always seems to be 'i don't owe you any self improvement'
21:49:12 <bonegar> i assume it's like when you're eating a meal and a server asks you if you're still working on that
21:49:18 <dreddybajs> yea exactly tom
21:49:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> which i think is a super fuckin toxic thing for a person to suggest that other people do
21:49:33 <ajj> yeah lol
21:49:42 <Nude_Riker> its toxic to suggest i should do anything
21:49:53 <bonegar> 'i'm terrible and i'm furious i'm not being celebrated for it.' - many people who write these things
21:51:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> if that approach 'works' for you (ie you are able to take that approach and live life happily and successfully) then you are either lying and are out here fucking floundering at life and shouldnt be giving anyone advice and should actually be trying to improve instead of digging your fucking heels in, or, your problems probably aren't really that much of a hurdle for you and you shouldnt be advising other people who 
21:51:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> probably have it a lot worse
21:51:49 <het> what's the article we're talking about here
21:52:01 <Nude_Riker> which approach?
21:52:10 <dreddybajs> https://www.self.com/story/avoidant-attachment-style het
21:52:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> 4:49 PM <Homie_in_a_geod> dreddybajs: i mean like, i used to be really sympathetic to shit like that but what i didnt realize was that the endpoint of all these things always seems to be 'i don't owe you any self improvement'
21:52:25 <dreddybajs> Here’s what to know about how avoidants show up—and how to show up for us.
21:52:52 <dreddybajs> remember last year when adhd became the most common self-diagnosed disorder in the world
21:53:03 <dreddybajs> and it gave every dickhead on twitter an excuse to keep being a dickhead
21:53:08 <Nude_Riker> well, it may work for them, their definition of work may be different
21:53:26 <bonegar> i'm simply here to laugh
21:53:32 <Nude_Riker> ive never laughed in my life
21:53:39 <scoop_jackson> im here to do research
21:53:40 <bonegar> you will when im done with you
21:53:43 <ajj> lolo
21:53:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> well that fucking tracks
21:53:46 <Nude_Riker> live love laugh? all no's
21:53:49 <bonegar> lol
21:53:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i laugh all the time even when things are not funny
21:54:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my response is usually just to laugh
21:54:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> generally people laughing comes from situations in which they are experiencing enjoyment of something
21:54:05 <ajj> thats not true matt u laughed at rightgeous gemstones s2 i bet
21:54:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> love to lol
21:54:10 <ajj> ^^^^
21:54:16 <bonegar> i laugh when it's funny, and i wont laugh when it isn't... this pretty much means i'm a terror
21:54:28 <Nude_Riker> laughter is often a response to fear and uncertainty
21:54:30 <mikev> jokerpilled
21:54:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think youve ever seemed particularly uncertain about anything
21:54:55 <dreddybajs> but do you sing when youre winning bonegar
21:55:07 <bonegar> sorry i dunno what you're referencing
21:55:17 <het> dreddybajs: thanks
21:55:32 <dreddybajs> a fantastic album by uk pop legend robbie williams of course...
21:55:48 <ajj> het made a joke once that my favorite rap song was R.A. The Rugged Man - Every Parent's Decision Sucks Dick and i think and lol abt h tat a lot 
21:55:49 <bonegar> <Nude_Riker> laughter is often a response to fear and uncertainty 
21:55:57 <bonegar> applying this logic to 'wait wait don't tell me' listeners
21:56:01 <Nude_Riker> lol
21:56:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> i thought you were referencing the beginning of the song tubthumping by chumbawamba dreddybajs 
21:56:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol bonegar
21:56:16 <bonegar>  <Nude_Riker> lol
21:56:17 <bonegar> got him already
21:56:20 <bonegar> my work here is done
21:56:23 <Nude_Riker> fuck,
21:56:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
21:56:26 <ajj> rofl
21:56:30 -!- bonegar [ghost@skeleton.zone] has joined #phiz
21:56:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> bonegar ftw
21:56:36 <dreddybajs> yeah its named after the chant Homie_in_a_geod 
21:56:48 <het> ajj: hahahha'
21:57:09 <ajj> its a good joke, a great joke even
21:57:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> anyway my therapist sometimes tries to get me to give myself a break about certain things and allow myself to believe that it isnt actually me that is wrong, and it is that the external forces puttign the pressure on me, and like, yes giving myself a break and stop berating myself is a good place to start doing the work from, but sometimes i will be like 'i am extremely frustrated that i have problems with waking up and 
21:57:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> getting to work on time and i am very mad at myself because of it' and my therapists initial response was sort of like 'well why should anyone care when you get to work?' and im like.... because i got hired and its part of my responsibilities man
21:57:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> you are not going to let me fuckin cop out of this one because it's Not Fair
21:58:24 <dreddybajs> yeah that's an odd response
21:58:33 <Nude_Riker> "why should anyone care if you show up on time for a therapy session"
21:58:42 <dreddybajs> i mean we both wish for a better world where work was fun and flexible
21:58:44 <dreddybajs> but thats not the world
21:58:46 <Nude_Riker> ya
21:58:49 <bonegar> a lot of therapy is frighteningly amoral 
21:58:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah
21:59:07 <registered_mirc> https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1501574767614181376?s=21
21:59:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> well he was like 'but in your job it doesnt matter' which is true, it didn't at the time, the rigid hours were totally arbitrary
21:59:27 <Nude_Riker> someone suggested i read some author today i looked them up and they're in the freudian lineage so i dismissed it out of hand
21:59:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> but still, it was part of my job
21:59:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> regardless of whether i liked it or not
21:59:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i had a good therapist who wouldn't baby me and told me when i was being a dumbass and she was ftw but she had neck surgery and ended up quitting her peactice and now i will never go to therapy again
21:59:46 <bonegar> i remember my ex delivering a lot of forgiveness lines to me from their therapist about the terrible things they were doing to me
21:59:59 <bonegar> and it was just kinda like.. that's great, glad you're feeling better.
22:00:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> my therapist tends to baby me a bit but i will fight back when he does
22:00:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> its good to argue with your therapist
22:00:29 <Nude_Riker> maybe you need to be babied a bit
22:00:36 <Nude_Riker> maybe you need to allow yourself to be baby
22:00:39 <alansmithee_> Nude_Riker: what author? 
22:00:44 <bonegar> can't really do anything about that, but i remember the deep frusteration and anger i felt of someone wronging me and saying "I don't deserved to be punished for this." over and over
22:00:51 <Nude_Riker> erich fromm alansmithee_ 
22:00:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah bonegar it feels really awful
22:01:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> im fine thanks
22:01:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> more diapers for you
22:01:07 <alansmithee_> i've heard of him beofre
22:01:09 <registered_mirc> everyone should be punished forever actually
22:01:21 <bonegar> like, just realizing people can do terrible things to you and genuinely be better off for it
22:01:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm great at punishing myself and i do it every day
22:01:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> you have all of eternity for that registered_mirc.

22:04:50 <scoop_jackson> a lot of the frankfurt school marxism draws on freud 
22:04:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> i also cant imagine that theres not a cheaper place that does the same food but better available as an option

22:19:36 <scoop_jackson> it used to make me so mad
22:19:37 <bonegar> i thought it was cool when i was a small child
22:19:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzfwYuYhXmA
22:19:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this is pretty cool
22:19:51 <scoop_jackson> which probably isnt' the right reaction to have
22:19:53 <registered_mirc> like it's a funny artifact that people took seriously and it's given people terminal catigorization brain
22:21:14 <ajj> map of metal ftw
22:21:16 <bonegar> i dont really take any genre thing seriously so it was just liek 'oh cool here is a bunch of music i never heard about'
22:21:31 <ajj> <registered_mirc> dnb subgenres are so silly < i read this as dnd subgenres an dwas trying to figure out wtf you meant
22:21:43 <registered_mirc> lol
22:21:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wait what is ishkur's guide
22:21:55 <registered_mirc> dark fantasy, high fantasy, science fantasy,

22:22:04 <registered_mirc> .g ishkur's guide to electronic music genres
22:22:11 <registered_mirc> god damn it
22:22:12 <bonegar> an old website that tried to map out the history of electronic music
22:22:25 <bonegar> very 'early internet experience' for me at least
22:22:28 <registered_mirc> yeah
22:22:33 <registered_mirc> it was neat in 2000
22:22:44 <synGuest780> i am
22:22:45 <registered_mirc> a charming artifact of the web
22:22:46 <synGuest780> still angry
22:22:47 <bonegar> i do not have the negative reaction a lot of people have about it
22:23:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> seeing the genres i know and like and nodding and sayi ngyeah
22:23:00 <scoop_jackson> im not sure when i first saw it but i already knew enough to think it was nonsensical
22:23:26 <registered_mirc> like imagine engaging with music on this level
22:23:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the rest of this? get out of here
22:23:30 <registered_mirc> with names and categories lol
22:23:44 <registered_mirc> i guess we all do in a broad sense
22:23:49 <synGuest780> he put breakcore under noisecore, and put happy hardcore with breaks under breakcore, hes lucky he didnt get isised
22:23:57 <ajj> rofl
22:24:02 <registered_mirc> but when you start getting into microgenres i start hand waving and ignoring
22:24:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the fiercest battle in music history https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/aH8Rv68R/image.png
22:24:14 <registered_mirc> lol
22:24:14 <synGuest780> you cant even say or mention noisecore it only exists if you're already a weird breakcore guy on soulseek
22:24:19 <synGuest780> which he is NOT
22:24:29 <registered_mirc> lol
22:25:08 <registered_mirc> i love people slapping the word "outsider" on to genres too
22:25:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> breaks = breakcore
22:25:11 <registered_mirc> that's a great modifier
22:25:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> much like kickdrum = gabber
22:25:19 <registered_mirc> outsider gabber
22:25:27 <registered_mirc> outsider jumpstyle
22:25:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> i was just looking at the ishkur site

22:32:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> the leasing company is australian
22:32:19 <synGuest780> do you have laws where apt manager has to live on the same property?
22:32:20 <bonegar> good news, your landlord has insurance to pay for your damages

22:33:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> we have renters' insurance too
22:33:16 <bonegar> there should really be a squatter's rights/commonlaw maarriage thing about renting
22:33:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think anything is actually damaged but we are pretty fucking inconvenienced
22:33:30 <bonegar> like if you rent for long enough you should just get to own the thing you are renting
22:34:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
22:34:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> crazy idea
22:34:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> you should at the very least be able to write off rent on your fucking taxes
22:35:07 <bonegar> yea, it sucks
22:35:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> kind of insane that you can't!
22:35:39 <bonegar> it's almost like most lawmakers are also renters
22:36:20 <Nude_Riker> you mean landlords?

22:53:36 <bonegar> you mean like with you and being irish?
22:53:41 <scoop_jackson> there used to be a record store in bridgeport thats my only interaction with bridgeport

22:55:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> is the mystic aquarium not good?
22:55:46 <bonegar> if anyone tells me they're italian i'll just believe it, no matter what
22:56:21 <scoop_jackson> i just really like the norwalk one, i havent been to the mystic one in 15+ years so i dont remember it too well
22:56:28 <dreddybajs> "bring me pizza" dsp
22:56:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> fast food style
22:57:09 <bonegar> im very suspicious about connecticut in general

23:25:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> i am going to lose my fucking mind
23:25:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> isn't that literally illegal
23:25:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> no
23:25:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> if you can think of a bad thing that a renter can do to a tenant its probably fuckin legal
23:25:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what the hell
23:26:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> yet somehow this is illegal. curious https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/jR7nAZNQ/image.png

23:27:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> i sure like it
23:32:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> we literally can’t even tape this back up because we don’t have a ladder that tall https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/u8WmYmar/1646868746.JPG
23:33:12 <registered_mirc> that sucks dude
23:33:13 <registered_mirc> damn
23:33:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's really cool they didn't even bother trying to temp seal the skylights
23:34:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk i’m not mad at the roofing contractors
23:34:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> i’m just mad at the leasing company for not sending someone over to do a better fix until the new skylight can be ordered or whatever the fuck they’re doing
23:35:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'd be upset about all of it
23:35:15 <ajj> yeah that's really shitty
23:35:34 <ajj> i had a leaky roof in my old apt and they send someone to fix it like, that day 
23:35:42 <registered_mirc> tom maybe you can use a broom stick to push the tape back up
23:35:44 <ajj> cause its generally a Very Bad Thing that needs to be fixed asap 
23:35:45 <registered_mirc> bottom of a swiffer
23:35:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean it’s still leaking so
23:35:57 <bonegar> yea like they can at least put a tarp over it lol
23:36:04 <registered_mirc> not that its any good but it might suck less if you try it
23:36:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> it’s just going to open up again
23:36:20 <registered_mirc> yeah bonegar wtf
23:36:26 <registered_mirc> it's like
23:36:35 <registered_mirc> not a tough problem
23:36:42 <registered_mirc> and they fucked it up
23:36:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> i just don’t really get why they cut everything open if they knew they were going to have to leave it like this
23:37:18 <registered_mirc> yeah that's very bad planning
23:37:29 <registered_mirc> and frankly the guys doing the work should have known that
23:37:37 <registered_mirc> hopefully they aren't milking hours
23:37:44 <registered_mirc> i like to believe people don't do that
23:37:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> i don’t care if they are, the landlord pays for that
23:38:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> if they are then good. fuck em
23:38:16 <registered_mirc> fuck you too apparantly
23:38:31 <registered_mirc> is your bed ok?
23:38:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> it got wet, idk how wet it still is or isn’t
23:39:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> feels dry now actually
23:40:36 <registered_mirc> that's good
23:40:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wonder if i can claim the shit on renters insurance anyway
23:40:50 <registered_mirc> worth a shot probably
23:40:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> we do need a new mattress
23:41:01 <bonegar> go for it
23:41:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> technically i’m also currently in litigation about my mattress lol
23:41:12 <registered_mirc> this is the sort of thing it's for
23:41:17 <bonegar> lol
23:41:24 <bonegar> maybe this was an inside job
23:41:26 <the_tasteful_nerd> worth a shot
23:41:27 <bonegar> *connecting dots*
23:41:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> there’s a class action suit thing because it’s full of fiberglass
23:41:35 <bonegar> definitely some mafia guys caused the leak
23:41:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
23:42:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> absolutely no idea when or if that will ever pay out though
23:42:25 <the_tasteful_nerd> itll be something you get like 10 bucks for in 2030
23:42:54 <bonegar> i remember when i returned to america, my parents told me 'congratulations you were in a class action law suit.' and i got like 80 something dollars...
23:43:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> well technically it isn’t a class action, the lawyers are representing individual clients
23:43:17 <bonegar> so sometimes it happens
23:43:20 <bonegar> oh
23:43:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> so it would be more than a class action if it actually pays out
23:43:30 <bonegar> no idea, too east coast for me
23:43:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> but, who knows
23:45:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> tit
23:53:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> and shit
23:56:10 <registered_mirc> kinda want to make a tomato sauce and then use it for english muffin pizzas
23:56:19 <registered_mirc> then i can get high as fuck and just make those
23:57:22 <ajj> nice
23:57:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
23:57:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> kiddo style
23:58:17 <registered_mirc> that's right
23:58:38 <registered_mirc> i still eat all kinds of stuff i did when i was a kid and it brings me comfort
