00:27:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo>  Egads! Empress Nelda has been captured by the forces of homophobia and is being held deep in a dungeon by an evil lord. Only you and your ragtag collection of gays, drag queens, lesbians and muses can save the empress from the motley crew of evil televangelists, rednecks, neo-Nazis, FBI probes and jocks roaming the dungeon's corridors.
00:27:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Welcome to the world of GayBlade, billed as the world's first computer fantasy role-playing game for gay and lesbian adventurers.

02:04:49 <Disco_Pope> took the trash out and i think my neighbors were fuckin in the living room
02:05:04 <Disco_Pope> sorry for interrupting but i had to wait till i finished making this chicken stock
02:07:10 <HellaBrad> shrimp1989dspinfo wanna adventure around? i'm exploring the horrid swamp zone
02:08:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm gonna go to bed in a bit ):
02:08:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm running around but i'm too tired to really do anything
02:08:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i halfheartedly attempted a couple bosses
02:09:06 <HellaBrad> i gotta remember to ask ppl earlier in the day lol the sun is just starting to go down here
02:10:52 <HellaBrad> any of the bosses giving you trouble? i could help you take one down, end on a high note
02:11:34 <HellaBrad> i have discovered my second awful spike-wheel monster dungeon
02:12:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think i need to respec or something
02:12:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't do enough damage and i keep getting killed in two hits despite being level 60
02:15:18 <HellaBrad> scaling your weapons is really important too
02:15:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> mine is +13
02:16:13 <HellaBrad> you should be doing lots of damage! none of my weapons are that high
02:16:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah idk what the deal is
02:18:04 <dreddybajs> screenshot ur stats page shrimp1989dspinfo

02:23:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/yoVuFYnF/image.png
02:24:31 <HellaBrad> hmmm. yeah aside from trying out some diff ashes of war it looks like your build is fine, i cant think of much to improve
02:24:48 <dreddybajs> yeah build looks good to me
02:25:16 <dreddybajs> shrimp1989dspinfo: remember that "level 60" is only a sum of your stats, and you're kind of a jack-of-all-trades
02:25:23 <dreddybajs> bc youve put stuff into literally every stat
02:26:48 <HellaBrad> yeah i mean with the way your stats are built you're playing in a versatile way, with physical weapons and both kinds of spells, but it prevents you from really maxing out one kind of damage
02:27:01 <NORG> ehn lol 
02:27:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they all seem important
02:27:39 <HellaBrad> yeah that's how i played the previous games and it can get kinda frustrating at higher levels because its some much more work to keep all your stats balanced
02:33:16 <HellaBrad> i think the game definitely punishes you for trying to be able to do everything, at least at early levels
02:35:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i did a minor respec https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/K5QDzBdn/image.png
02:40:27 <HellaBrad> yeah that'll probably help a bit! everything that hits will be a bit stronger that way for sure. If you're still having trouble i would maybe recommend focusing on maybe only int or only faith spells, and putting the extra stats from one of those into your physical stats
02:41:03 <ajj2> it really surprised me how hard you need to pump vigor in this 
02:41:24 <Selfie_Dad> .gis the sex girls
02:41:33 <ajj2> in dark souls 3 you start out with a lot of health and bumping vigor gives you smaller and smaller returns
02:41:33 <ajj2> but in elden ring you start off with crazy low health and you actually get more vigor boost after 20
02:48:07 <dreddybajs> ajj2: yeah i also feel the same is true but opposite about endurance
02:48:26 <dreddybajs> in ds3 you really need to pump stamina, in elden i think even 10-11 endurance is fine for a lot of the game
02:48:36 <ajj2> yeah definitely, i never feel like i run out of endurance
02:49:36 <Selfie_Dad> i always run out of stamina

12:49:16 <antiracist_baby> In Teito Monogatari, Katō reveals his true intentions to destroy Tokyo through any means possible in order to cripple the Japanese Empire. He joins forces with underground Chinese and Korean anti-Japanese oppression groups (such as Donghak Peasant Revolution) and continues to work behind the scenes of various periods of 20th-century history to cause supernatural disasters which will weaken Japan.

14:40:46 <bonegar> it's supposed to get up to 60 today im gonna go for a hike.. i've never seen a fog quite like this though
14:41:16 <bonegar> it's like being in hills or a mountain valley but there's none of that so it's just really high fog
14:41:19 <scoop_jackson> ill enjoy it a lil bit but im gonna be in the office most of the day
14:42:01 <bonegar> i guess we're literally in economic warfare right now
14:43:36 <Selfie_Dad> tall fog = it's fall, dog
14:44:13 <bonegar> genuinely never quite seen anything like it, it's a freezing fog too. i think i should go out in it, but it'll probably burn away in the next hour
14:44:34 <bonegar> reminds me a lot of forest fire smoke

15:24:48 <eric> The restrictions just ended on Friday
15:25:18 <eric> The news sucks
15:25:27 <eric> I just sneezed 3 times
15:26:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Selfie_Dad yabbies ftw
15:26:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> baltimore aquarium has many shrimp friends
15:26:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have great teeth! no cavities!
15:26:44 <Selfie_Dad> i saw a few people wearing masks at the st patricks day parade on sunday
15:26:45 <Selfie_Dad> lol
15:26:53 <Selfie_Dad> maybe they know i something i dont
15:28:42 <eric> Yeah it makes sense in USA where masks have been illegal for months
15:29:10 <Nude_Riker> our mask mandate only lifted beginning of thi month
15:30:26 <dreddybajs> i th ink theyre still required on public transport here but thats it maybe
15:32:39 <eric> I think they are "recommended" on transit now
15:33:13 <dreddybajs> oh i guess same here now
15:35:26 <scoop_jackson> i have no idea what the rules are
15:37:57 <dreddybajs> .tag nic doesnt know the rules
15:38:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> federal laws state that masks are required on public transit
15:39:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> maybe medical offices as well? i'm not sure if that was left up to the states or if it was a federal rule
15:39:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hasn't ended yet
15:39:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i think most other restrictions have been lifted
15:40:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the only times i've ever had to actually pay attention to mask rules were for hockey games
15:40:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> .y mask off
15:41:06 <Selfie_Dad> .y mask in
15:41:14 <eric> Not that I care about if people wear masks or not it's just weird to see the newspapers clutching pearls over people wearing masks when like 3 weeks ago they gleefully reported on unusual economic sanctions against covid protestors
15:41:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> 🤔
15:42:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah it's really infuriating to see the insane wiplash
15:42:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so i just don't pay attention

16:06:40 <the`shima> i wish there was another fallout game like new vegas tbh
16:06:42 <Selfie_Dad> this week
16:06:50 <Nude_Riker> well, new vegas 2 is supposedly planned
16:06:53 <Nude_Riker> but it will suck
16:07:03 <ajj2> new vegas ftmfw
16:07:17 <the`shima> probably the only game in that engine ive enjoyed
16:07:34 <Selfie_Dad> there will never be another good video game
16:07:37 <Nude_Riker> what else was even on gamebryo
16:08:06 <Nude_Riker> oh right oblivion, but i hate TES
16:08:12 <Nude_Riker> and morrowind
16:08:32 <Selfie_Dad> morrowind was a different engine
16:08:39 <the`shima> oblivion is the ony one i enjoyed and i think its cause id never played anything like that. i enjoyed the running around and stuff
16:08:43 <Selfie_Dad> also a much better game than oblivion
16:08:48 <Nude_Riker> oh sid meir's pirates was on gamebryo???
16:08:50 <the`shima> dark brotherhood quests. thats about it
16:08:53 <the`shima> skyrim ftl
16:09:07 <Nude_Riker> idk Selfie_Dad im looking at the wiki page for gamebryo and it lists morrowind
16:09:27 <Selfie_Dad> i mean its like a completely new version at least
16:09:38 <Nude_Riker> netimmerse was the old engine that became gamebryo yeah
16:09:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> Epic Mickey
16:09:41 <Selfie_Dad> so i dont know that its really comparable
16:10:01 <Nude_Riker> i love the 3d sid meir's pirates so thats two games on that engine i like
16:10:07 <Selfie_Dad> .l
16:10:08 <the`shima> i guess i meant the skyrim/fallout shit in general
16:10:10 <Nude_Riker> insane to think its the same engine
16:10:19 <the`shima> fallout 3 ftl. fallout 4 ftl. tes ftl
16:10:29 <Selfie_Dad> i never played those games
16:10:42 <Nude_Riker> agreed the`shima 
16:10:44 <eric> They're all bad but I'll still play en
16:10:56 <Nude_Riker> lol epic mickey was on gamebryo
16:11:00 <Selfie_Dad> morrowind was good
16:11:05 <Selfie_Dad> esp at the time
16:11:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> summoning ftw
16:11:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> .y summoning land of the dead
16:11:22 <Selfie_Dad> playing it now it's got some obvious jank though
16:11:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> 12:07 PM <the`shima> probably the only game in that engine ive enjoyed
16:11:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> 12:07 PM <Selfie_Dad> there will never be another good video game
16:11:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oops i only meant to copy the second one
16:11:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but
16:11:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> haunted chocolatier is coming out in 4 years
16:11:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> then there will be another good video game
16:11:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> platform masters is coming out                        someday

16:38:42 <scoop_jackson> please upvote some of the positive reviews of my friends book to help displace the negative reviews at the top https://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Country-A-Memoir/dp/0385548028
16:38:56 <scoop_jackson> (you dont have to do this but i gotta say i tried)
16:39:12 <Nude_Riker> lol
16:39:29 <Nude_Riker> i dont appear to have the ability to vote on reviews
16:39:35 <bonegar> i'd have to read the book first
16:39:40 <bonegar> ...should i read your friends book?
16:39:50 <scoop_jackson> its a fast read
16:40:15 <scoop_jackson> i enjoyd it, its not something i would have read otherwise because i would classify it as like literary non fiction
16:40:21 <bonegar> yeah
16:40:36 <Nude_Riker> 'literary non fiction' oof
16:40:41 <bonegar> lol
16:40:48 <scoop_jackson> how is that an oof???
16:40:57 <Rusty> Qian Julie Wang is intelligent and educated, how could she write such a negative dark book ? Very disappointed. 
16:41:02 <bonegar> in my mind i was thinking 'well that's all nonfiction but i'm not gonna make this a thing, bonegar-style'
16:41:06 <ajj2> lol
16:41:26 <Nude_Riker> scoop_jackson, it sounds like the worst type of writing i can imagine
16:41:26 <scoop_jackson> lol she got real mad at the reading in my hometowns local book club for old ladies
16:41:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> scoop_jackson: because matt is too smart for your friend's book
16:41:33 <ajj2> ^^^
16:41:36 <ajj2> its funny to me it shows a bunch of grumpy USA reviewers and then all the non-USA reviewers are glowing
16:41:39 <scoop_jackson> cuz they were rascist
16:41:42 <ajj2> it shocks u, to see what lies beneth
16:41:43 <bonegar> lmao, what is up with these reviews though
16:41:44 <bonegar> actually
16:41:45 <Nude_Riker> nothing to do with the book i know nothing about, just the phrase "literary non fiction"
16:41:51 <bonegar> are these all her friends giving bad reviews? seems insane
16:42:02 <Rusty> sounds like somebody doesn't like to consider the lobster
16:42:09 <Nude_Riker> .g literary non fiction
16:42:25 <bonegar> me: ah yes, non fiction.
16:42:30 <Rusty> what about clitorary non fiction. cuz i can't find it!!
16:42:35 <ajj2> rofl
16:42:35 <dreddybajs> uh have you heard of for example truman capote Nude_Riker 
16:42:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> beneath him.
16:42:54 <Nude_Riker> hm, well i do enjoy dfw's essays but thats not what that phrase brings to mind
16:43:05 <scoop_jackson> ?!
16:43:15 <bonegar> i think he was wrong about the lobster thing
16:43:41 <bonegar> anyway, why is your friend getting so many bad reviews
16:43:49 <ajj2> scoop_jackson im sincerely sorry your friend has to deal with the loads of ppl going well MY family came from czechoslovakia with $600 in our pocket and we did fine so maybe u should learn to LOVE this great country 
16:43:51 <Nude_Riker> im not talking about any actual literary category just those words together create a very bad image in my mind
16:43:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> has a man ever been injured by having a lobster clamp its claw on his ding dong
16:44:05 <bonegar> did they get plugged by some website or something.. that seems like a lot of people to be angry about your book
16:44:06 <dreddybajs> holy fuck Malenia is difficult
16:44:16 <Rusty> book is checked out with a hold queue at my libraries
16:44:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> greatest first lady we ever had actually dreddybajs.
16:44:26 <Nude_Riker> well no such thing as bad press right
16:44:26 <scoop_jackson> tbh the book is pretty posi on america
16:44:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> show some respect.
16:44:31 <dreddybajs> lol
16:44:34 <ajj2> rofl
16:44:40 <scoop_jackson> maybe a lil too much for me
16:44:41 <bonegar> do you not know why?
16:44:52 <scoop_jackson> and i love america
16:44:56 <scoop_jackson> my favorite holiday is july 4
16:45:07 <bonegar> it seems weird to get review bombed like that
16:45:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> only like 3% of overall reviews for the book are negative, its just weird that the negative comments are listed as top comments
16:45:27 <bonegar> yea
16:45:33 <Nude_Riker> high engagement
16:45:35 <Nude_Riker> weird
16:45:35 <Selfie_Dad> Homie_in_a_geod> has a man ever been injured by having a lobster clamp its claw on his ding dong
16:45:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> i guess that you could mark positive comments as 'helpful'
16:45:40 <Selfie_Dad> almost certainly
16:45:41 <dreddybajs> lmao i just shouted WHAT THE FUCK 
16:45:43 <dreddybajs> at this boss
16:45:45 <bonegar> but also he asked due to the negative reviews so i was curious about the story of the negative reviews
16:46:11 <bonegar> america and 4th of july ftw actually
16:46:22 <scoop_jackson> yeah the helpful reviews go to the top if i understand correctly
16:46:24 <Selfie_Dad> .l

16:46:41 <Selfie_Dad> [duke deuce voice] W cieniu Golgoty
16:46:45 <scoop_jackson> Homie_in_a_geod: my friend contends a conspiracy but probably some paranoia 
16:46:50 <bonegar> is it like a vengeful mom going in there and upboating the bad reviews
16:47:20 <Nude_Riker> i assume everything that happens on amazon is the result of poorly constructed bots
16:47:49 <Nude_Riker> trying to suppress rankings of books in a similar category to a target book or something
16:47:53 <bonegar> yea the review system is almost entirely useless
16:48:24 <bonegar> but i definitely would feel bad to get negative-review botted
16:48:25 <scoop_jackson> could be Nude_Riker but could also just be that the characteristics of ppl that press the review helpful button is different from those that write reviews
16:48:34 <Nude_Riker> yeah
16:48:52 <Nude_Riker> "saved me money!"
16:49:12 <bonegar> i cant imagine reading reviews of books on amazons as a way to judge wanting to read a book
16:49:14 <Selfie_Dad> Pooplunch stands in solidarity with the Black community.
16:49:24 <Nude_Riker> people are very strange bonegar 
16:49:42 <scoop_jackson> i read reviews because the books i care about arent on the bots radar
16:49:48 <Selfie_Dad> i think the review system is useful sometimes 
16:49:51 <Selfie_Dad> but probably not for books
16:50:00 <scoop_jackson> creating a botnet to downvote walter karp reviews
16:50:01 <bonegar> you also read a specific kind of book
16:50:14 <bonegar> i can see that being more useful for non-fiction
16:51:01 <scoop_jackson> mccaine hasn't written an amazon review since 2013 :(
16:51:10 <eric> Reading reviews is usually more useful than looking at the breakdown 
16:51:26 <mandarin_toni> reading reviews is more useful than reading books
16:51:44 <eric> Especially on steam
16:51:49 <eric> That's true too
16:52:14 <bonegar> yeah, but i dont think you'd really want to read at all if you want utility
16:52:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> scoop_jackson: it seems that the book is popular and she was on the today show or w/e and when that happens oyure going to get a lot of middle america morons
16:52:15 <eric> Especially for me the slow reader 
16:53:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> .gis dick thrower
16:53:15 <ajj2> https://noisypixel.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Stranger-of-Paradise-Final-Fantasy-Origin-1-800x445.jpg.webp lmao
16:53:28 <bonegar> people who watch the today show are like the people who reply to the POTUS twitter account
16:53:39 <ajj2> i NEED to get the Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin trucker hat 
16:53:46 <bonegar> so the today show thing makes all the sense
16:53:47 <scoop_jackson> yeah she had a good publisher so it was on the best selling list the week it came out
16:53:54 <bonegar> ok there's the answer lol

16:56:28 <dreddybajs> she was very lethargic yesterday
16:56:29 <scoop_jackson> another funny story about the book is that she recorded the audiobook version herself and the audiobook director kept asking her to mispronounce chinese words so that the intonation matched the english intonation for the sentiment of the word
16:56:50 <eric> Lol
16:57:13 <eric> That just wouldn't sound like anything to a Chinese speaker then probably

17:23:18 <Selfie_Dad> check out the french dispatch

17:23:25 <eric> ;D
17:23:35 <scoop_jackson> my mom had a poem accepted to the paris review then the editor changed and they scrapped the issue :(
17:23:39 <eric> ive heard of that i guess ill give it a shot
17:23:42 <eric> that sux
17:23:44 <dreddybajs> damn 
17:23:47 <dreddybajs> thats still very cool
17:23:49 <eric> its cool that your mom is a poet thought
17:24:06 <bonegar> eric did you ever read jesuit joe?
17:24:14 <eric> ive never

17:24:25 <bonegar> .gis jesuit joe 
17:24:28 <mandarin_toni> .g smart french magazine
17:24:53 <bonegar> i read jesuit joe in french because it was slightly easier than italian
17:24:59 <eric> interesting
17:25:05 <Selfie_Dad> h
17:25:11 <eric> i willr ead it it looks cool
17:25:26 <eric> i understand graphic novels are a thing in france
17:25:29 <Selfie_Dad> humming "jesuit joe" to the tune of runaway sue
17:25:30 <mandarin_toni> read asterix
17:25:49 <dreddybajs> i was doing it to the tune of polythene pam Selfie_Dad 
17:25:52 <bonegar> euro guy ideas of canada, it rules
17:25:54 <mandarin_toni> no one will ever be truly euro until theyve read the first 20 asterixs
17:25:59 <dreddybajs> asterix ftw
17:26:01 <eric> ive read several of them
17:26:02 <the`shima> god my head is fried at work atm lol
17:26:05 <eric> as a boy
17:26:22 <the`shima> im jumping between 4 projects that all have really complex data models that pull from multiple source/do merging/transformations/etc
17:26:35 <scoop_jackson> i would have gotten more asterix as a kid but it wasnt always easy
17:26:46 <eric> i think i read them at the dentist
17:26:49 <the`shima> its hurting my brain a bit now to problem solve on one then jump into something totally different
17:26:52 <Selfie_Dad> i wonder if i can recycle this old christmas tree we have
17:26:54 <scoop_jackson> the library only had them in french
17:26:54 <Selfie_Dad> probably not
17:26:56 <mandarin_toni> i was translating a 15min infomercial for an elliptical today
17:27:08 <eric> bring it to the beach and burn it will
17:27:13 <Selfie_Dad> its fake
17:27:16 <Selfie_Dad> that'd be worse
17:27:18 <eric> that sounds mind numbing
17:27:19 <mandarin_toni> burn the fakes
17:27:56 <eric> is there a beach where the kids go and have fires and drink beer there will
17:28:06 <eric> or is that just all beaches
17:28:18 <Nude_Riker> asterix ftw
17:29:46 <Selfie_Dad> no u cant do a fire on the beach w;o a permit
17:29:58 <Selfie_Dad> maybe on the private beaches they do
17:30:02 <Selfie_Dad> but there arent a lot of those
17:30:09 <bonegar> depends on the state i guess
17:30:18 <eric> you cant do that here either but some beaches you can and youd be pretty unlucky to get in trouble
17:30:50 <bonegar> in SF they had huge fire pits on their public beach, but i think they were permanently locked down due to red flag warnings
17:30:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> .gis bbrbrbrbebrberbebraberhbaehrbah
17:32:11 <Selfie_Dad> the public beaches are patrolled fairly frequently
17:32:41 <eric> too bnad
17:33:05 <eric> during the summer here they have guys on quads zoom up and down solely just to ruin peoples days if they have a brewski cracked
17:33:31 <eric> but in evening on the beaches where the quads cant go
17:33:51 <bonegar> in evening... on the beaches... where the quads can't go... 
17:33:57 <Selfie_Dad> yeah they have those on some beaches 2
17:34:06 <bonegar> *wistful sigh*
17:34:07 <Selfie_Dad> u can get away w/ brewski if ur not being a dumbass about it
17:34:13 <Selfie_Dad> but a fire is not happenin

17:46:38 <mandarin_toni> i havent drank a beer outdoors this year yet
17:46:42 <mandarin_toni> the time is approaching
17:48:42 <scoop_jackson> yesterday was the first time i was in a bar since before the pandemic i think
17:48:53 <eric> wow
17:49:21 <eric> friday was the first time i went to a show since march 2020
17:49:33 <eric> covid is over, for ever this time
17:51:28 <bonegar> covid is over
17:52:02 <bonegar> cannot wait for camping season
17:52:32 <Nude_Riker> considering drinking beer tonight as well, "why not?"
17:54:17 <mandarin_toni> i have been to bars throughout the pandemic
17:54:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ^
17:54:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> after the first three months or so i just did whatever
17:54:56 <eric> ive been to a lot of restaurants
17:55:13 <eric> there arent really very many bars here
17:55:15 <eric> that arent clubs
17:55:22 <scoop_jackson> i dont really go to bars often yeah
17:55:27 <mandarin_toni> weird city
17:55:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i went to watch playoffs
17:55:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and to hang out a couple times
17:55:42 <eric> its because of provincial liquor regulations toni
17:56:00 <mandarin_toni> we destroyed the competition at the pub quiz yesterday
17:56:03 <eric> you need a special licence to serve liquor without food and its really restrictive and stupid
17:56:24 <dreddybajs> you get any good ones mar
17:56:28 <dreddybajs> mandarin_toni *
17:56:45 <mandarin_toni> icr
17:56:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my teeth still feel gritty from being polished even though i rinsed my mouth and had lunch
18:01:05 <Nude_Riker> well i wouldnt go to a bar tonight probably
18:01:06 <Selfie_Dad> same here eric
18:01:23 <Selfie_Dad> theres like maybe 3 places near me tht are Just Bars
18:01:28 <Selfie_Dad> and theyre grandfathered in
18:02:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there are many bars here
18:02:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there are tiny bars in some of the liquor stores around here
18:02:45 <eric> one of the things about the liquor primary licences here too is that for a bar playing music minors must have assigned seating to be allowed in
18:03:09 <eric> so if your a small diy venue its basically impossible to have a show with youngsters and people drinking
18:03:21 <Selfie_Dad> yeah
18:03:22 <Selfie_Dad> that sucks
18:03:34 <Nude_Riker> there are many bars here but i do not enjoy going to bar alone
18:03:43 <eric> then dont
18:03:54 <Selfie_Dad> i think the only way you get away w/ just serving alcohol here is if you're a winery/brewery/distillery tap/tasting room
18:04:09 <Selfie_Dad> i like going to bar alone sometimes
18:04:17 <Selfie_Dad> just being in the middle of some shit

18:04:43 <eric> yeah i like it too
18:04:54 <eric> i used to go to the pub myself after work sometimes and just read in the sun
18:06:49 <Selfie_Dad> yeah esp being home all the time it would just help me feel like I Live In A Society
18:08:07 <bonegar> i was thinking about going to see the batman movie in the theater just because i can but idk 
18:08:13 <eric> one time when i was in paris we stopped at a cafe for a drink and there was this girl sitting there drinking beer and chain smoking
18:08:23 <eric> and she probably smoked half a pack while we were sitting there
18:08:47 <eric> thats a vibe and i can kind of feel it 
18:08:53 <bonegar> the alamo by me is open so i can just like.. walk there and see a movie if i wanted to
18:09:02 <bonegar> but im still not really used to doing stuff
18:09:14 <eric> the best way to get used to doing stuff is to do it
18:09:27 <bonegar> yeah but i gotta ask if i want to get used to it again or not
18:09:31 <scoop_jackson> last movie i saw alone was sin city 
18:09:36 <eric> its a good time for self reflection
18:09:47 <eric> i dont think ive ever seen a movie alone
18:09:49 <eric> at a theatre
18:09:52 <bonegar> seeing movies alone is fun 
18:09:54 <scoop_jackson> im having trouble remembering what the last movie ive seen is 
18:09:58 <scoop_jackson> (in the theatres)

18:13:33 <mandarin_toni> the 60s hungarian film i saw was pretty cool
18:14:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the last one i saw was scream 5
18:14:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it was bad
18:15:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i guess technically it was just called "scream"

18:19:06 <antiracist_baby> i realized if i want to get a japanese visa i will have to come clean with my employer about not actually having a degree at some point
18:19:17 <eric> lol
18:19:27 <Selfie_Dad> lol
18:19:30 <antiracist_baby> its distinctly possible that nobody who would be responsible for signing off on it even realizes i claimed i had one
18:19:30 <eric> do u think that would actually be a rpobelm
18:19:35 <eric> yeah
18:19:39 <antiracist_baby> i kind of suspect not
18:19:44 <antiracist_baby> but its scary to consider
18:19:50 <Selfie_Dad> i mean you could continue to lie i guess
18:19:50 <eric> its just a interview filter more than anything im guessing
18:20:00 <Selfie_Dad> they might not even bother to contact the hypothetical uni
18:20:21 <antiracist_baby> you need to provide evidence of ur educational background in your visa application
18:20:35 <Selfie_Dad> do you have to send them like a transcript i guess
18:20:45 <antiracist_baby> yeah you send it to your employer and they send it to the visa people
18:21:02 <eric> i doubt its an actual requirement for the visa 
18:21:09 <eric> to have the degree i mean
18:21:12 <antiracist_baby> its not
18:21:15 <eric> its just to verify that you are truthful
18:21:18 <antiracist_baby> yea
18:21:39 <antiracist_baby> thats why it would only be a problem w/ my employer
18:21:58 <Selfie_Dad> .g how to forge a university transcript
18:22:08 <Nude_Riker> lol
18:22:19 <eric> i wouldnt fuck around with that frankly
18:22:35 <eric> id much rather just own up to the company 
18:23:39 <scoop_jackson> what about the guy you are sucking up to 
18:23:52 <scoop_jackson> if you work for him can u just not have the degree on your resume
18:24:25 <eric> wasnt there some thing about how one of the people who interviewed you also went to leeds
18:24:28 <eric> or whatever it was
18:26:00 <eric> i think i would just put nothing in there and if there were any questions come back just be honest and say that you learned japanese on your own and felt the university requirement was arbitrary
18:26:10 <mandarin_toni> are you looking for a workign visa to japan or whats the deal
18:26:12 <eric> i think since you are good at your job they will just be like whatever
18:26:18 <scoop_jackson> yeah
18:27:39 <Selfie_Dad> yeah if you've established yourself as one of the better translators on the team i doubt they'll give a shit
18:27:44 <bonegar> pass a jlpt instead
18:27:46 <antiracist_baby> i kind of suspect it will not come up
18:27:49 <antiracist_baby> lol
18:28:01 <bonegar> if you really want a credential
18:28:02 <dreddybajs> the only reason i could think it would be a problem is if you're on a diff salary bc of it or something
18:28:05 <antiracist_baby> i need to go to japan to get the listening experience to be able to pass the jlpt i think
18:28:08 <Selfie_Dad> and possibly be more impressed that you're an autodidact ?
18:28:18 <bonegar> you dont, but it's a good reason to go
18:28:46 <antiracist_baby> that is the main reason i want to go
18:28:56 <antiracist_baby> not to pass the jltp just to get better in general

19:18:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> hell yeah i do bitch
19:19:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> fuck you and fuck running
19:19:24 -!- dude_as_hell [~cgiirc@synIRC-385A46B9.res.spectrum.com] has joined #phiz
19:20:18 <bonegar> it'd make more sense to leave it instead of staying one hour ahead
19:20:40 <bonegar> but like all wars, i guess im glad its over and we'll never have to hear about this ever again
19:21:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> the night people have won and i cannot be happier
19:21:13 <bonegar> wouldn't might people want it to be dark more?
19:21:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> no.
19:21:26 <Selfie_Dad> no.
19:21:26 <bonegar> then...
19:21:30 <bonegar> oh
19:21:31 <bonegar> weird
19:21:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> i will not be taking questions at this time
19:21:43 <Selfie_Dad> yes i love when for months on end its pitch black by 5pm
19:21:44 <bonegar> i just want it to be dark most of the time
19:21:53 <Selfie_Dad> go in your room w/ blackout curtains
19:22:16 <scoop_jackson> i mean i drive to work when its totally dark in the winter anyways
19:22:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> i also saw people complaining about the emotional toll this will take on their children when they have to go to school and its dark in the morning
19:22:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> maybe make school later
19:22:33 <bonegar> yea i guess i dont really have a dog in this fight
19:22:34 <Selfie_Dad> that happens all the fucking time, Now
19:22:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> also fuck your kids.
19:22:41 <scoop_jackson> hmm i see there is a josh barro / bonegar axis on this issue
19:22:49 <Selfie_Dad> it is dark most times kids go to school
19:23:04 <scoop_jackson> could this be the future of politics? milquetoast centrism + bonegar thought?
19:23:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol this owns https://twitter.com/AdequateEmily/status/1503672681018843138
19:23:09 <Selfie_Dad> it is not dark in like the summer months
19:23:21 <bonegar> well i don't think we should do the time change
19:23:32 <bonegar> so my issue is already solved.. i just would have gone the other way about it
19:23:40 <scoop_jackson> how do you feel about honeydew
19:24:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> WREG.com
19:24:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> Young Dolph autopsy released, ruled homicide
19:24:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> 5 hours ago
19:24:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> damn you think?
19:24:11 <scoop_jackson> lol
19:24:38 <Selfie_Dad> lmao tom
19:24:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> [man is shot 22 times] lets wait until we have all the facts before we call this a "murder"
19:24:47 <Selfie_Dad> the times already changed
19:25:11 <bonegar> breaking
19:25:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> someone is shouting along to michael jackson pyt very out of tune outside
19:25:24 <Selfie_Dad> i think they should have changed the time so it is 30 minutes inbetween standard time and daylight savings time
19:25:28 <Selfie_Dad> then everyone would be happy.
19:25:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think they should call it a "time pass"
19:25:46 <Selfie_Dad> so right now it would be 3:00 instead of 3:30. this would work
19:25:51 <bonegar> now we're talkin
19:25:54 <scoop_jackson> you are right will
19:26:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZMSZ5DMCSY
19:26:24 <bonegar> time zones should probably be like every 2 miles
19:26:31 <bonegar> 5 miles maybe
19:27:02 <scoop_jackson> it should be a continous adjustment
19:27:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> according to macrofactor im like almost double my calorie limit today
19:27:08 <bonegar> ideally yes
19:27:09 <scoop_jackson> now that we have gps all over the place
19:27:11 <bonegar> localized to the individual
19:27:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> dont. give. a. shit.
19:27:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> all of my drinks were after midnight tho so thats why
19:27:33 <Selfie_Dad> lol yeah 
19:27:56 <scoop_jackson> lol
19:28:55 <eric> yes
19:28:59 <eric> continuous metric time baby
19:29:40 <bonegar> Real :clap emoji: structural :clap emoji: change
19:29:48 <Selfie_Dad> even if you double ur limit one day you're still in a pretty good deficit
19:30:05 <Selfie_Dad> over the week
19:30:06 <Selfie_Dad> assuming ur daily limit is a ~500 cal deficit per day
19:31:26 <eric> it was cool when the french just came up with a whole new calendar for a while
19:32:01 <eric> i like it when nations take big swings on things that arent war or whatever
19:32:02 <bonegar> yea their republican calendar or whatever and it was based off all these things
19:32:16 <bonegar> so cool, france is cool for being like that about things in general
19:33:35 <bonegar> though i guess you could kinda say they were in a war when doing that
19:44:29 <ehn> Metric time ftw too

20:26:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've taken him out on a leash before but i haven't lately because of my freak neighbors
20:26:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they're gone today though!!!

22:09:31 <ajj2> he just has sooo much health

22:10:05 <ajj2> i gotta grab dinner but thats epic
22:10:09 <ajj2> i feel better knowing its not just me suffering
22:14:09 <mikev> omg an el penis post just for me
22:14:12 <mikev> I'll be driving through eastern Missouri in the next few days and I'm looking for a cheap and safe hotel around the halfway point of my trip, someplace where my car (hopefully!) won't get broken into at night. I am not looking for, and nor am I expecting, anything fun to do while I'm there; I just need a place to get out of my car after a ~8-hour drive, crash for a night, and then leave. Also I'm on a budget and don't want to 
22:14:12 <mikev> spend too much if I can avoid it.
22:14:12 <mikev> I am specifically AVOIDING St. Louis because I assume the traffic will be a nightmare and this trip is already gonna be a big enough pain as it is, but would any of y'all happen to know anything about *checks notes*...... Caruthersville or Portageville? Or would I be better off staying somewhere a little further nortth of the Bootheal?
22:14:23 <cashflow_cody> seems like theres no other samurai gear you just start lookin like a slubberdegullion
22:15:01 <cashflow_cody> a weasel turd
22:19:04 <HellaBrad> is there a way to save "outfits" like in sekiro?
22:19:23 <mikev> $135 a night is too rich for el penis' blood
22:19:46 <HellaBrad> i wanna equip light load for the first phase med load for the second but i cant change clothes that fast in a boss fight :S
22:27:30 <cashflow_cody> kenshi is better than elden ring btw, cause you can just have like 40 dogs and a farm and sit on your tower all day waiting to snipe cannibals with a harpoon
22:28:28 <HellaBrad> oh man finally another cultured kenshi enjoyer
22:28:49 <HellaBrad> long have i wandered this desert
22:29:02 <cashflow_cody> im uhh i forgot my name but i might be the same dude
22:29:16 <HellaBrad> ehn
22:29:33 <HellaBrad> lol
22:30:25 <cashflow_cody> elden ring is just grody zelda which is fine, but kenshi is way deeper in the "why the fuck would you make this?" genre
22:30:44 <HellaBrad> its very ambitious
22:30:59 <HellaBrad> its like dwarf fortress wasteland
22:39:01 <eric> that sounds cool
22:39:26 <dreddybajs> thats andrey brad
22:39:27 <eric> changed my mind
22:39:40 <bonegar> ive had a lot of people rec kenshi to me
22:39:41 <dreddybajs> ajj2: i thought he was ok but its annoying getting 1 shotted at hte start of the fight lol
22:39:54 <ajj2> the camera does Not like large boys
22:40:00 <alansmithee_> kenshi has some cool ideas but idk if the gameplay is any good
22:40:16 <eric> open world crafting games are sone gen z shit
22:41:38 <HellaBrad> the gameplay isnt really there right now, learning to play it is like learning to fly small aircraft
22:42:52 <HellaBrad> but its very cool as a game concept, yeah. i like to train my little post apocalyptic friends with spears and dream of the game that might be if we ever figure out how to defend our rusty little compound from hordes of raiders
22:43:55 <cashflow_cody> the gameplay is there it just has to click after you realize that some cool shit happened, like you tried to steal some booze and got your arms and legs chopped off, good luck leveling up, goku
22:44:26 <bonegar> i was watching some videos on it a long time ago, and some guy was trying to build a base on some kind of plateau that was really hard to get to, and a lot of it was trying to get the building placements to fit on the map area
22:44:28 <HellaBrad> but then at the same time you can send out little raiding groups of heroes to other towns and places on quests, and click back and forth between them on the map... its almost like a genuine world-sized real-time rpg
22:44:50 <bonegar> but building base in weird spot is right up my alley
22:45:13 <dreddybajs> i had so much fun doing that in Rust with my friends years ago
22:45:14 <HellaBrad> i loved when i figured out how to build underground in rust
22:45:22 <dreddybajs> building weird little bases hanging off cliffs and stuff
22:45:31 <dreddybajs> that sucked ass strategically but looked funny
22:45:36 <cashflow_cody> i got settled nicely by a surprisingly calm coast and the only problem was huge hordes of cannibals that came and killed everybody several times, that's literally the most chill place in the game to settle not even kidding
22:45:37 <bonegar> i watched a ton of rust base building vids, those were cool
22:45:39 <eric> that sounds cool but i dont want to chop down trees
22:45:42 <bonegar> shame about the actual game part tho
