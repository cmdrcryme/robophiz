13:52:18 <bonegar> do you think it's the weather's fault or something else
13:52:26 <bonegar> i have this weather angle right now on feeling bad i'm really latching onto
13:52:46 <Nude_Riker> i have no idea but i dont think its weather related since this has been going on for a few weeks in various ways
13:53:26 <bonegar> oh yea your sinus thing
13:53:37 <Nude_Riker> yeah
13:54:03 <Nude_Riker> im giving the clean the humidifier and run it thing another try today but last time that somehow made me feel worse
13:56:47 <bonegar> do you really need a humidifier
13:56:58 <bonegar> it seems like that would genuinely make your sinuses worse
13:57:00 <Nude_Riker> in the winter yes i do
13:57:14 <Rusty> this winter has been hell without one, for me. i keep putting it off
13:57:32 <bonegar> ive never used one and i dont understand them
13:57:51 <registered_mirc> you might not be sensitive to super dry hot air

14:09:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> wow didn't forsee #phiz season 14 ending with everyone getting long covid and becoming a bumbling moron
14:09:17 <registered_mirc> lol
14:09:28 <registered_mirc> thats my secret cap, i was always a bumbling moron
14:09:56 <bonegar> https://i.imgur.com/RWrv45V.png this is getting crazy
14:10:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> getting paid for gaming ftw
14:10:36 <bonegar> long covid isn't real, it's a sex thing. and yes, i'm sighing
14:10:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah its wacky out there
14:10:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> are you playing elden ring or vampy survivors
14:10:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> long covid is just anxiety and depression
14:10:54 <bonegar> getting paid for gameing is stressful and feels bad
14:11:01 <the_tasteful_nerd> gonna be like 44 degrees tomorrow and like 77 on sunday
14:11:10 <bonegar> yea this is too extreme
14:11:13 <bonegar> cant it just be winter forever
14:11:29 <the_tasteful_nerd> fuck no
14:11:32 <the_tasteful_nerd> fuck winter
14:11:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/pM6HjRXk/image.png
14:11:43 <the_tasteful_nerd> but, i wouldnt mind it actually being spring for a couple weeks
14:11:45 <registered_mirc> im playing elden ring shrimp
14:11:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm gonna ride my bike on sunday
14:11:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> before it becomes Full Summer
14:11:55 <bonegar> yeah
14:11:58 <registered_mirc> probably not gonna play vampy survivors for a while
14:12:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but new update...
14:12:06 <bonegar> i have a deep dread of summer, if we're dealing with 70s in march
14:12:15 <registered_mirc> my mind is too small for two games
14:12:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah i dont wanna plunge headlong into 85-95 degree days
14:12:23 <scoop_jackson> i love summer
14:12:24 <Nude_Riker> im pretty sure long term health problems resulting from covid are real, in some cases
14:12:33 <registered_mirc> i loathe summer 
14:12:36 <bonegar> i gotta keep my cheevos topped off, but i also am starting to feel kinda done w/ the game
14:12:41 <registered_mirc> spring and fall are the best
14:12:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> give me like 2 weeks to have days where It's Pleasant To Be Outside
14:12:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> spring and fall ftw
14:12:54 <scoop_jackson> im just gonna wait for a few months till theres more content in vs
14:12:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah spring and fall are best, too bad they barely exist anymore
14:13:01 <bonegar> in some cases many things are 'real'
14:13:01 <the_tasteful_nerd> not here anyway
14:13:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> summer fail unless i'm going swimming or tubing or w/e
14:13:12 <bonegar> but i think it's largely a sex thing
14:13:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what do you mean
14:13:24 <registered_mirc> bonegar are you having an existential crisis
14:13:40 <bonegar> uh... i dunno what you mean
14:13:45 <bonegar> i think maybe im just like this sorry
14:13:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there is more content, there is a new level and a new boss and a new character and a new weapon (:
14:13:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> summer is good
14:14:43 <bonegar> .g existential crisis meaning
14:15:02 <bonegar> oh i dont believe in any of that stuff, no crisis for me.
14:15:19 <registered_mirc> 'grats
14:15:49 <bonegar> i think i mostly just feel a little sad i dont understand humidifiers
14:15:55 <registered_mirc> i definitely thought i was going to get long covid in the hospital
14:16:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/YSdcflNQ/image.png
14:16:17 <registered_mirc> and the doctor was like, yeah lots of people thing that because of doom scrolling and looking up their own symptoms
14:16:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah
14:16:23 <bonegar> dairy planet
14:16:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> long covid is literally just people being anxious/depressed about being sick
14:16:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> smoking  big doinks in amish
14:16:54 <the_tasteful_nerd> Despite the creation of case definitions, there are no widely accepted clinical diagnostic criteria for "long COVID" [13]. However, as of October 1, 2021, there is a new International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10) for unspecified post-COVID conditions, which is U09.9, which was approved by the CDC.
14:16:56 <bonegar> psychosomatism is real
14:16:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and being locked inside for 2 years
14:17:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> "locked inside"
14:17:02 <bonegar> psychic energy is real
14:17:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> self-isolating is what i mean
14:17:23 <registered_mirc> yeah it is. i get assaulted by other people's psychic enegry constantly
14:17:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> instead of going outside and seeing their homies and generally doing things that are healthy 
14:17:34 <registered_mirc> because they are clueless as to how to weild it
14:17:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/clipart1994bot/status/1499311387595710465?s=21
14:18:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> im willing to entertain "long covid" as persistent nagging symptoms in people who were hospitalized with severe disease
14:18:14 <the_tasteful_nerd> and less so in those with mild forms
14:18:21 <registered_mirc> i think that is highly likely that being stressed and anxious about covid makes it more difficult on your immune system
14:18:25 <registered_mirc> cortisol and whatever
14:18:35 <bonegar> shrimp, i'd occasionally cook w/ one of my friends.. but now they want to go back to restaurant eating and i'm like.. extremely bummed out about it
14:18:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that sucks
14:18:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> cooking with someone else is really fun
14:18:48 <bonegar> ya
14:19:13 <bonegar> but they just fall back to 'it's work' mentality and grumble.. but the last two restaurants we went out to were terrible
14:19:19 <bonegar> i mean it was fine but just like
14:19:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> restaurant eating is cool too
14:19:44 <registered_mirc> they're both good
14:19:49 <bonegar> absolutely not worth it, post covid prices, and post covid quality 
14:19:56 <the_tasteful_nerd> there's no real evidence supporting a mechanism for long covid, just anecdotal and survey studies of reported symptoms
14:19:58 <registered_mirc> sometimes i want to pay someone who is a better cook than i am to cook for me
14:19:59 <bonegar> yah it's good if the food is good
14:20:34 <bonegar> yea i'd say these places were not better cooks than me, and not in a way that i'd brag, just really bad quality
14:20:42 <the_tasteful_nerd> i think if your baseline health was poor prior to contracting the disease it makes sense to me that your recovery would be lagging behind
14:20:43 <bonegar> due to all sorts of understandable reasons
14:21:01 <the_tasteful_nerd> but im not ready to accept long covid as something that persists beyond like 3 months and isnt psychosomatic
14:21:05 <registered_mirc> yeha if its not better than your own work thats kinda wack
14:21:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> and/or poor baseline health to begin with
14:21:30 <bonegar> a virus is a pretty abstract concept i guess, and so it's very easy to get lost in a maze of various beliefs
14:21:36 <Nude_Riker> long covid is a description for a wide range of things, getting covid can absolutely give you long term respiratory problems and stuff
14:21:39 <bonegar> as we've seen over the last two years
14:21:44 <registered_mirc> one of the things i was happy about was the doctor himself being like, we don't actually understand covid
14:21:54 <registered_mirc> breath of fresh air
14:22:06 <Nude_Riker> "long covid" as a discrete thing doesnt exist, sure
14:22:27 <registered_mirc> the thing the docs were mostly worried about were people getting pneumonia and dying from covid that way
14:22:28 <the_tasteful_nerd> yes but those aren't unique to covid
14:22:29 <nine`eleven> Telll you what, I'd never listened to The Beatles with much attention and after that weird cover I found I thought I'd listen to the original of Let It Be since people are always like "Listen to that it's amazing." It's fucking shit though
14:22:30 <the_tasteful_nerd> as an illness
14:22:50 <bonegar> lol
14:23:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
14:23:23 <registered_mirc> the beatles are mostly famous for popularizing a pop music formula that we still use today
14:23:26 <bonegar> i'd guess the 'covid lowers your IQ' thing is maybe true if you just did not get oxygen to your brain for a long time
14:23:28 <registered_mirc> which they stole 
14:23:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> milk monster https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/AIlwq9RR/image.png
14:23:51 <nine`eleven> it's just a boring song
14:24:00 <registered_mirc> like most beatles songs
14:24:00 <bonegar> im glad the beatles are mostly over
14:24:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my iq was already low as hell so when i got the plague i was immune to becoming dumber
14:24:07 <registered_mirc> lol
14:24:13 <bonegar> they're fine but i'm glad we've moved on as a culture
14:24:33 <Nude_Riker> this workshop coordinator for this training is so much a Presenter and not a technical expert
14:24:40 <nine`eleven> https://youtu.be/mGrQTRcxdTo
14:24:41 <Nude_Riker> "ohhh my polls"
14:24:42 <bonegar> getting your IQ into the negatives to become a super genius
14:24:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao holy shit
14:24:46 <nine`eleven> Here's a cool song
14:24:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the dairy plant is insane
14:24:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you can get a map but these awful enemies immediately surround you and kill ou
14:25:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah bonegar that's my goal
14:25:55 <nine`eleven> Remember that song Paul McCartney did for Destiny 2
14:26:01 <scoop_jackson> the best beatle related thing that intersects with music i care about is that yoko ono song larry levan remixed 
14:26:10 <bonegar> yes
14:26:23 <bonegar> he appears in the video as a hologram it rules

15:44:06 <pubeman77> oopsie
15:51:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> 5 just 5
15:51:24 <Melber> so many ties in hockey
15:53:13 <pubeman77> those aren't ties
15:53:20 <pubeman77> those are overtime losses 
15:53:34 <pubeman77> they did away with ties in the :newnhl:
15:53:58 <Melber> why
15:55:26 <pubeman77> because they thought shootouts would be more exciting
15:56:12 <greatest_gamer> het: one of my clients is a small law firm that does casework for walmart and just signed a cybersecurity form, without review, that has requirements they‚Äôre going to bleed trying to meet and also has requirements that apply to us as the IT provider. they sent it to me after the fact to review for compliance‚Ä¶
15:56:18 <greatest_gamer> what i‚Äôm saying here is i blame you.
15:56:21 <NORG> How is everyone doing :)
15:56:30 <Melber> lmao greatest_gamer 
15:56:43 <Melber> lawyers are so fucking terrible at cybersecurity
15:56:49 <greatest_gamer> ayup
15:57:02 <greatest_gamer> they are so actively bad at it they make it worse than if they did nothing
15:57:04 <bonegar> it's not the job of a lawyer to be good at cybersecurity
15:57:20 <greatest_gamer> bonegar i won‚Äôt go into a whole professional thing here but that is incorrect
15:57:27 <bonegar> just like it's not the job for a lawyr to understand the truth
15:58:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> scrog
15:59:48 <Melber> "the truth" seems like an awfully definite idea
16:00:23 <bonegar> heh heh heh
16:02:26 <Melber> bonegar: i mean what im actually saying, and what i actually believe, is that any attempt to get to "the truth" about something is going to fail spectacularly, so it's not really worth making a goal
16:02:54 <bonegar> hail satan
16:04:46 <registered_mirc> ultimate truth of the universe maaaan
16:04:59 <registered_mirc> [rips bong]
16:05:02 <het> greatest_gamer: lol sorry :)
16:05:40 <greatest_gamer> u can‚Äôt know the truth cause it changes when u observe it
16:05:41 <greatest_gamer> look it up
16:06:11 <bonegar> laws have NEVER had to justify a divine providence 
16:06:29 <Melber> what is that supposed to even mean
16:06:31 <greatest_gamer> lol het this is blowing my mind like to be clear this form requires both my client and us as NCG to align with NIST301 or ISO 27001 and have both internal audits and approved third-party audits available on-demand from walmart
16:06:53 <greatest_gamer> this law firm is like 12 people
16:06:56 <registered_mirc> just thinking about The DMT Lawyer and every argument he makes in court is in relation to The Universe
16:07:02 <bonegar> i mean i think you'd have to get really high to believe in laws, just like you'd have to get really high to believe in truth or aliens
16:07:22 <greatest_gamer> they‚Äôre going to go bankrupt just trying to align with a security framework and pay for the auditing lmfao this rocks
16:07:49 <bonegar> lmao
16:07:53 <bonegar> the DMT lawyer
16:08:21 <registered_mirc> i've consulted with my staff of machine elves to do some groundwork on the case
16:09:20 <Melber> im not sure what "believing in" has to do with anything but aliens there, which is the only thing with the possibility of being corporeal
16:09:30 <bonegar> your honor, i would like to call to the stand "The shadow man who stands over you while you sleep at night"
16:10:20 <Melber> the other two things are just... concepts.

16:17:20 <Melber> when i was in canada rabbits were all over the place and would just come up to you and let you pet them
16:17:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> simply lol if u don't have a special mental connection with a style of animal
16:17:34 <bonegar> two creatures observing eachother is a powerful mental connection
16:18:30 <bonegar> however the person trying to microwave a burrito, it not heating up and throwing it out and trying a new burrito... that's a scientist

17:17:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> eric how is sara's grandma

17:17:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's good
17:18:03 <Melber> the_tasteful_nerd: i think they keep making them
17:18:04 <eric> shes got a ct scan either yesterday afternoon or today morning but ill find out when we go today
17:18:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i hope all is well
17:18:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yesterday ciaran and mpg tried beating godrick with me but we died like 20 times
17:18:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and gave up
17:19:01 <Melber> oh he was only the producer for the first one
17:19:26 <eric> sounds fun anyway
17:19:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah it was funny
17:19:41 <eric> i keep forgetting to put the password in ill do that today if i play
17:20:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you should hop on voice sometime when we're all playing
17:20:26 <eric> i would like to its just been bad timing lately
17:20:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah no worries
17:20:39 <eric> im a little shy too hee hee ;-)
17:20:46 <alansmithee_> what does square up do? 
17:21:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's fine it's just me constantly making stupid sounds at the game and we're all talking about our own games too
17:22:51 <ajj2> godrick sucks so much rofl
17:22:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i hate ihm
17:23:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i also almost killed him on my own
17:23:09 <registered_mirc> hes a fucker
17:23:11 <ajj2> niceee
17:23:12 <registered_mirc> you can do it
17:23:16 <ajj2> his second phase is brutal
17:23:20 <registered_mirc> you only have to do it once
17:23:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and between the three of us we only got him down to half health which was really funny
17:23:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah first phase is iz
17:23:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ez*
17:23:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm about to fight the dragon
17:23:34 <ajj2> bosses' health scale with summons too
17:24:12 <ajj2> have you been using the npc summon for godrick ? that helped me a lot 
17:24:21 <eric> watching my friend fight a boss he is much better at timing dodges and such so he would get guys down slowly and then have bad luck and die 
17:24:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah
17:24:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i suck ass at battles i just hang back and throw fireballs
17:24:42 <eric> vs me who rushes up and does a lot of damage but then also gets bad luck and die
17:24:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm gonna fight the dragon so i can get dragon fireball
17:24:54 <ajj2> im also a fireball Chuckster
17:24:56 <eric> sounds cool
17:25:18 <ajj2> pure melee builds seem insanely hard in this one honestly 
17:25:33 <eric> it seems the same to me as other from stuff
17:25:41 <eric> but idk
17:25:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> buck
17:25:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> my bed is out for delivery
17:25:55 <ajj2> the bosses feel a lot faster, like sekiro / bloodborne speed compared w dark souls
17:25:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the dragon keeps oneshotting me with fire
17:26:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this is NOT epic
17:26:11 <ajj2> fuuu
17:26:21 <ajj2> do you have the miracle that helps you resist fire
17:26:35 <ajj2> you should be able to cast it if you can cast fireball
17:26:41 <lavender_toni> there are wholegran wheat, tofu, bokchoy and yellowfoot mushrooms in my stir fry
17:26:48 <eric> soudns good
17:26:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i do not

17:41:36 <Rusty> https://www.swedishsongs.de/smf/index.php?board=1.0 found a max martin/cheiron forum lol
17:42:56 <eric> first question i already want to select multiple
17:43:16 <dreddybajs> oh hell yeah https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/pBOxZWVM/image.png
17:43:53 <scoop_jackson> Result: You are Michel Foucault!
17:45:21 <scoop_jackson> i hope bonegar does it and gets karl popper

17:46:09 <eric> the last question is good
17:46:36 <eric> oh i guess the second to last
17:47:18 <eric> Result: You are J√ºrgen Habermas!
17:47:31 <dreddybajs> mission accomplished https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/M9q2PsVd/image.png

17:47:58 <scoop_jackson> hm wouldnt have pegged you for a habermas guy eric but i guess it kinda makes sense
17:48:04 <alansmithee_> i've never heard of that guy before

17:51:40 <dreddybajs> excellent tom
17:51:50 <registered_mirc> first half of that sentence was weird het lol
17:51:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> i need to figure out how to print out a nicer copy of this because our printer is a piece of shit
17:52:00 <registered_mirc> i was like, het's trying to get into bar culture wtf?
17:52:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i still printed one and glued it to a day/night token
17:52:51 <eric> re habermas i agree with this you recognize that the primary activity of human beings is to interpret the meaning of things in the world around them. As human beings themselves, researchers also interpret meanings and cannot therefore keep their own perspective separate from their research
17:53:15 <eric> i would say this is not really my thing as much Since there is no absolute truth, research must instead use reason and argument to arrive at the best interpretation. 
17:53:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't know anything about thinking so this fun internet quiz is beyond me
17:53:27 <eric> not much for reason or argument
17:53:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> speaking of things that i agree with noz had a good grumpy tweet last night
17:53:51 <registered_mirc> shrimp1989dspinfo: fwiw neuroscience doesnt know much about thinking either
17:53:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/noz/status/1499255773850857473
17:54:13 <registered_mirc> seems right
17:54:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think it was probably before then but yeah
17:54:22 <registered_mirc> it annoying
17:54:26 <eric> i dont agree with calling them hipsters 1.0
17:54:32 <eric> them/me
17:54:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Result: You are Karl Popper!

17:54:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> idk what this means
17:55:00 <lavender_toni> ive read saussure but i think the philosophical position ascribed to him are more like extrapolations of the text rather than something laid out in it so i dont really have much of an idea about structuralism
17:55:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> karl poppers would be a good name for a gay edm dj or something
17:55:45 <eric> structuralism is a modernist plot
17:56:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> anyway yeah it bothers me that no one cares about liking obscure music anymore. i learned so much about music and got into all of the coolest stuff i ever found out about because of my internalized struggle vs all the other cool people to like the weirdest shit
17:57:01 <lavender_toni> Result: You are J√ºrgen Habermas!
17:57:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm going to listen to 90s radio alt rock an dhave fun
17:57:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> death of filesharing culture is responsible for that i think
17:57:14 <registered_mirc> apparantly its more fun to be elitist about behavior than listening to cool music
17:57:24 <registered_mirc> or, righteous is a better word
17:57:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> [tune of einsturzende neubauten - halbermensch] habermas
17:57:39 <Rusty> lol
17:57:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> i meant to have the space correctly in there in halber mensch
17:58:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have a million jungle tapes i can listen to that porbably 5 other people have ever listened to OR i can think about how someone mentioned lit yesterday and listen to lit
17:58:26 <bonegar> if everyone cared about obscure music it would it be obscure? *pondering*
17:58:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> who really cares
17:58:33 <bonegar> *falls into a toilet and dies*
17:58:36 <registered_mirc> what tapes shrimp
17:58:37 <registered_mirc> i care
17:58:49 <Rusty> it's cool to find your own identity, and if crate digging (digital or otherwise) helps that's fine
17:58:49 <eric> i get what u r saying tho
17:59:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they're all recordings of parties
17:59:12 <lavender_toni> i was extremely obscurity driven but then i settled into a situation where i mostly care about music i go see live and the element of competition kind of recedes there when youre limited by whats on offer in a mid size city
17:59:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> some of them have mcs whose vocals are like way louder than the music and i hate them
17:59:23 <eric> i think one of the coolest hings about olden times is you would just go to yonder inn and listen to some guy flail about on a lute and that would have been the best tune youve ever heard
17:59:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> jungle mumbling
17:59:28 <lavender_toni> i dont know anuthing about habermas
17:59:30 <lavender_toni> sounds like some plogo shit
17:59:36 <registered_mirc> yeah im not a fan of jungle mcs
17:59:40 <registered_mirc> even mc conrad, who is good
17:59:43 <scoop_jackson> lol
17:59:43 <eric> now everyone in the world listens to one famous armonium player and nobody cares about the lute guy anymore
17:59:46 <registered_mirc> he needs to pipe down
17:59:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like to do funny garage mc voices
17:59:50 <bonegar> lol
17:59:56 <scoop_jackson> my undergrad thesis talked about habermas a little bit
17:59:58 <bonegar> remember when sting tried to become the lute guy
17:59:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but they're not constnatly going like jungle mcs
18:00:04 <scoop_jackson> not a habermas guy anymore tho!
18:00:09 <lavender_toni> tantric lute guy
18:00:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> sitting in silence and yelling BASSLINE real dramatically and continuing on
18:00:18 <registered_mirc> ;p;
18:00:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> wheres this quiz
18:00:19 <registered_mirc> lol
18:00:21 <dreddybajs> there is still quite a lively culture in irish trad of passing songs down in families, singing at home, and amateur sessions at the pub eric
18:00:25 <dreddybajs> it's lovely to experience when i can
18:00:31 <bonegar> i think if you like things for yourself and not for other people it's easy to avoid most of these probs
18:00:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> jungle mcs are good when theyre just dancehall mcs on jungle tracks
18:00:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> like on that congo natty record
18:00:40 <lavender_toni> as the most irish person here i can confirm
18:00:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> idk sometimes that's annoying when it's just a recording of a party
18:00:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> every tape i have from 94-97 has an mc
18:00:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> who won't shut up
18:00:58 <the_tasteful_nerd> its good imo
18:01:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the recordings are NOT good so it's not fun
18:01:10 <Rusty> when do you spell it MC vs 'emcee' i wonder
18:01:12 <registered_mirc> if you care about jungle without mcs shrimp1989dspinfo there is goldenerajungle.com
18:01:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/he8UHRcN/image.png
18:01:15 <registered_mirc> and it kicks ass
18:01:15 <scoop_jackson> yeah i agree shrimp
18:01:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> goatse cloud
18:01:20 <bonegar> .g when is st patrick's day and also is st patrick a real saint also what are saints again anyway thx
18:01:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> why cant i answer 'goatse cloud' to this question
18:01:24 <registered_mirc> mostly dj tapes
18:01:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> when ur being lazy vs when ur being pretentious 
18:01:30 <scoop_jackson> i like jungle mcs at jungle shows but i rarely like them on the tapes
18:01:30 <Nude_Riker> is this from a forum "anyway yeah it bothers me that no one cares about liking obscure music anymore. i learned so much about music and got into all of the coolest stuff i ever found out about because of my internalized struggle vs all the other cool people to like the weirdest shit"
18:01:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> its called paddys day
18:01:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh yeah mph i have a lot of stuff like this that i just pulled from slsk
18:01:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> mpg*
18:01:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> fuck off matt
18:02:00 <Nude_Riker> "no one" meaning your peer group who have aged and settled into tastes?
18:02:19 <eric> i think thats cool ciaran
18:02:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> allow me to reiterate the previous thing that i said; fuck off matt
18:02:50 <bonegar> he has a sinus infection
18:03:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> who does
18:03:05 <bonegar> matt
18:03:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh is that why he's an ass hole
18:03:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol mpg i'm clicking through and i have so many of these already
18:03:12 <ehn> nooo
18:03:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> interesting
18:03:14 <bonegar> i dunno
18:03:19 <bonegar> i just really wanted to bring that up
18:03:22 <bonegar> i felt it was important
18:03:24 <ehn> feel better matthew
18:03:36 <registered_mirc> shrimp1989dspinfo: theres a dj snuggles tape that i particularly like
18:03:45 <registered_mirc> it encapsulates my favorite stuff about that era in general
18:03:47 <Nude_Riker> thanks ehn i hope the doctor tomorrow can tell me whats going on and how to stop it
18:03:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> which one
18:04:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'll listen to it next time i'm in the car or maybe on sunday when i go on a bike ride
18:04:07 <registered_mirc> snuggles jungle book a and b
18:04:18 <eric> the snuggle book
18:04:25 <Nude_Riker> jungle? more like yumgle, because i enjoy it
18:04:36 <bonegar> i think people occasionally post pretty good stuff in the what are you listening to thread
18:04:37 <bonegar> sometimes not
18:04:42 <bonegar> but there is a lot of 'obscure' there
18:04:46 <eric> i find that too
18:05:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> .yt lit my own worst enemy
18:05:01 <registered_mirc> tom had one of the best obscure music threads in phiz history
18:05:05 <registered_mirc> with the chinese punk rock thread
18:05:05 <bonegar> lol
18:05:08 <Nude_Riker> lol
18:05:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> if you enjoy the jungle so much perhaps you should try being devoured by an anaconda
18:05:13 <eric> in general its all good but i dont taste some of it
18:05:19 <the_tasteful_nerd> i have defeated stonedigger troll
18:05:24 <registered_mirc> nice
18:05:34 <eric> well done
18:05:45 <scoop_jackson> bonegar can you please do the epistomology quiz? consider it a personal favor. you can even answer randomly so long as you dont tell me you did. 
18:06:02 <Nude_Riker> someone just referred to firefox as mozilla which i havent heard in a while
18:06:05 <Nude_Riker> in this training
18:06:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> .yt shy fx balaclava

18:06:41 <bonegar> jungle classix
18:06:44 <registered_mirc> lol this dog bark
18:06:46 <Nude_Riker> i was really surprised that album was good
18:06:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this came out during high plague and i hate that i didn't get to go dancing and hear this irl
18:06:54 <bonegar> Ever wondered how well you might get along with Francis Bacon if you were having dinner together? Ever thought, "Wow, Jane Addams was AMAZING; I'd like to help people like that"? Take this quiz to figure out how you approach doing research and learn cool new fancy-schmancy terminology to use at your next academic dinner party.
18:06:56 <bonegar> no
18:07:01 <bonegar> i have never wondered that
18:07:04 <eric> i pray for netscape to rise from the ashes and offer a good browser to the world
18:07:05 <scoop_jackson> i think its cool that some of the stuff that i like that was once obscure is now somewhat obscure
18:07:09 <bonegar> and just because you wordered it that way doesnt mean i will now
18:07:11 <bonegar> i know your trick
18:07:14 <registered_mirc> .y photek minotaur
18:07:17 <registered_mirc> ^^^^
18:07:33 <eric> time to go
18:07:35 <Nude_Riker> i cant imagine going somewhere that would be playing shy fx, here
18:07:39 <Nude_Riker> it would be sick tho
18:07:46 <bonegar> lmao these answers are too limiting and frusterating all ready
18:07:57 <eric> agreed 
18:08:02 <registered_mirc> all the parties here are drum and bass and completely full of feckless bros
18:08:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think very rarely i can find things in nyc
18:08:06 <bonegar> i see what you're doing quiz
18:08:21 <registered_mirc> drum and bass rather than like 'jungle' specifically
18:08:28 <registered_mirc> liquid bullshit
18:08:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> my bed has arrived
18:08:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> ftw
18:08:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i missed seeing ikonika and sctatcha dva a few years ago and i'm still mad at myself over hat
18:08:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> everyones favorite place to dance around here had a fire upstairs and got ruined by water damage a few months ago
18:08:50 <scoop_jackson> did you ever go to konkrete jungle shrimp?
18:08:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what was it
18:08:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> and will probably not be open again until like next year at the earliest
18:08:54 <lavender_toni> martin
18:08:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no
18:08:55 <lavender_toni> dude
18:09:04 <bonegar> reason and senses are trigger words so are hypotheses
18:09:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> bossa nova civic club
18:09:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> also yeah photek ftw
18:09:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh that place burned down? lmao
18:09:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> i liked bossa nova but i hadnt been there for a couple years
18:09:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> well no it didnt burn down the fire was in an apartment upstairs
18:09:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> think last time i went there uhhh... skream was playing and i wa son drugs and hated it so bad i immediately left
18:09:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> it got fucked with water damage
18:09:42 <scoop_jackson> bossa was good but a little too techno for me
18:09:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that show sucked os much ass
18:09:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he was playing like bro house
18:09:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol that seems like a weird vibe for bossa
18:09:56 <Nude_Riker> https://twitter.com/GoodPostReilly/status/1499366279840514056
18:09:58 <scoop_jackson> or like dont know how to describe it but adjascent to what i really like rather than what i really like
18:10:09 <registered_mirc> bro house
18:10:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> rip tandem
18:10:13 <registered_mirc> nightmare zone
18:10:15 <Nude_Riker> that sounds about like what i would expect skream to play now lol
18:10:23 <bonegar> my research space is filled with.... 'my computer' 
18:10:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i was having a great time on my drugs and the second i walked in and heard the music i got extremely upset
18:10:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think the big place where everyone goes to dance now is nowadays which is very close to my apartment
18:10:40 <Nude_Riker> :(
18:10:40 <registered_mirc> i have never thought skream was very good
18:10:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and asa soon as i left my mood went right back up
18:10:45 <registered_mirc> even when dubstep was good
18:10:48 <scoop_jackson> i guess i havent been to bossa since the year it opened 
18:10:53 <scoop_jackson> so i probably should talk to about it
18:11:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> bros let's go dancing
18:11:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> the best dj things i ever went to were at cameo and 285 kent which are both very much gone now

18:11:47 <lavender_toni> i saw skream like a month or two before next hype came officially out and he played it and i spent the next day failing to find thgat amazong song called "neck tie"
18:11:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> i saw dj rashad at 285 kent with dan heed and neil and i was on a lot of drugs and ended up being there until like 6 in the morning, well after they left

18:12:12 <the_tasteful_nerd> dj spinn ftw
18:12:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think addison groove was also on that bill but maybe that was a different thing
18:12:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> dj spinn ftw
18:12:28 <registered_mirc> dj spinn still sounds like the future
18:12:29 <scoop_jackson> i wanted to go to body and soul on mlk day but canceled cuz of the rona ;/
18:12:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i saw dj earl once and i was extremely drunk and talking to him and there's a really funny picture where he looks normal and i'm very clearly out of my gourd
18:12:44 <Nude_Riker> i want to see if i am also the prison man
18:12:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
18:12:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> a guy at that show pulled a knife on me ftw
18:12:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> dj earl ftw
18:12:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it was extremely dramatic and funny

18:13:19 <Nude_Riker> wow these are really annoyingly phrased immediately
18:13:23 <bonegar> yea lol
18:13:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he was asome absolutely trashed german guy threatening me and my friend because we wouldn't go home with him ??
18:13:32 <Nude_Riker> damn
18:13:33 <registered_mirc> wow!
18:13:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
18:13:45 <lavender_toni> germany shouldnntve been allowed to rearm
18:13:50 <registered_mirc> lol
18:13:59 <registered_mirc> they're armed with techno now
18:14:01 <scoop_jackson> i think that means matt is also gonna get foucault 
18:14:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> never trust a european in new york
18:14:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and even though he was being raelly aggro i thought it was just funny because i was drunk and he was a nonthreatening lanklet
18:14:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> first time ive seen this one https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/F9KoeuCr/1646331267.JPG
18:14:42 <lavender_toni> im gonna go read an extremely dry and boring german book about the history of the baltic sea
18:14:43 <the_tasteful_nerd> Wood Dust? come on
18:14:44 <bonegar> ive never seen an angry german guy, just dorky german guys who like to talk about engineering and math and stuff
18:14:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Wood Dust
18:14:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he told me he'd been shot and showed me a scar but it was clearly just a mole removal scar
18:15:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i laughed in his face
18:15:25 <registered_mirc> lolll
18:15:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> i got on the wrong end of an angry french guy once who did not threaten violence at me but did try to sexually assault 2 people i was with and stole their money
18:15:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've had bad experiences going dancing, i got literally actually kidnapped once and i didn't go out for a long time after that
18:15:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> that was one of the more insane nights i have had
18:15:49 <registered_mirc> what the fuck
18:15:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like a guy just shoved me in a car and would not let me go for many hours
18:15:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> jesus christ
18:15:56 <registered_mirc> jesus
18:16:01 <Rusty> eek
18:16:14 <Nude_Riker> yeah i ended up with foucault as well
18:16:17 <bonegar> trying to imagine a german guy being angry and it's very funny, i'd start asking them about the intricacies of deutsche telekom or something
18:16:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
18:16:31 <bonegar> eventually ramping up to ask "do you have computers in your country?"
18:16:36 <Nude_Riker> lol
18:16:39 <bonegar> the best part is they'll answer sincerely
18:16:41 <bonegar> and it rules
18:16:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> the angry french guy story is one of my more complicated stories
18:16:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> again i was drunk so i didn't really see it as an issue until i wsa sobering up and then i realized like oh shit he's actually not stopping eve nthough i keep asking him to stop and let me out
18:16:48 <greatest_gamer> trying to imagine a german guy being angry in 1936
18:16:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> i cant imagine that greatest_gamer 
18:17:04 <bonegar> nobody could
18:17:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> i can imagine an austrian guy being angry at around that time though
18:17:07 <greatest_gamer> ya i‚Äôm coming up empty
18:17:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he was talking about how it was fate we met and imaginary friends and his library card
18:17:11 <bonegar> that's why it was so easy for them to invade
18:17:16 <greatest_gamer> oh you motherfucker
18:17:18 <greatest_gamer> ohhhhh
18:17:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> >:)
18:17:27 <scoop_jackson> jfc shrimp
18:17:41 <greatest_gamer> this is a devastating turn of events
18:17:41 <bonegar> yikes lmao
18:17:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> good grief that sucks
18:18:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> im going to tell my french guy story because i want to see how well i remember all of it
18:18:10 <bonegar> german guy trying to explain his imaginary friends to you is very funny
18:18:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh this wsa a different guy
18:18:20 <bonegar> oh
18:18:48 <Nude_Riker> https://twitter.com/magicmeows/status/1499091518732193792
18:19:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i didn't go out for several years and then my first show again was kode9 and lee gamble
18:19:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> kode9 ftw
18:19:19 <registered_mirc> Nude_Riker: yeah that is very funny
18:19:23 <bonegar> ja this is mien eingebildeter mensch his name is Hans and he is very good at driving the speedlimit on the autobahn, this is our little joke
18:19:26 <scoop_jackson> i went to an outside thing last summer but i havent done any other music things since pre pandemic
18:19:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> my story goes like this: carsick cars and pk14 were touring on the east coast in 2009 which was extremely exciting to me because they were from china and i was very into them, and they played a few shows in new york and then went some other places and then came back to new york
18:24:37 -!- robophiz [~robophiz@B8C50673.F3C7BB78.33CA7D1E.IP] has joined #phiz
18:24:48 <Nude_Riker> hahaha
18:24:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> i somehow completely lost the guys i was with and ended up in this group of people from boston; the guy was with the girls but was heavily on xanax and basically mute as a result of it
18:25:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> so the french guy drops us off at his place after everyone gives him cash and he goes to a pay phone to make a phone call and we're all milling around and i am trying to figure out like, who exactly these people even are because i have become their sherpa on this journey
18:26:08 <Nude_Riker> giving the drug man cash before seeing drugs, spine tingling
18:26:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> eventually the french guy returns and we are like just hanging out and talking or whatever
18:26:27 <bonegar> this whole story has me sweating 
18:26:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> and after a while it has been a pretty long time and everyone is getting antsy and also the french guy starts trying to get the girls into the bathroom
18:27:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i keep 'having to use the bathroom' every time he tries to get one of them in there because they clearly don't want this to happen
18:27:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> it is all a very sloppy mess
18:27:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> the guy who is with them is too heavily on xanax to assist in this at all, he cant even talk
18:28:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> eventually i tell the guy ok we're not playing around anymore this is bullshit and the girls are really mad but not because he keeps being a creep but because we have not gotten the coke
18:28:28 <registered_mirc> lol
18:29:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> and he like, in a very fuckin french way is like 'oh well you know i am so sorry but i do not know what to tell you there is maybe no cocaine' and they start angrily demanding their money back and hes like 'ah well you see i do not anymore have it but what will you do, call police'
18:29:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> then one of them somehow manages to get hold of his phone and tries to leave with it
18:29:37 <Nude_Riker> lol
18:30:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> anything that happened in this period is increasingly blurry but i had to keep everyone apart and stop an actual physical fight from happening (this was the first time the other guy said anything as he was 'trying to help' also by going 'uhh.. hey' a few times)
18:30:20 <registered_mirc> i would be so miserable, its good that you seemed to take it in stride
18:30:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> anyway we all end up outside the building with no cocaine and no money, my phone is dead and this was pre-smartphone for me or anyone else in the group anyway so i had no idea where we were, but it's light out at this point
18:31:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> and im apologizing to the girls and telling them uhh yeah im really sorry that happened and theyre like its fine whatever, you just need to get us back to chinatown because we need to get on the bus back to bostin
18:31:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> boston*
18:31:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> and im like yeah cool i can make that happen but i have no idea where we are in relation to any trains or anything
18:31:59 <Nude_Riker> lol
18:32:06 <Nude_Riker> tom di arranga
18:32:20 <Rusty> makin shit happen
18:32:28 <Rusty> Easy Tommy
18:32:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> at this point i completely black out, and i still have no idea how i managed to get them there but i did manage to get them to chinatown, and i know that i got them to chinatown because i woke up on a bench in a subway station in chinatown
18:32:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
18:32:58 <Nude_Riker> lmao
18:33:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> the epilogue to the story is that i was carrying this beanie with me that i had found on the floor at the show and which i was holding the cds i bought at the show in, and i fell asleep on the bench holding it like between my knees in both hands, like a little open bag
18:33:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> and when i woke up there was about $27 in it
18:33:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> from people who had put money in it because they thought i was begging
18:33:43 <Rusty> omg
18:33:45 <Rusty> incredible
18:33:54 <bonegar> lol
18:33:58 <bonegar> miracle ending
18:34:08 <scoop_jackson> lol
18:34:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfaoooo
18:34:17 <Nude_Riker> loool
18:34:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> that got me all my money back that i lost on the coke proposition
18:34:22 <Nude_Riker> amazing
18:34:42 <registered_mirc> Homie_in_a_geod: lmfao
18:34:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> anyway i probably learned some sort of lesson that night but i'm not really sure what
18:35:06 <registered_mirc> dont offer to get drugs for strangers
18:35:12 <registered_mirc> thats a good lesson
18:35:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> well i never did try to do that again
18:35:20 <registered_mirc> i mean, unless you want to go on a ride
18:35:22 <registered_mirc> then you can
18:35:28 <Nude_Riker> ive just learned something powerfully terrible: bob dylan and his son co-founded an  NFT trading site called... snowcrash
18:35:29 <scoop_jackson> was this before or after we went to the thing with hieroglyphic being and you  climbed that fence to sleep by the trash
18:35:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> i also never yelled WHERES THE COCAINE on the sidewalk anywhere again
18:35:40 <Rusty> Nude_Riker oh no
18:35:46 <bonegar> maybe also wait until they have the cocaine to give them the money
18:35:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> scoop_jackson: that was definitely around the same time lol
18:35:56 <bonegar> idk i've never purchased or seen cocaine irl
18:35:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think before though
18:36:06 <scoop_jackson> someoen once yelled like that asking for ketamine in a bathroom 
18:36:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i will always ask for ketamine
18:36:25 <scoop_jackson> ive never tried cocaine b/c i would get addicted
18:36:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> generally now whenever i go out it's with the ketamine guy so i neve rhave to hunt for it
18:36:36 <Nude_Riker> the only time i have done or purchased cocaine is on my extremely long accidental valentine's day first date which i have talked about before
18:36:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> 4 lokos were involved in this story as well as every other one of my stupidest stories
18:36:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> coke is boring
18:36:54 <Rusty> lol
18:36:56 <Nude_Riker> when my date ended up blowing her dealer while i waited with her friend and the dealer's friends
18:36:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's just like adderall but condensed into 45 min
18:37:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> O_O
18:37:03 <scoop_jackson> O_O
18:37:04 <bonegar> i've never tried it, but i think i would maybe try it once if i wanted to be really annoying
18:37:17 <scoop_jackson> i do not recall this story matt
18:37:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's not a good date
18:37:32 <Nude_Riker> i said blowing but they might have had some other type of sex, i did not verify
18:37:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> sex style sex
18:37:54 <bonegar> did you get any free drugs from the dealer?
18:38:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> if youre a person who has difficulty having fun around people because you have the constant nagging feeling that everyone hates you and that you are not worth their time, there is nothing better at turning that off than the combination of cocaine and alcohol
18:38:01 <Nude_Riker> i just imagine that if you are performing a sex act for drugs its probably oral
18:38:09 <bonegar> lol
18:38:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> turning that off and making you feel the opposite of that way, in fact
18:38:22 <registered_mirc> cocaine has been fun before but looking back it's largely been annoying
18:38:38 <Nude_Riker> my impression of cocaine was "this is like amphetamines but not as good"
18:38:46 <registered_mirc> its more fun when you dont pay for it
18:38:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive never actually bought my own cocaine
18:39:07 <registered_mirc> i have but it was like, buying for the purpose of sharing
18:39:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive paid to 'go in on it' with friends but its never been my supply
18:39:10 <Nude_Riker> i got a couple of free lines and then also bought $140 worth of cocaine, most of which i flushed down the toilet the next day
18:39:22 <registered_mirc> i would never have bought cocaine to do by myself
18:39:23 <registered_mirc> that's nuts
18:39:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> the only times ive ever had my own cocaine were times i found cocaine
18:39:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> of which there have been... a few
18:39:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> working at music venues will allow for this sometimes
18:39:57 <bonegar> my anxiety about being annoying and making people not like me is very grounded and real, and if were to cast off those mental chains there's strong potential for me to become a huge terror but maybe not idk
18:40:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> my friend worked at rock the bells one year and the security had like, a dedicated garbage can they were throwing all the confiscated drugs into
18:40:28 <Nude_Riker> anyway thats the highlight of the story, but a fun detail about the morning (that part was at like 1am) was when we realized we had known each other on facebook a few years before and the first thing she said was "oh youve seen my tits"
18:40:30 <Rusty> picturing the legend of zelda 'secret revealed' jingle as you pick up a bag of powder
18:40:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> and at the end when the bosses were leaving and it was just security and sanitation crew everyone just took whatever they wanted from the can
18:40:46 <Nude_Riker> after realizing that
18:40:54 <Rusty> lol
18:42:22 <Nude_Riker> i didnt realize i had scheduled a date for valentines day, i was sitting in the cafe waiting for her thinking damn its busy as hell
18:42:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> this guys cool https://twitter.com/Yxng66/status/1499438476818890755
18:43:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> promoting your topical soundcloud rap in the replies to a tweet by the belarus minister of foreign affairs ftw
18:43:32 <Nude_Riker> lol
18:43:52 <Nude_Riker> time to create clean laundry from the raw material of dirty laundry
18:44:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> this song is kind of good 
18:44:11 <greatest_gamer> the ukraine war means we‚Äôll get some US-funded RAC and NSBM down the road
18:44:13 <greatest_gamer> pretty cool
18:44:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think probably it's best to buy oyur own drugs rather than doing sex stuff for them
18:44:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> this guy says "bitch im tryin to buy a zebra before the nuke drop"
18:44:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> greatest_gamer: surely it wont be the first time
18:45:12 <greatest_gamer> sorry us govt funded, i‚Äôve been funding it for quite some time
18:45:20 <ehn> anti war sign Nukes Make Me PUKE
18:45:44 <bonegar> are they still invading? crazy it takes this long to invade 
18:45:56 <greatest_gamer> i saw norg link skroll doing a RAC bit in nmd and was very pleased
18:46:00 <greatest_gamer> the gift that keeps on giving
18:46:21 <NORG> lol
18:49:12 <bonegar> too bad communism was invented in russia and not usa
18:50:17 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah we would have done communism better
18:50:32 <Nude_Riker> honestly that was probably the best date ive ever been on, which says more about the overall quality of dates i have been on
18:50:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've never been on a date
18:50:54 <bonegar> absolutely refusing to substantiate my statement, i think so too
18:50:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> not sometihng that was explicitly planned as a date anyway'
18:51:01 <Nude_Riker> i havent been on that many
18:51:21 <bonegar> trying to think about the best date i've been on
18:51:23 <Nude_Riker> i know a number of people who go on like 4-7 first dates a week and i just cannot imagine
18:51:33 <Nude_Riker> truly outside my comprehension
18:51:46 <bonegar> i can think of some
18:52:07 <bonegar> but the problem with it is they're always fake, which i guess is the point..
18:52:17 <Nude_Riker> what do you mean by fake
18:52:24 <bonegar> just playing pretend
18:52:26 <bonegar> you know
18:52:34 <Nude_Riker> i think thats kind of dates in general
18:52:37 <bonegar> yes
18:52:43 <bonegar> thats what im saying
18:52:51 <bonegar> it's all playing pretend so good or bad doesn't matter too much
18:53:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/KdMeZewp/20220303_135234.jpg
18:53:22 <Nude_Riker> right, "good" meaning "i enjoy telling people the funny things that happened" not "enjoyable" or "led to any connection"
18:54:39 <bonegar> showing your funny little things collection to your date
18:55:17 <Nude_Riker> the end was also funny, i drove her and her friend across the entire city of los angeles to drop them off at an emo night and did not join them
18:55:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> Jack Harlow to Star in New White Men Can‚Äôt Jump Reboot
18:55:32 <bonegar> nothing wrong with that
18:55:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> fantastic
18:55:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> why would you do fake things if you're trying to feel out if you wanna be in a romanticv relationship with someone
18:55:42 <bonegar> .gis jack harlow
18:55:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't understand that
18:55:54 <Nude_Riker> its not fake so much as contrived
18:56:09 <bonegar> what's the distinction
18:56:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk the difference between doing 'real' things and doing 'fake' things
18:56:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> no one is 'real' all of the time except some crazy people probably
18:56:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> dan quinn
18:56:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> me
18:56:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> hmm picard is back
18:56:54 <scoop_jackson> tom you need to do the epistomology quiz you are talking about epistomology
18:56:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> i did that already
18:56:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> do i dare watch this season
18:57:03 <scoop_jackson> oh thanks
18:57:04 <scoop_jackson> i missed it
18:57:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> i got some fuckin european with a mustache who id never heard of
18:57:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i didnt broadcast my answer
18:57:18 <bonegar> real things are like...if you plant a bush poorly in a yard and it dies, fake things are like, telling someone you want to plant a bush over dinner, but you really do not want to
18:57:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> the questions dont apply to me anyway
18:57:20 <scoop_jackson> lol
18:57:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont do research
18:57:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> why say something you don't mean
18:57:33 <Nude_Riker> in this case i would say the difference is context and purpose, there is no other reason to be doing the thing other than interacting with the other person, vs a "real" thing where you are engaged in an activity and the interaction is organic
18:57:33 <bonegar> 'research'
18:57:44 <bonegar> this is like... with the dumb guy in m DM group says 'research'
18:57:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if i say i want to plant a bush i want to plant a bush
18:57:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> you dont have to say things you dont mean to not be 'real'
18:58:00 <bonegar> 'i was doing my morning research' = 'googling dumb shit'
18:58:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> 1:55:50 PM <shrimp1989dspinfo> why would you do fake things if you're trying to feel out if you wanna be in a romanticv relationship with someone
18:58:08 <the_tasteful_nerd> its a dance
18:58:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> sounds gay
18:58:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> you can also not say things youre thinking, or come up with nicer ways to say things that youre thinking
18:58:26 <Nude_Riker> i think gays mostly dont do it, ironically
18:58:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> to see how much you each would like to reveal to one another
18:58:33 <bonegar> a lot of people love to pretend to love to plant bushes but they hate it
18:58:38 <bonegar> and it tires me out
18:58:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have never meant this more than i mean it right now, as pertinetn to this conversation:
18:58:48 <Nude_Riker> thats true bonegar 
18:58:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> we live in a society
18:58:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ^
18:58:56 <bonegar> 'we'
18:58:58 <bonegar> you mean you
18:59:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> you do too
18:59:05 <Nude_Riker> we live in societies
18:59:10 <bonegar> not me
18:59:14 <bonegar> im feral
18:59:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> you wish
18:59:20 <bonegar> i really do not
18:59:26 <bonegar> i wish i lived in society i think
18:59:30 <Nude_Riker> many of which are overlapping but very different
18:59:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> time for meeting
18:59:59 <bonegar> i guess by abstaining from many things maybe i am participating
19:00:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> even phiz is a form of society...

19:01:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> Fort,    Night.
19:01:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> because no tools required for assembly
19:01:57 <bonegar> none?
19:01:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah, except you.
19:02:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> nope
19:02:05 <bonegar> it didnt even come w/ a lil allen wrench?
19:02:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> no
19:02:25 <bonegar> wow
19:02:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> only tools i see hear are will and the music that im currently listening to
19:02:30 <bonegar> im impressed 
19:02:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l
19:03:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l georbush
19:03:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> there are two thumb screws for the center rail but thats it for hardware
19:03:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> the rest is just U joints or we
19:03:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> im actually going to listen to this entire song
19:03:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> https://www.thuma.co/products/the-bed
19:03:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> thats the bed.
19:04:11 <bonegar> nice
19:04:24 <bonegar> this is basically just a better version of my bed
19:04:40 <bonegar> same thing but required *spits* tools
19:04:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah it seems like an ikea type bed with quality materials
19:04:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> basically
19:05:01 <bonegar> and i had to put a nail through it because the wood was warped but i was too depressed to exchange it at the time
19:05:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> but i brought it in and put it together myself in like 30 min
19:05:26 <bonegar> nice
19:05:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> this tool song isnt very good
19:05:46 <bonegar> very expensive though, seeing that
19:05:58 <bonegar> but i dunno how much wood costs these days
19:06:00 <bonegar> probably lots
19:06:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> going to  listen to a song by a related artist to tool
19:06:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l
19:06:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> much better
19:06:20 <bonegar> .g wood prices
19:06:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> do you remember when geor bush said 'need some wood'
19:06:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpMpxIvnGbo good eric video relevant to tool chat
19:07:24 <bonegar> i only remember 'watch this drive' something like good job brownie? idk, and the time he dodged the shoe and something like fool me once. wont get fooled again
19:07:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FSwujFqH70
19:07:49 <Nude_Riker> yeah i dont remember the wood
19:08:00 <Nude_Riker> george bush: gimme some reggae
19:08:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> 2:05:59 PM <bonegar> but i dunno how much wood costs these days
19:08:18 <Nude_Riker> lmao "The line that garnered Mr Bush a second term against his heated rival Mr John F Kerry.
19:08:18 <Nude_Riker> "
19:08:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> i remember watching this in 2004 and talking about it with my online friends on irc at the time
19:08:30 <Nude_Riker> his heated rival
19:08:33 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah we bougbt a cheapo bed like 12 years ago
19:08:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> so i figured time for a big boy bed
19:08:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> during this debate george bush also said "they've got battling green eye-shades" apropos of nothing and i still to this day don't understand it
19:08:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> that will hopefully last until i doe
19:08:50 <bonegar> ya for sure
19:08:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> die
19:08:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> no one really even talked about it

19:28:24 <ajj2> I was exploring whether there might be a big event at night only in some fort because I see the kind of message "Fort, night" everywhere in Eldenling, but apparently people who are playing in English are crying because it seems to be a message that is just making Fortnite and laughing by combining Fort and Night.
19:28:26 <ajj2> rofl

20:06:10 <Nude_Riker> laughing again at the torrent site thread i found where people were debating what tag to use for content using the n word

20:07:46 <registered_mirc> john is on the true path
20:07:51 <Nude_Riker> its porn torrents so its actually referring to content people might want to find specifically for that lmao
20:08:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
20:08:25 <the_tasteful_nerd> hshahaha
20:08:33 <registered_mirc> damn, rule 34
20:08:57 <registered_mirc> i had not considered porn intentionally using language like that
20:09:04 <bonegar> 'so there i was, reading a debate about the n-word in the porno comment section when i...'
20:09:31 <Nude_Riker> its very advanced library sciences
20:09:42 <bonegar> i thought about it for a moment, then i realized that maybe the word does have to be specific
20:10:26 <Nude_Riker> the porn torrent site has the best comments, i have one screenshot ive been resisting posting for ages where the comment thread on a torrent was concerned people noticing this guy was uploading more and more disturbing content and were worried he was going to kill himself
20:10:28 <bonegar> easy imagine that racism is an important part of some peoples porno methodology
20:10:54 <Nude_Riker> so its like insane hentai avatars going "bro it gets better"
20:11:00 <bonegar> lol
20:11:27 <bonegar> i've always imagined guys masturbating together being supportive to eachother about it, but that might not be the reality
20:11:48 <registered_mirc> lol
20:11:54 <registered_mirc> like they're working out together
20:11:54 <bonegar> like yawning or laughing
20:11:59 <bonegar> yea
20:11:59 <registered_mirc> "yeah bro, get it"

20:33:59 <scoop_jackson> bad name for a weapon imo
20:34:24 <lavender_toni> weaponise the pad
20:34:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> manpads
20:35:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> an apartment building in silver spring blew up
20:35:55 <scoop_jackson> uh
20:36:42 <scoop_jackson> you okay het?
20:37:10 <registered_mirc> they should be called manipedis
20:38:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Hall said he left the building earlier Thursday and had smelled something.
20:38:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ‚ÄúWhen I left this morning, I told my grandma, ‚ÄòIt smells like gas,‚Äô‚Äù Hall said.
20:38:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> cool
20:39:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's great that massive complexes can just have gas leaks and management companies won't do anything about it
20:42:05 <bonegar> classic
20:42:38 <bonegar> here's what management companies are good at: managing to take your money
20:43:10 <registered_mirc> thats a thing i have feared at my place not because i dont think my landlord would fail to fix it, but because my building is ancient and who knows what kinds of problems can develop
20:44:37 <lavender_toni> someone left a disassembled cabinet outside our building front door and its been there for three weeks now
20:45:21 <het> shrimp1989dspinfo: oh shit
20:45:25 <bonegar> any plans for it?
20:46:20 <het> apparently that's in downtown silver spring
20:46:47 <lavender_toni> i dont nmeed a cabinet
20:46:50 <het> holy shit there's video https://www.fox5dc.com/news/silver-spring-explosion-video-shows-moment-blast-destroys-apartment-building

20:49:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this article has much more information
20:49:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i live in a house bonegar
20:49:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> a duplex specifically
20:49:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and not in maryland
20:49:48 <bonegar> im being attacked
20:50:07 <pubeman77> someone should send me a switch oled
20:50:12 <bonegar> lol
20:50:30 <het> lol Marc Elrich not the most eloquent extemporaneously it appears:
20:50:30 <het> "It was kind of horrifying. I mean, when you look at a building and see it gutted with the walls down and all the debris piled up, all I could think is, 'What happened to the people?' Hopefully, they're at work. If they were home, you got to ask yourself, like, what happend to them?" Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich said.
20:50:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
20:50:48 <ajj2> lmao
20:50:49 <ajj2> damn
20:50:58 <ajj2> im glad theres no deaths at least
20:51:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> well not yet
20:51:13 <registered_mirc> some ppl are missing
20:51:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but the building was basically vaporized
20:51:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> 12 units based on counting the outlines on the wall
20:51:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> could be basement units as well which would bump it up to 16
20:52:26 <bonegar> https://twitter.com/pinatafarms/status/1499476329821057030
20:52:58 <het> lol I pasted that earlier, it's so awful
20:53:14 <het> I didn't realize she was mark zuckerberg's sister which explains why it has weirdly high production value
20:53:18 <lavender_toni> in finnish you can call an unpleasant task or thing "wiener". i was talking about some boring work thing earlier and called it a "shitty wiener"
20:53:20 <lavender_toni> not related to anything
20:53:27 <lavender_toni> just had a translator moment like "oh thats weird"
20:53:40 <bonegar> randi 'hold my beer'd'd razzlekahn and yes she did break the internet
20:54:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wiener
20:54:51 <bonegar> shitty wiener
20:55:07 <bonegar> so like you say 'wiener' like 'wiener'?
20:55:29 <lavender_toni> no the word is nakki
20:55:37 <lavender_toni> i knew a japanese girl called that once
20:55:39 <lavender_toni> it wa sfunny to me
20:55:42 <pubeman77> perkele
20:55:46 <bonegar> yea finnish/japanese has hilarious overlap
20:55:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> nakki
20:56:09 <bonegar> words like shika
20:56:16 <bonegar> so what does nakki mean
20:56:20 <pubeman77> zika
20:56:36 <bonegar> because wiener to me evokes the chicagoland area very powerfully to me
20:56:41 <pubeman77> bring back zika
20:56:45 <bonegar> i imagine a fat guy with a mustache eating a hot dog and walking the hot dog style dog
20:57:02 <bonegar> .gis nikka

23:27:56 <alansmithee_> i'm only like lvl 34 but that bloodhound fang seemed to chunk him ok
23:28:14 <alansmithee_> and i watched a streamer on him for like an hour so i kinda knew some of the attack patterns and when you can punish
23:32:17 <bonegar> some players just have no survivability
23:38:42 <bonegar> (me)

23:49:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't like playing on normal mode
23:49:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i need to unlock hyper mode >: (
23:49:46 <bonegar> beat godrick
23:49:49 <bonegar> second try
23:50:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i need to do that
23:50:28 <alansmithee_> nice,, godrick getting wrecked
23:50:37 <alansmithee_> and shrimp1989dspinfo yeah it takes forever to get levels
23:50:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wait i'm an idiot
23:50:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it says right in the screenshot that i unlocked hyper mode
23:50:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
23:51:13 <alansmithee_> yeah you don't need to fully beat it to unlock that
23:51:32 <dreddybajs> omg i just got a summon ashes with the greatest pun name 
23:51:35 <dreddybajs> wont spoil
23:51:42 <bonegar> i unlocked dairy world but i have elden brain
23:51:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> what if it was hocap
23:52:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> any gamers wanna hang out in voice
23:52:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol im lv 38 and got owned by margit cause i am fail
23:52:42 <bonegar> whats after godrick
23:52:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you and alansmithee_ should battle him together
23:52:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you're both on ps5 right
23:53:15 <alansmithee_> i believe so
23:53:24 <alansmithee_> i can jump in, how does that summoning stuff work
23:53:49 <registered_mirc> i just started a ps4 game too but it will probably take me a while to catch up
23:54:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wait what
23:54:15 <registered_mirc> bonegar: after godrick is raya lucaria
23:54:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> did you buy two copies
23:54:23 <registered_mirc> i did buy two copies
23:54:32 <bonegar> oh hmm
23:54:39 <bonegar> i did a lot of that, i beat the dog at least
23:54:49 <bonegar> doing this all outta order
23:55:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> to play mp you'll place your summoning symbol down using the finger in your inventory (i forget the name). will will have to craft a summoning item to bring you into his world
23:55:10 <registered_mirc> im right there too, about to go into the boss of raya lucaria but the fight is very strange and i dont completely understand it yet
23:55:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's easier if you set a pw for multiplayer (we used eldphiz) 
23:55:36 <registered_mirc> use a group password
23:55:37 <bonegar> we squaddin up?
23:55:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that'll be under the multiplayer subsection of the settings menu
23:55:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and you'll also want to make sure your mp settings are enabled
23:55:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm not in the game so i don't have the exact names for all the settings
23:56:16 <registered_mirc> im taking a break right now but i would maybe be up for it later
23:56:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> will and alan are on ps5 so i am explaining tihs for them if they wanna play together
23:56:43 <registered_mirc> oh right duh lol
23:56:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ciaran and i both summoned homies to beat margit because he sucks ass
23:57:13 <alansmithee_> is there anything that makes you run faster? 
23:57:23 <registered_mirc> i dont think so
23:57:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hold circle
23:57:30 <bonegar> lol
23:57:32 <registered_mirc> lol
23:57:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's the sprint button
23:57:34 <bonegar> low weight and high end will help
23:57:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> nothing else
23:57:48 <bonegar> high dex and high poise will give you some auto dodging
23:57:57 <registered_mirc> wait alan have you not been sprinting or do you mean faster sprint speed?
23:58:09 <alansmithee_> well for one,, i haven't been sprinting lol
23:58:13 <alansmithee_> but also faster sprint speed
23:58:13 <registered_mirc> damn!
23:58:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> horse
23:58:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> torrent
23:58:23 <registered_mirc> yeah horse
23:59:36 <bonegar> yea there are world map places where summoning torrent is just the way to go it becomes obvious
23:59:37 <alansmithee_> can't do that in here
23:59:50 <alansmithee_> i'm trying this weird maze puzzle place near the starting area
