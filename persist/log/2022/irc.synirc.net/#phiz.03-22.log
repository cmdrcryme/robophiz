13:21:09 <Selfie_Dad> hmm
13:21:17 <Selfie_Dad> is that a percentage of all attempts

14:24:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> 209 on scail today
14:24:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> light as i've been since... a week ago
14:24:43 <Selfie_Dad> ftw
14:24:45 <mpg> i will never weigh myself unless im in a doctors office
14:25:15 <Selfie_Dad> thats fine
14:25:48 <Selfie_Dad> its useful information in certain contexts but not for the day to day
14:26:11 <Selfie_Dad> man
14:26:26 <Selfie_Dad> i really am trying to avoid buying a tv or monitor from amazon lol
14:26:34 <mpg> oof
14:26:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> im glad i got analog scale because all the digital scales on bb&b seemed either bad or over priced
14:26:48 <Selfie_Dad> but every model sold at brick and mortars near me suck dick according to the reviews i read
14:27:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i am kind of wishing that i had one that gave me a body fat reading
14:27:03 <mpg> i dont think i will be much help since im the DO IT meme
14:27:05 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i wasnt impressed with their digi scale 
14:27:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk how it would fuckign know that
14:27:26 <mpg> .gis emperor DO IT
14:27:29 <Selfie_Dad> the body fat readings on scales are basically as good as an estimation
14:27:38 <Selfie_Dad> so dont worry about it
14:27:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> alright
14:28:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> fedex says new stationary bike seat is coming today but last scan was in ohio so i doubt that
14:28:13 <Selfie_Dad> you can get a more accurate reading by taking body measurements and plugging it into a calculator that uses the navy formula
14:28:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> What that means.
14:28:44 <mpg> my friend messaged me that someone tested pos at the bday party i was at on sunday
14:28:47 <mpg> lovely
14:28:53 <mpg> and im supposed to see fennesz tonight
14:28:59 <Selfie_Dad> u just had it, ur probably fine
14:29:06 <Selfie_Dad> but even that is only gonna get you probably w/in like 3% of the real number
14:29:06 <mpg> so i have a covid test coming to me today
14:29:23 <Selfie_Dad> tom u like, use tape measure to measure waist, hip, ankle, neck, wrist
14:29:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> look at wrist
14:29:48 <Selfie_Dad> and there are calculators that take those measurements + height and weight and can deliver a reasonable estimate of bf%
14:30:06 <Selfie_Dad> last time i did it, it told me i was ike 15.5-16% bf
14:30:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> the site i just went to only has waist and neck when i googled it
14:30:19 <Selfie_Dad> and my scale was telling me i was 18.9% bf
14:30:29 <Selfie_Dad> so i just assume the real number is like, inbetween those somewhere
14:30:45 <Selfie_Dad> only real way to know for sure is to pay for a dxa scan
14:30:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> where do you measure your waist for this
14:31:01 <Selfie_Dad> i believe around where ur belly button is
14:31:08 <Selfie_Dad> and hip is like the widest part of your hips
14:31:17 <Selfie_Dad> let me see if i can find the calculator i used
14:32:19 <Selfie_Dad> https://www.fitmatic.com/body/calculator/results?id=c072579e-d14a-414a-a7d4-8f1a4ffbd9c4
14:32:30 <Selfie_Dad> oh whoops thats my result page i guess
14:32:36 <Selfie_Dad> but you can just hit 'start over'

14:33:06 <Selfie_Dad> god every monitor and tv that walmart and staples have sucks dick lmao
14:33:11 <Selfie_Dad> and we dont have a best buy
14:33:52 <Rusty> we need to replace the shitty small tv in our gym and i'm just waiting for a decent free curb option tbh
14:33:53 <Selfie_Dad> plugging in monitor model numbers into rtings and getting ratings like 5.3/10
14:34:07 <Rusty> it's currently some cursed sony/"google tv" thing that's apparently just a netbook in a tv's body
14:34:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> ok well i did the measurements and it is way lower than i estimated
14:35:23 <Selfie_Dad> yeah so just assume the real % is somewhere w/n like 2.5-3% of that
14:35:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> it gave me 23.7%
14:35:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i think i plugged 35% in on the calculator
14:35:36 <Selfie_Dad> that seems reasonable
14:35:40 <Selfie_Dad> 35% is a lot
14:36:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk it gave little body diagram things and my body looked most like the one that was 35%
14:36:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> Congratulations! You meet the US Navy body fat standards!
14:36:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh good.
14:36:16 <NORG> lo
14:36:16 <Selfie_Dad> i think you'd be quite a bit heavier if you were 35%
14:36:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> i can join the navy now.
14:36:19 <NORG> l
14:36:24 <NORG> Congratulations!
14:36:43 <Selfie_Dad> i need to do it again, i am now 10lbs lighter than last time i took it
14:36:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> well im going to change the initial estimate i made on macrofactor to 25 and put in 23.7 for current i guess
14:37:19 <Selfie_Dad> you can add it in the weigh in page
14:37:21 <the`shima> rememeber the whole thing about my friend who got cancelled like 20 months ago and was still getting hounded
14:37:26 <Selfie_Dad> where you add the weights
14:37:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah but i think i should change the original from 35 to 25
14:37:45 <Selfie_Dad> the original doesnt matter past initial setup
14:37:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont want it to think ive already lost 12%
14:37:55 <the`shima> his ex who did that has split with her current bf and done the same thing again + apparently people now are like "i think i might have been wrong about ross all along!"
14:38:07 <Selfie_Dad> the algorithim doesnt do a _ton_ w/ that info anyway
14:38:12 <Selfie_Dad> its really more about the cals and the weight
14:38:33 <Selfie_Dad> you can just set it in the weight page and thats what it will assume is the current bf% for all addtl calculation
14:39:10 <the`shima> meanwhile ive been invited to a birthday party of a friend/guy i had a few flings with and a bunch of people are gonna there who totally blanked me last time they saw me in the bar + were going off instagram about people like me being friends with abusers. apparently they have changed their tune a bit now according to one of my friends but ugh i just dunno if i wanna go
14:40:07 <Selfie_Dad> the math in the algorithim is set up to prioritize recent values of input and as previous values grow further distant in time they have less to do with the updates it will make, and by a certain point they are completely irrelevant
14:40:24 <the`shima> find this space very frustrating where its just like "Oh yeah I got these things totally wrong and got involved in something I shouldn't have but I guess we should just put it all aside and be buddies now!" shit
14:40:47 <Selfie_Dad> i dunno what to do there man
14:40:56 <the`shima> yeah its just annoying
14:41:05 <Selfie_Dad> i'd probably just not go unless u really dont want the friend to feel like you snubbed him
14:42:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> according to macrofactor i will be down to 205 lbs in 30 days
14:42:43 <the`shima> its not just the party i guess but this is coming up more and more. my friend got totally ostracized from everybody, thrown out of bands, etc and only two of us were there for him. it was really hard and needed us to be critical of him while offering support and ensuring he was getting help. all while people were like "I CANT BELIEVE YOU ARE FRIENDS WITH ABUSERS!" and i got sidelined from stuff in this city
14:42:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i am also going to shows like the next 5 days which does not bode well there

14:47:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> Look at the mess that we're in. Look at the mess that we're in. As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said, we should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.
14:47:45 <antiracist_baby> as far as the cyber
14:48:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> And I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the internet, they're beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is a, it is a huge problem. I have a son.
14:48:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly do-able. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing, but that's true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester and certainly cyber is one of them.
14:48:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmao

14:50:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzYEMVGvM4#t=20s
14:50:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> theres also videos from the actual debate but this was the shortest one
14:50:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> We talk about the hacking.
14:50:48 <antiracist_baby> we had it on lock. you needed a sequential number
14:50:49 <the`shima> the whole thing is here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57NH-GXbkQM&t=210s

14:51:01 <antiracist_baby> lmao
14:51:11 <antiracist_baby> its very funny how much hillary visibly hates trump
14:51:26 <bonegar> you needed a sequential number
14:51:29 <the`shima> I don’t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She’s saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don’t – maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?
14:51:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmao
14:51:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> .y trump saying bing
14:52:11 <NORG> the`shima did YOU watch the freakinG RACE?!?!?!
14:52:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> now in the old days Bing Bong
14:52:23 <the`shima> Under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with an internet, we came up with the internet.
14:52:23 <the`shima> And I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the internet, they're beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is a, it is a huge problem.
14:52:26 <antiracist_baby> it is very funny that hillary was denied being president by donald trump
14:52:28 <the`shima> ya i did NORG it ruled
14:52:42 <the`shima> We came in with an internet, we came up with the internet.
14:52:43 <NORG> are lewis on the podium through nothing but sheer skill
14:52:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> yes it is
14:52:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> We came in with an internet

14:53:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> thank you rusty
14:53:18 <the`shima> all the pundits here are like "They'll get it right!"
14:53:21 <NORG> i am not above rooting for ferrari tho if it means max is denied a title
14:53:27 <antiracist_baby> the toilet man came today for like 10 minutes, left to get some things and still hasnt come back
14:53:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o10xcWo2k04
14:53:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> the toilet man
14:53:51 <the`shima> ferrari and hass said they both looked at that car concept with the tiny pods and said it wasnt good so they discarded it early
14:53:57 <antiracist_baby> hillary is so eminently unlikeable that if you were voting on pure resentment like, i get it
14:53:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> why did you need another toilet man when youre already there
14:54:18 <the`shima> they managed to get their competitive and set up in bahrain after 7 days of testing/practise theyre not gonna have that elsewhere lol
14:54:47 <NORG> feels like the pundits just think o its mercedes they'll figure it out. cause theyre mercedes
14:54:53 <the`shima> ya
14:54:54 <NORG> but its obv a shitbox atm
14:54:54 <antiracist_baby> the whole toilet man situation is very annoying
14:55:04 <the`shima> plus the engine doesnt look good based on performance of their customer teams
14:55:13 <antiracist_baby> me mum ordered a toilet man and then fucked up to butlins for a week
14:55:15 <the`shima> im in for a ferrari vs rb title fight tho

14:57:22 <the`shima> guenter steiner rules so much lol
14:57:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> i feel like hillarys presidential candidacy was a major turning point for the ability of the general public to digest bravo tv type shit. because all of the people trying to make her likeable were very couched in that sort of like... old money gay media milieu. and i think that a lot of people my age used to enjoy that sort of thing but hate it now because of its attachment to hillary clinton
14:58:20 <the`shima> ya
14:58:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> formulating this thought as i go, i might be wrong
14:58:31 <the`shima> i do think theres legit a 'hillary clinton' type person/thing lol
14:58:36 <Rusty> you're not far off yeah
14:58:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> definitely
14:58:48 <the`shima> like i was telling my friend i dont like star trek discovery because it feels like its written by people who liked hillary clinton's speeches
14:58:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> lolll
14:58:57 <the`shima> and like thats the only way i can only describe it lol
14:59:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> is it Sorkinian
14:59:09 <bonegar> pivotal in forming the 'lib' archetype
14:59:15 <the`shima> remember when she was on that stupid sitcom people liked
14:59:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> broad city?
14:59:23 <the`shima> ya
14:59:32 <Rusty> i've only seen the gif
14:59:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> see broad city is a perfect example of something that i did find funny, at one point

14:59:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> actually id reckon that the first season is still pretty funny but im not going to go back and check
15:00:04 <the`shima> i watched like 20 minutes of broad city and didnt find anything worth liking
15:00:23 <the`shima> then again its probably not written for me so
15:00:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> hannibal buress was on that show and was funny on it
15:00:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> of course hes a landlord now so

15:08:12 <the`shima> You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it’s said in entertainment. Some of it’s said – somebody who’s been very vicious to me, Rosie O’Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.
15:08:12 <the`shima> But you want to know the truth? I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ‘I can’t do it. I just can’t do it. It’s inappropriate. It’s not nice.’ But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. They’re untrue. And they’re misrepresentations. And I will tell you this, Lester, it’s not nice. 
15:09:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmao
15:09:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> i can hear the trump "not nice" at the end so well

15:10:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> Some of it’s said – somebody who’s been very vicious to me, Rosie O’Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.

18:17:30 <Selfie_Dad> awesome!
18:17:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> i am glad you enjoyed your ipa dreddybajs 
18:18:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> i continued crushing on only connect after your departure
18:18:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> (not really but it was fun)
18:18:13 <dreddybajs> nice
18:18:16 <dreddybajs> only connect ftw
18:18:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> i want to be on only connect
18:18:30 <dreddybajs> my friend was on it
18:18:31 <HellaBrad> i watched another ep when i got up today and got two of them
18:18:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> we should have a team
18:18:50 <dreddybajs> his team got crushed by the eventual champions i think
18:19:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> HellaBrad: one time i got one of the sequence things on the first clue
18:19:09 <HellaBrad> still very cool, its an incredibly tough game
18:19:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> i was very proud of that
18:19:19 <HellaBrad> oh wow
18:19:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> but it was also something that i definitely had a distinct advantage on and would have been harder for a british person
18:20:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> the first clue of the sequence was 4. Francis
18:20:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> i got it from there but then it went
18:20:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> 3. Howe
18:20:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> 2. Messier
18:21:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> [i should note that this sequence was correct at the time but it is not anymore]
18:21:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> anyway the answer is 1. Gretzky
18:21:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> and it is the top 4 point scorers in NHL history
18:21:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> but #2 is jaromir jagr now, who was still active at the time they made that episode and had not yet passed any of those guys
18:22:33 <HellaBrad> nice! yeah i should know more hockey stats coming from edmonton but i never had the head for that
18:23:19 <HellaBrad> i got this one on the first clue but needed the second one before i would have guessed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRyCRxmVcs&t=240s (it is easy)
18:23:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> i am a very big hockey fan and i used to be obsessive about hockey stats when i was a kid
18:23:59 <HellaBrad> i had a big book of frogs
18:24:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> nice
18:24:34 <the`shima> im doing something on sunday thats been top of my list of things to do since lockdown
18:24:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> i did not get that one right away because i thought it was a sequence but i did successfully identify that the second thing there was a flying animal
18:24:52 <the`shima> gonna see a performance of gustav mahler
18:25:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> the second one is a sugar glider right
18:25:17 <Nude_Riker> nice the`shima
