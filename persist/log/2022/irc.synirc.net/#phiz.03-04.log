04:17:23 <pubeman77> they should trade the blues chychrun

04:26:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> man we're gonna pull francouz and the yotes are gonna get an empty net goal

04:48:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> nice
04:48:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> thank god i don't have to hold a beer can for 3 hours straight
04:48:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> not that anyone was even attempting to wear them at the rangers game when i last went
04:48:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> myself included
04:48:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah absolitely
04:48:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i haven't worn a mask in ages
04:48:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wear them on the subway but thats it
04:49:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> i havent gotten a cab in a while but id wear one in there too
04:49:28 <eric> u have to wear them in indoor public places still
04:49:30 <eric> stores and such
04:49:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i haven't done that in like a year
04:49:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> at least
04:50:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> i had been fully off wearing them in bodegas and stuff until omicron hit and then i started again
04:50:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> now i have stopped wearing them in there again 
04:50:36 <eric> that sounds nice
04:50:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> but you have to wear them on the subway and in cabs
04:50:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> id rather just wear them in those places than ruffle feathers
04:51:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think people should wear them when they are sick as a courtesy to others
04:51:14 <eric> i thought about just wearing them there for the future
04:51:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> or they should stay home when theyre sick but
04:51:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no one has ever said anything to me about not wearing one and i stopped way before you were "supposed to"
04:51:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> i understand that is not an option for everyone
04:51:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like the second it became optional i quit putting it on
04:52:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> it is not officially optional on the subway and i think still like 75-80% of people follow that rule
04:52:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wonder if i have to on nj transit
04:52:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i expect its going to be made optional soon
04:52:37 <eric> i reckon here too 
04:52:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> you still do on lirr so i would imagine you do on nj transit
04:53:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hm yeah it's a federal reg
04:53:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> for public transit
04:53:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wouldn't have even gotten vaccinated if work didn't require it and that was a whole ordeal for me that i'm still mad about
04:53:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> covid cases are the lowest theyve been in nyc since last summer
04:53:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hate my job
04:53:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> nice,
04:54:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i ahd like an all day meltdown over it
04:54:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've got a big needle problem
04:54:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> that sucks :[
04:54:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> at least they dont need to find a vein for those
04:54:35 <eric> yeep sorr y 2 hear
04:54:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and then i was way sicker than i was when i got the plague so i was extra pissed off about it
04:54:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> my veins are hard to find
04:54:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i could barely move for like two weeks
04:54:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i was just in constant physical pain
04:55:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i was very ill
04:55:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wehn i got the plague i just felt like i had a sinus infection. ez
04:55:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and now after all these restrictions are being lifted they're finally asking us for vaccination proof rofl
04:56:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have great veins
04:56:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> i didnt get sick til the start of the Cron surge and it was just like a particularly sneezy cold really
04:56:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my mom always says she's happy i'm afraid of needles because it would be easy for me if i got into heroin
04:56:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> one time i was donating blood and whenever i donate blood they like to take double red cells from me because i have good donor blood (o+)
04:57:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> so one time i was donating at school blood drive and they had me hooked up to the machine where it takes your blood and then whirls it around and gives you back the platelets and plasma
04:57:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i got the plague pretty early on when we didn't know as much and i was still actually nervous about it
04:57:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but once i got it i was like that's it??? fuck this and stopped caring
04:57:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> but they werent all the way in the vein so it was taking blood but then shooting stuff into my fuckin arm under the skin and i had this huge bruised purple lump on my arm for like 2 weeks
04:57:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao holy shit
04:58:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> it was very gross and uncomfortable
04:58:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it was actualyl cool wehn i got it because everyone at work acted like i was going to die
04:58:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so i got to take it easy for way longer than i should have
04:58:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> i feel like if id have gotten it early i absolutely would have gotten psychosomatic long covid
04:59:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the only thing that sucked was i couldn't taste or smell anything for like six weeks
04:59:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> by week 4 i was starting to cry over it
04:59:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but when i first lost it i was having fun tasting things
04:59:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like i drank vinegar like it was water
04:59:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
04:59:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> cool party trick
04:59:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> let me tell you - hot sauce sucks when you can't taste it
04:59:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when you can only feel it
05:00:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> MBS has told people close to him that the murder of Khashoggi was the "worst thing ever to happen to me." 
05:00:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> He told @gcaw and me that the murder "hurt me a lot. It hurt me and it hurt Saudi Arabia, from a feelings perspective." 
05:00:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmfao
05:00:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> from a feelings perspective
05:00:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> i hate to be hurt from a feelings perspective

05:09:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> the only dj name i recognize all of next week is ross from friend (because it is the worst dj name)
05:09:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> ross from friends
05:09:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't even recognize that
05:09:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> holy fuck
05:09:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh dj python on march 12
05:09:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> dj python is good
05:09:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there he is https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/DjufPrbH/image.png
05:09:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's him, that's the lifted guy
05:09:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
05:09:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> which one is he
05:09:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> nick kassebaum
05:10:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> well at least hes not the one who named himself escaflowne
05:10:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
05:10:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah hm i wonder if dj python would be any fun live
05:10:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> carl cox the weekend after that. thats a name i know
05:11:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> sick
05:11:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's wild he still spins
05:11:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and he's still really big
05:11:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> i feel like people going to the dj python thing are probably more likely than not just going to that place because it is 'the place to go dance' and its incidental whos actually spinning
05:11:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> where is it
05:11:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> nowadays
05:12:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> which is like a few blocks from my apt
05:12:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh that's where i saw kode9 and lee gamble
05:12:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that place is kinda.... idk
05:12:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's weird
05:12:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive never actually been in there
05:12:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> or actually thats not true a couple times i went there when i was already completely blackout and only had like 1 drink
05:12:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> nice dude
05:12:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i dont remember anything about what it was like
05:13:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> they have a permanent indoor space there now which they didnt always
05:13:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i get emails from them because of that one show and they're ALL horrible
05:13:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i hate hte way they're written
05:13:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh im sure theyre awful

05:19:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaDA_eUIDYE
05:19:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> all these places look the same
05:19:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> this is a good lies release
05:19:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i used to post on a forum with tzusing
05:19:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
05:19:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like many many years ago
05:20:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> basement is at knockdown center which is a gigantic complex in the middle of nowhere (maspeth)
05:20:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he and his dad had a bike rim business
05:20:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> idk if he's still doing it
05:20:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol cool
05:20:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but they made rims
05:20:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but yeah i think his music is really sick
05:20:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> i saw sunn o))) at knockdown center among other things
05:20:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wasn't unsound held there
05:20:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> uhhh maybe idk
05:21:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i didn't really understand what that was but the bug played and i wanted to go
05:21:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> it probabyl was
05:21:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i'm glad i didn't because it was some weird shit instead of his normal music
05:21:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> thinkies music instead of heavy bass
05:21:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wish i was dialed in enough to find out about more shit like this (industrial style techno)
05:21:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> keeping up with this type of music is too much work
05:21:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i can ask my roommate for recs if you want
05:22:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> mostly if i feel like listening to dance music i listen to this one xhin mix from like 2012 on youtube
05:22:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i should find the one ron morelli mix i really like
05:22:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> i used to have a lot of filez of stuff like that but i long since lost all my files
05:23:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it was a b2b thing he did with lee gamble
05:23:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> is stroboscopic artefacts still putting stuff out
05:23:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no diea
05:24:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> thge answer seems to be "rarely"
05:24:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh no i lied it was mumdance
05:24:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://soundcloud.com/rinsefm/mumdance080817
05:24:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this set is so good
05:24:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://store.stroboscopicartefacts.com/album/monad-v-sam005
05:24:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> i like stuff like this a lot
05:25:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you would like container
05:26:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA36WzvDINk
05:27:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah this sounds good
05:27:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> i havent been to a dj thing in such a long time lol
05:27:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> the last one i went to where i actually knew who was playing was in like
05:27:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> 2015 or 16 i guess
05:27:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> and it was vatican shadow
05:28:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol hell yeah
05:28:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> very weird scene
05:28:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the regis/ron morelli thing should be sick
05:28:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> i also get very self conscious about going to these things because i cannot dance
05:28:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> imo listen to the mumdance/ron morelli set during work or w/e
05:28:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i can't dance for shit but i don't care
05:28:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> im going to do work tonight and i am going to listen to it
05:28:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no one else can either
05:28:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> why are you working so late
05:29:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> because i dicked off all fuckin day today when i had shit i really needed to get done
05:29:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> nice
05:29:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> and it will be Problems for me tomorrow if i dont deal with at least a good part of it tonight
05:30:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive been ignoring this one project for months because its such a pain in the ass and basically lying to my supervisor that im almost done with it
05:30:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYLOGPr3Gs8
05:30:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> and just hoping that they dont actually call me out for not having it done anytime soon
05:30:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i think i am just about at the end of my rope with it
05:30:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this song ftw you'll like it probably
05:30:40 <het> does anyone do worldle
05:30:46 <het> because today's is ludicrous
05:30:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i had a project like that
05:30:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i just fought until they took me off it
05:31:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i did it until i lost all my browser tabs and then i stopped
05:31:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> het: lol i hadnt been doing it but wtf
05:33:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wtf even is this
05:34:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> i do not see why they even made this a possible answer lol
05:35:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43QqzJlNbr4
05:35:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think this song is insane
05:35:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's in that mix
05:35:17 <het> Homie_in_a_geod: yeah I don't understand either
05:35:45 <het> the name they use is obnoxious too when the outline is a specific subset of the name and they don't accept the name of that subset

14:20:40 <Nude_Riker> foldginger
14:26:13 <mikev> gota good one for you the_tasteful_nerd 
14:27:09 <mikev> Bring the strongest pepper spray and/or stun-gun you can find to every lift from now on and give that fucker a full dose of one or both if he tries that shit again.
14:27:10 <mikev> Make sure both of those things are legal in your area before doing either of them. Maybe tell the staff and/or po-po that he made you feel unsafe or threatened if they ask questions after.
14:27:11 <mikev> Also report his ass to gym security. In fact report him to security first and make sure they record it somehow; that'll boost your case later if you have to do either of the other two options.
14:27:22 <mikev> That's totally different. There is a big difference between "friendly conversation" and "strange gym weirdo approaching you out of nowhere to force unsolicited 'advice' on you or just be an asshole at a place where I am already self-conscious enough THANK YOU VERY MUCH". The former is perfectly okay, while the latter gets you introduced to my good friends Ol' Sparky and Li'l Spicy.
14:27:23 <mikev> NOTE: Just to clarify, I don't bring either of these things with me to the gym in real life, but I've also never been accosted by a gym weirdo before and I feel like I'd start bringing at least one of them with me if I ever DID have a run-in with a weirdo, if only as a confidence-booster and not to actually use on someone.
14:27:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> lmao
14:27:28 <the_tasteful_nerd> is this el penis
14:27:31 <mikev> yes
14:28:13 <Li`l_Spicy> bring mace to the gym!!
14:29:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> spray mace on the bars
14:30:02 <Li`l_Spicy> commit a first degree assault in a public place!  DO IT
14:31:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah it's cool
14:32:07 <Li`l_Spicy> lol wtf

15:06:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> lmao mike
15:06:37 <the_tasteful_nerd> Just to add to what everyone else has said, you may want to consider adding some forearm and wrist exercises. Your forearms and wrists will both get worked pretty good with what you're doing right now regardless, but doing some extra stuff to target them specifically can help you out a lot on things like bench press, curls, and OHP.

15:28:42 <greatest_gamer> one of my friends was fretting over the size of her sig and i sent this as a counterpoint
15:29:02 <registered_mirc> oh my god is that seriously someone's sig lmao
15:29:12 <greatest_gamer> yes
15:29:21 <greatest_gamer> that's a PDF print straight from outlook

15:29:32 <Nude_Riker> amazing
15:29:33 <greatest_gamer> i'd have to spend hours to fake this baby this is real deal shit
15:29:38 <registered_mirc> Professional Services
15:29:53 <mikev> Please let me know when it is done, please
15:29:59 <greatest_gamer> he has a whole ass meme in his sig
15:30:02 <registered_mirc> Please bro, please
15:30:30 <registered_mirc> Please tuck me in at night and kiss my forehead bro, please
15:30:37 <greatest_gamer> mikev: this guy drives a gigantic truck, has a loaded 45 revolver on his desk, molon labe shit all over his office walls, and wears 6 rings at a time on both hands including one that's a GIGANTIC gold spartan helmet
15:30:49 <mikev> lol
15:30:50 <greatest_gamer> oh and like 2 gold chains
15:30:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
15:31:00 <greatest_gamer> he's possible the only unique human being alive
15:31:06 <greatest_gamer> this guy is a fucking island
15:31:30 <mikev> Robert "2 Chainz" Johnson
15:31:42 <greatest_gamer> i ran into him once outside of the Office and he was wearing even more jewelry 
15:31:48 <greatest_gamer> he looks like white fat redneck shabba ranks
15:32:00 <registered_mirc> mr. T
15:32:14 <NORG> :) :)
15:32:21 <greatest_gamer> if you saw his style you would definitely see the parallel to shabba but yes lmao
15:33:10 <Nude_Riker> white fat redneck shabba ranks
15:33:11 <greatest_gamer> sometimes i like to imagine that his jewelry is directly inspired by shabba ranks whom he discovered through some happenstance 
15:33:26 <greatest_gamer> and it's a really pleasant thought environment to explore
15:34:02 <Nude_Riker> https://twitter.com/postingtwink/status/1499482997589884940
15:34:13 <greatest_gamer> unfortunately this guy also insists on having me do all of his most basic helpdesk work including setting up laptops and like making minor changes as pictured in the sig example
15:34:17 <scoop_jackson> Lmao
15:34:19 <greatest_gamer> and last week i had to bring The Hammer down
15:34:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he needs your help tweaking his sig
15:34:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the font isn't big enough
15:35:08 <greatest_gamer> i told my owner the magic words to get him to take anything away from me any time any where -i am doing a worse job in security to do helpdesk work 
15:35:26 <greatest_gamer> he shit himself when he realized there's a War involving Russia happening and i was Not looking at or doing anything security related
15:35:35 <greatest_gamer> and he told me to block that guy's number and he would handle it lmao
15:35:42 <Nude_Riker> looool
15:36:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hell yeah
15:36:30 <bonegar> decisions like that is why your owner is the owner 
15:36:41 <greatest_gamer> he's that kind of like 'soft rich' small business tyrant who expects steve jobs treatment for steve miller band money 
15:36:41 <mikev> lol mason
15:36:51 <bonegar> classic type of guy
15:37:02 <mikev> that is most small business owners
15:37:11 <bonegar> yea, the real boss babies
15:37:12 <mikev> HVAC repair company guys
15:37:12 <scoop_jackson> The American gentry
15:37:13 <greatest_gamer> he wants 24/7 on-demand service from our Chief Security Officer (no big deal) while not paying more than anyone else for our monthly service agreement
15:37:24 <greatest_gamer> i told my owner i'd keep doing it but only if we raised his monthly rate 10k and i get half
15:37:30 <greatest_gamer> he was not interested.
15:37:36 <bonegar> my landlord got rich as an HVAC installer lol
15:37:37 <NORG> When U come back to irc and realize mason is telling some long ass story and u gotta scroll up >>>
15:37:43 <greatest_gamer> sorry i take adderall
15:38:04 <bonegar> i just never read up and guess
15:38:23 <greatest_gamer> i treasure you bonegar
15:38:28 <bonegar> lol
15:38:50 <bonegar> using my context clues
15:39:14 <bonegar> reading up is a beta mentality, and absolutely not grindset
15:39:26 <NORG> good story i didnt quite follow this part [09:35] <greatest_gamer> i told my owner the magic words to get him to take anything away from me any time any where -i am doing a worse job in security to do helpdesk work 
15:39:27 <NORG> but that's not important
15:39:46 <greatest_gamer> the owner of our company only wants me working on cybersecurity for ourselves and our clients
15:39:58 <NORG> i dont quite understand 'what i think i do' being a cowboy lassoing giant cats either
15:40:01 <Nude_Riker> pain in my left ear canal is new today so i guess i will take the antibiotics just in case
15:40:19 <Nude_Riker> especially since bacterial infection is what i have been kind of assuming
15:40:19 <bonegar> herding cats is a famous phrase
15:40:23 <bonegar> I understand this
15:40:36 <NORG> congrats to herding cats
15:40:44 <bonegar> ear, nose, throat... they're always conspiring
15:41:23 <bonegar> check this out. [computer programmer voice] this is like herding cats
15:41:27 <Nude_Riker> god its so funny that an ENT immediately has to refer you to a dentist if it involves a tooth
15:41:35 <registered_mirc> that's pretty true bonegar
15:41:43 <Nude_Riker> stupid fucking system of dentistry not being real medicine
15:41:45 <registered_mirc> usually though, the cats being herded are the clients
15:42:05 <bonegar> ear. nose. throat. absolutely NOT fucking teeth 
15:42:14 <registered_mirc> lol
15:42:29 <registered_mirc> [insurance company] teeth are just too weird. we can't cover this.
15:42:40 <greatest_gamer> [samuel l jackson in pulp fiction] motherfucker we said THROAT do you have TEETH in your THROAT
15:42:42 <Nude_Riker> is there even an oral (non-tooth) doctor
15:42:47 <Nude_Riker> there are oral surgeons but...
15:42:51 <bonegar> i remember someone told me they would tear all the teeth out of eastern european women to avoid various health issues. no idea if that is true or why the person told me that.
15:42:51 <registered_mirc> ENT...
15:42:53 <greatest_gamer> they did surgery on a oral
15:43:06 <registered_mirc> throat doctors usually will look at mouth problems too unrelated to teeth
15:43:16 <registered_mirc> and may just be like 'see a dentist'
15:43:21 <Nude_Riker> honestly i kind of wish i just had a gap where this crown is
15:43:30 <Nude_Riker> tearing it out doesnt seem so bad
15:43:39 <dreddybajs> yeah theyre nice Homie_in_a_geod 
15:43:58 <bonegar> i have a dentist story, about the last time i went to the dentist which was many years ago now

15:49:12 <Melber> seems like you have a pretty direct line to whomever made that decision
15:49:18 <bonegar> but i think she was just 'between staff'
15:49:22 <Nude_Riker> yeah
15:49:58 <Nude_Riker> i think i will buy an overpriced quest hero bar with my antibiotics and flonase
15:50:29 <bonegar> its supposed to thunderstorm tomorrow and rain, so i should do shopping today and hiking but i'd rather just not eat any food and not dress myself
15:50:55 <bonegar> .gis quest hero bar

15:51:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> epic
15:51:48 <Nude_Riker> i did a freestyle yoga yesterday while listening to garage and it went well
15:52:04 <bonegar> does freestyle mean you're chosing your poses/flow?
15:52:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what did u listen to
15:52:06 <Nude_Riker> but i think im gonna do an old adriene 30 day
15:52:16 <Nude_Riker> yeah bonegar just doing what i wanted
15:52:35 <Nude_Riker> shrimp1989dspinfo, i was listening to this mix that i love https://soundcloud.com/djmurlo/garage-4x4-mix-dec-2015
15:52:46 <Nude_Riker> pls forward to me any garage sets you like
15:52:48 <bonegar> nice! yea it  feels so good to get to that stage of yoga... but the downside is it's easy to avoiding the more 'annoying' movements
15:53:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> garage ftw
15:53:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'll have to go through my folders and see
15:53:27 <Nude_Riker> yeah bonegar i was trying to consciously include the stuff i dont always like but know is good like this 3 legged dog to 1 legged plank thing
15:53:39 <Nude_Riker> get that core working
15:53:49 <bonegar> gotta focus on the core
15:54:36 <scoop_jackson> i was doing garage yoga while listening to freestyle
15:54:37 <Nude_Riker> really the only parts i usually find annoying are going back and forth through like forward folds, feels like a waste of time
15:54:44 <bonegar> i mostly avoid extended triangle pose/trikonasana stuff
15:54:51 <bonegar> idk why. it just never feels pleasant
15:55:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> scoop_jackson we were talking about going to this last night https://ra.co/events/1502210
15:55:04 <Nude_Riker> yeah triangle stuff i never quite feel like im lining up right
15:55:10 <bonegar> something about the hip/lowerback/shoulder 
15:55:12 <bonegar> yea same

15:56:44 <registered_mirc> ^
15:56:50 <bonegar> yea im guessing they enjoy bullying people for typos
15:56:59 <bonegar> so that's not gonna work and they'll simply have to eat crow until they can bully again
15:57:25 <scoop_jackson> im not like super into that music for a whole night but i do like ron morrelli 
15:58:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i'd like to see ron morelli

16:02:58 <mikev> all night party is good
16:03:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> need something more upbeat for all night
16:03:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> everyone wants to be all doom and gloom

16:05:36 <mikev> Rezz at Terminal5
16:06:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think my problem is i don't look for new music
16:07:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my tastes end in like 2008?
16:07:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so i don't recognize anyone
16:07:26 <scoop_jackson> well i like house and disco
16:07:32 <scoop_jackson> so i think slightly different track
16:07:41 <scoop_jackson> though related to your stuff
16:07:47 <mikev> dj haram playin 2morrow
16:07:51 <mikev> helena hauff tonight
16:07:59 <registered_mirc> i love bleak warehouse techno but i cant handle as much of it anymore
16:08:05 <scoop_jackson> basically i just watn to go to a dope jams party
16:08:10 <scoop_jackson> or body & soul
16:08:16 <registered_mirc> i need my warehouse techno to have sprays of bright color
16:08:29 <registered_mirc> kangding ray is good for that
16:09:08 <Nude_Riker> i really just do not get techno, probably because i dont have ketamine
16:09:23 <scoop_jackson> even like ur or detroit stuff?
16:09:27 <registered_mirc> what lol
16:09:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i want to travel back in time to 1992
16:09:33 <dreddybajs> techno ftw
16:09:42 <registered_mirc> do you seriously only get music if there is a drug you've done associated
16:09:50 <bonegar> my music tastes shifted into deconstructed ambient stuff and basically crystalized. i'm solely here for the funny and strange sounds in a way that 'trance' as a genre can only pretend to
16:10:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hey registered_mirc i have an appointment on march 15
16:10:14 <bonegar> be...... dunno what happened to that sentence
16:10:15 <Nude_Riker> no, but most people i know who listen to/dj techno do ket while theyre in the club
16:10:15 <registered_mirc> woooo
16:10:31 <registered_mirc> you ought to try some first-hand experience
16:10:54 <scoop_jackson> i have to go to meeting this sucks
16:10:58 <scoop_jackson> i wanna talk 
16:10:59 <bonegar> im not sure i know what ketamine is supposed to, i just think 'k-hole' and people crawing into toilets to take naps
16:11:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's friday, meetings are banned on friday
16:11:08 <bonegar> supposed to do
16:11:10 <bonegar> i am losing words
16:11:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we will be here when you return
16:11:20 <registered_mirc> anyway, techno is cool because repetition does cool shit in the brain
16:11:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have gone dancing plenty of times without a drug or a drink
16:11:25 <Nude_Riker> most techno is unfortunately just kind of boring to me. which is fine, its just not for me
16:11:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> techno does get samey i like heavy bass and fun sounds
16:11:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> hell fuckin yes
16:11:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> new deathhammer
16:11:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i also like ron morelli so
16:11:46 <Nude_Riker> yeah shrimp1989dspinfo 
16:11:53 <NORG> i listen to this song a lot lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcQTrJvT7dA
16:11:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you know  what i really like
16:11:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> acid
16:11:58 <Nude_Riker> acid ftw
16:12:01 <registered_mirc> half of the idea of techno imo is hypnosis
16:12:02 <Nude_Riker> the drug and the music
16:12:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i really wish it was the 90s again
16:12:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> >: (
16:12:11 <registered_mirc> and getting into a hypnotic state with the repetition
16:12:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm going to build a time machine and go dancing
16:12:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> damn the top chef finally pre'd
16:12:18 <bonegar> good sound
16:12:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> about time
16:12:35 <registered_mirc> acid is the thing i dislike most lol
16:12:37 <NORG> top chef

16:24:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my boss has no idea what i look like

16:25:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> when u need a black thrash attack

16:25:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> its one of my fav sounds and theyre one of the best doing it these days
16:25:39 <registered_mirc> thanks for the reccie
16:25:48 <registered_mirc> yeah this is def my kind of shit for sure
16:25:58 <the_tasteful_nerd> i havent jived much w/ the elden ring music which i kinda appreciate
16:26:00 <registered_mirc> kinda reminds me of old voivod
16:26:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> because i can just turn music down and play a record
16:26:22 <registered_mirc> yeah im like weird about listening to music while gaming
16:26:28 <registered_mirc> cos i generally want to have the experience they intended
16:26:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah i usually do that for a while
16:26:37 <eric> It makes sense the ape escape soundtrack would be jungle
16:26:37 <registered_mirc> unless its a game ive played a dozen times
16:26:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol eric
16:26:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> and when i feel like ive gotten the idea i turn music off
16:26:45 <eric> Since that's where they live
16:26:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> true!!!!
16:26:58 <the_tasteful_nerd> one of the most annoying things about the yakuza games is theres no music volume slider
16:27:00 <registered_mirc> OOOOoh ba-na-na
16:27:04 <eric> I also feel that way about game music
16:27:08 <registered_mirc> what the fuck
16:27:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> i half expected elden ring not to have that either
16:27:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> but thankfully, it does
16:27:13 <registered_mirc> no volume slider??
16:27:15 <registered_mirc> that's nuts
16:27:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> nope. 
16:27:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> only audio options u get are like stereo or surround
16:27:32 <registered_mirc> that's kinda rude from a dev perspective
16:27:39 <registered_mirc> lol
16:27:52 <the_tasteful_nerd> and in y7 i guess you can select japanese or english dub
16:28:02 <the_tasteful_nerd> but the english dub is sooooo fuckin bad i turned it off in .5 minutes
16:28:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> apparently david hayter does the voice of the bartender that is your homie in the english dub though
16:28:26 <the_tasteful_nerd> but i didnt check that out
16:28:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i never play games in english
16:28:31 <eric> Unless it's a roguelike or something like vampire survivors or a strategy style game
16:29:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> well i didnt expect it at all, y7 is the first one to have an eng language dub and it's on by default i guess
16:29:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i was watching someone play siren and i was losing my mind at the obviouisly japanese characters talking with shitty british accents
16:29:01 <eric> I got to play the intended way
16:29:16 <eric> That's gnarly
16:29:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when i restarted botw i was really caught off guard by the english va
16:29:33 <eric> It's like turning the wrong audio track on in anime for a second
16:29:37 <the_tasteful_nerd> i wonder if someone has like made a best of
16:29:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah that's how it feels
16:29:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> of he y7 dub

16:30:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> NEARLY 3 HOURS LONG
16:30:11 <eric> Yakuza is kind of a good game to play the dub though
16:30:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my boss called while i was listening to ape escape soundtrack and i couldn't figure out where it was comign from and i was freaking out
16:30:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> no way its so distracting lol

17:03:43 <the_tasteful_nerd> yes
17:04:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> hope this king von isnt as horribly cynical as the last pop smoke
17:05:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't really like american rap but there were a couple cool pop smoke songs
17:05:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> whoever produced the tracks did something fun
17:06:33 <the_tasteful_nerd> american rap
17:06:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i'm sick to death of trap beats
17:07:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> there are a lot of good rappers who do not have beats like that
17:07:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and then the new soundcloud style stuff is also not fun
17:07:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> the people who produced pop smoke initially were just the drill guys from the UK
17:07:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> in fact there is kind of a renaissance of good stuff like that right now
17:07:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i liked uhh
17:07:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> listen to the moor mother and billy woods record imo
17:07:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> with griselda and boldy james and billy woods
17:07:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
17:07:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> .yt ize this is not a drill
17:07:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this
17:09:19 <the_tasteful_nerd> this is kinda cool but it just sorta reminds me of shit from like 2000 when roni size would have method man on a track or we lol
17:09:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's doing the dmx voice over a cool track
17:09:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> .y boldy james bb butcher
17:10:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> as i have said befroe my music tastes end in like 2008
17:10:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> good energy but i think i'd rather hear like flowdan over this
17:10:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> this is probably my favorite hip hop track of the last few years
17:10:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> flowdan ftw
17:10:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i just like the idea of american rappers using tracks like this
17:10:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> it owns that the bug/flowdan are on roadburn fest lineup and are the only real rap adjacent thing on there
17:11:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this bb butcher song
17:11:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't like the flow
17:11:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> fair enough
17:12:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like high energy
17:12:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah you probably wont be into the billy woods thing will rec'd either
17:12:32 <Nude_Riker> the bug and flowdan in 2022 seems odd, i would see them if i could but...
17:12:48 <Nude_Riker> are they gonna be doing 10+ year old stuff or what
17:12:52 <scoop_jackson> theres a new g perico album id probably like that because my taste ends in like 1995
17:13:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l
17:13:18 <Nude_Riker> the most recent things i heard flowdan on he was uhhh just reusing the same bars
17:13:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think ive heard a flowdan thing more recent than this, which was on the hyperdub anniversary comp in... 2014?
17:13:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> .y flowdan ambush
17:13:41 <Nude_Riker> like it could have been a recording of him
17:13:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> this track is an alltimer though
17:13:57 <Nude_Riker> ya
17:14:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> .yt the bug poison dart
17:14:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this is my favorite song he's done
17:14:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> poison dart ftw
17:14:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> adn then iceman
17:14:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> .yt the bug iceman
17:14:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like this one more than skeng
17:14:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> i remember someone in phiz (it might have been toni) told a story about how they saw warrior queen live and she spent most of the set just rubbing her crotch and going "me gwaan ardcore"
17:15:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
17:15:04 <Nude_Riker> lmao
17:15:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hell yeah 
17:15:17 <Nude_Riker> the ninja tune anniversary show with the bug was definitely one of the best things ive ever gone to

17:15:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l
17:15:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> god iceman is such a good song 
17:15:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the bass is so heavy
17:15:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk if youd like this shrimp1989dspinfo but the beats are like more bassy three six mafia type beats 
17:16:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> and there is definitely Energy

17:32:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> congrats
17:32:49 <greatest_gamer> i am the same weight as i was in Fifth Grade
17:32:54 <scoop_jackson> congrats mason
17:33:01 <eric> nice dude
17:33:42 <greatest_gamer> a tremendous symbolic victory to be lighter than i was as a Child
17:33:59 <eric> can you lift your childhood self
17:34:06 <greatest_gamer> depends on the lift but ya!
17:34:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> mason that's really cool
17:34:13 <greatest_gamer> definitely not ohp that's not happening
17:34:28 <eric> even so
17:34:36 <greatest_gamer> but the last time i was regularly lifting i could bench squat and deadlift over my bodyweight
17:34:56 <greatest_gamer> and did other very important symbolic things like did a pullup and then did a pullup directly into a second one witout dropping/stopping
17:35:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> grats mason
17:35:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> you are lighter than me
17:35:13 <greatest_gamer> the last thing i just did that was funny since we're doing a lot of boxing is i just learned to jump rope
17:35:16 <greatest_gamer> i'm really embracing my inner tween
17:35:23 <eric> that rules honestly
17:35:48 <eric> when i first started doing yoga i did it because i was really uncomforatable crossing my legs and sitting on the floor
17:35:54 <greatest_gamer> i told my trainer i want to make a video for his instagram where he gives me the presidential physical fitness test from elementary school and i fucking CRUSH it as a symbolic triumph
17:35:59 <eric> and when i could do that comfortable for the first time it was a real watershed 
17:36:10 <eric> i still tell people how im proioud of myself for it and they dont understand
17:36:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
17:36:16 <greatest_gamer> ya eric i chase that feeling more than any other feeling ive ever felt
17:36:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ya eric i had that experience w yoga and touching my toes for the first time in my life
17:36:23 <greatest_gamer> that feeling of doing something i couldn't do before
17:36:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think id do very well at the presidential physcial fitness test at this time
17:36:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> in particular the mile
17:36:36 <greatest_gamer> i crave and chase that feeling daily
17:36:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i ran a mile for the firtst time when i was like 24 years old
17:36:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> the fastest mile i ever ran was 9 mins
17:36:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> when i was in 5th grade
17:36:54 <eric> oh yeah running is a big one
17:37:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> running sucks
17:37:10 <scoop_jackson> yeah i hate running
17:37:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> i could do a 5:30 mile... on the elliptical in the gym
17:37:14 <eric> running is divisive itc
17:37:20 <eric> its me against the world really
17:37:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> doesnt really count
17:37:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my cardio of choice is bike
17:37:33 <scoop_jackson> at my peak i ran a 620 mile or something like that
17:37:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i do a combo of ride bike and bird look
17:37:39 <eric> bnut its cool as hell to need to run and then being able to and not be out of breath
17:37:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> we're going to get a new exercise bike soon and i will try to start using it
17:37:48 <eric> nice tom
17:37:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because i ride along a canal and there's green herons
17:37:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> its too fuckin hard to ride a bike in brooklyn
17:38:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have a really shitty bike but the tires are deflated and i dont have a pump
17:38:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> i want to get the shifters fixed too because they only work on one side
17:38:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i ahve a road bike my friend gave me in 2011
17:38:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wait mason was there when  i got the bike
17:38:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we were in ohio
17:39:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my bike strat in the summer is wake up at 530 and ride for like 14-18 miles and hten log into work
17:39:32 <eric> thats cool
17:39:41 <eric> i love to do long bike ride
17:40:00 <eric> see parts of town unseen before 
17:40:09 <eric> stop for snack
17:40:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i hit over 20 miles rt for the first time last year
17:40:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my average trip is like 14-16 miles
17:40:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wanna try for 30 this year
17:40:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmao the_tasteful_nerd https://twitter.com/egeapaydiin/status/1499132745749917699
17:41:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i've spent critical months just sitting on my ass feeling sorry for myself so maybe i won't be able to. we'll see
17:41:19 <eric> i reckon you can do it
17:41:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> lmfao tom
17:41:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i had to stop riding earlier i nthe season last year because my leg exploded
17:41:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> youll probably need to work up to it
17:41:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> but you can do it
17:41:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> idk what happened but i did physical therapy for 2 months nad it fixed it
17:41:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think ive ever rode more than like 7 miles on bike and i certainly couldnt do it around here
17:41:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but then it was too cold to ride
17:41:51 <eric> yeesh
17:41:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> its just too fucking dangerous to ride a bike around here
17:41:57 <eric> bodies are fucked up
17:42:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i wouldn't ride in a city
17:42:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there are lots of bike trails aroudn here
17:42:13 <eric> connor does it
17:42:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> last year i ate shit on one of the trails and i still ahve a bruise
17:42:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> just a permanent bruise on my arm
17:42:32 <the_tasteful_nerd> 12:33:43 PM <greatest_gamer> a tremendous symbolic victory to be lighter than i was as a Child
17:42:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> i know lots of people that do but i feel like everyone is one tiny mistake away from getting extremely killed
17:42:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> hell yes brother
17:42:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hit the lip of a bridge and went flying over my handlebars and crashed into the railing
17:42:41 <eric> idk what the vibe is like in new york but i really enjoyed riding in london
17:42:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> the vibe... is bad
17:42:55 <greatest_gamer> thank you my friends your support is important to me
17:43:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> the bike lanes are pretty much completely disregarded and are often parked in
17:43:02 <eric> yeowch
17:43:05 <eric> battlescar
17:43:13 <scoop_jackson> yeah ny is not good for bikes despite how many ppl want to bike there
17:43:16 <greatest_gamer> oh yeah shrimp1989dspinfo you did get that bike in ohio 
17:43:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> the alternate side parking shit in nyc makes it kind of impossible to have good bike lanes
17:43:28 <eric> oh yeah i didnt think of that
17:43:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have a scar on my ankle from a morning ride, i was looking down at my mp3 player nad i ran into a curb and tumbled into the grass
17:43:32 <greatest_gamer> at berea fest
17:43:40 <Nude_Riker> ny seems to be good for 0 types of transit
17:43:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and some guy in a car saw the whole thing
17:43:45 <greatest_gamer> that feels like 100 years ago
17:43:45 <eric> i have a very bad scar on my ankle from cycling
17:43:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> the subway is great actually
17:43:49 <greatest_gamer> like it happened on a different planet lol
17:43:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah it does mason
17:43:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> it is very poorly maintained unfortunately
17:43:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i still ride that bike lol
17:44:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what did you do eric
17:44:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> but it is a great system in its bones
17:44:11 <Nude_Riker> thats what i mean tom, like even the thing that should be good is not good
17:44:22 <eric> when i worked at restaurant i was riding home from work at like1 in the morning
17:44:32 <eric> and while powering up a hill the pedal sheared off the crank
17:44:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> well that has a lot to do with the fact that we spend more on our police than most countries do on their entire army
17:44:41 <eric> and my ankle dug right into the gears
17:44:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh my goodddddd
17:44:47 <greatest_gamer> i tossed out the fixie i bought from hunter when i accepted that i would never take the time to convert it to single speed and it was a neat bike but not a nice one
17:44:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's terrible i hate it
17:44:51 <Nude_Riker> right there are many reasons for this stuff
17:44:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao mason
17:44:54 <eric> resulting in what you might call "a flapper"
17:44:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> aaaaaa
17:45:02 <Nude_Riker> ayyyyy
17:45:03 <Nude_Riker> yi yi
17:45:08 <the_tasteful_nerd> we only have 4 covid patient right now
17:45:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean even despite the poor maintenance the subway is usually very good
17:45:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> its over fplks
17:45:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> covid is gone
17:45:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> and the buses are good too
17:45:21 <eric> covids over baby
17:45:21 <greatest_gamer> i got a lot of use out of it though i really liked playing bike polo unironically 
17:45:26 <greatest_gamer> i FUCKED my shoulder up so bad playing it though
17:45:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> the main problem that the bus has is having to share the road with other cars
17:45:32 <greatest_gamer> id love to play as a more fit human now
17:45:40 <eric> yeah its really funny to me how bad the transit is in la compared to every other city
17:45:42 <the_tasteful_nerd> time to squat
17:45:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i can't wait to ride bike on sunday
17:45:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> i could nver live in LA for mainly that reason
17:45:57 <greatest_gamer> i want to get a mountain bike and make some trails in my forest
17:45:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> couldnt deal with that shit
17:46:02 <Nude_Riker> the bus in la is fine to good
17:46:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> me gwaan ardcore
17:46:04 <greatest_gamer> it would be very fun and easy to do this
17:46:08 <eric> maybe if the weather is nice i will ride my bike to the pizza party
17:46:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> me gwaan ardcore
17:46:09 <Nude_Riker> i took it all the time
17:46:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i considered getting a mounting bike but i will shatter every bone in my body if i do
17:46:27 <greatest_gamer> lol
17:46:28 <eric> ive heard that its very dependant on where you live matt
17:46:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i got nervous after i crashed twice last year
17:46:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> .we 11207
17:46:31 <eric> and where you are going
17:46:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> darksky
17:46:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> darksky phil
17:46:46 <Nude_Riker> it is eric, but for everywhere i wanted to go it was good
17:46:47 <greatest_gamer> yeah uhh the reason i dont is because my boss used to be a big mountain bike guy until he beefed it and fucked up his shoulder bad
17:46:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> its a high of 40 today but its gonna be 70 on sunday
17:46:58 <NORG> lol the biggest wrestling torrent site was hosted in russia
17:46:58 <greatest_gamer> and like multiple surgeries and therapies later he still cant ride a bike
17:47:00 <greatest_gamer> sooooooo
17:47:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> load a shit
17:47:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> awful
17:47:06 <greatest_gamer> seems like a risky activity!
17:47:17 <eric> it is risky
17:47:20 <eric> but its very fun
17:47:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah when i crashed on the bridge and i was bleeding all over i was certain i severely damaged something
17:47:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i just got some gnarly bruises all over
17:47:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> oh yeah i missed this discussion cause i was workin on smething but shrimp1989dspinfo might like some of the higher energy detroit shit 
17:47:35 <greatest_gamer> i would describe what i would do here as more like 'trail riding' than mountain biking
17:47:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> like sada baby
17:47:42 <greatest_gamer> not that much elevation change or like rock formations here
17:47:43 <the_tasteful_nerd> .y sada baby mutumbo
17:47:45 <greatest_gamer> just trees n shit
17:47:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> sada baby ftw
17:47:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> detroit stuff is ftw
17:48:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> detroit gave us detroit techno and electro and some styles of acid
17:48:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ty detroit
17:48:08 <greatest_gamer> shrimp1989dspinfo crosses the street when she hears rap approaching 
17:48:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> nobody does the "gradually getting more angry and shouting at you" shit like sada 
17:48:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i do mason it's true
17:48:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> unless it has a british accent
17:48:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> duke deuce should put something new out
17:48:29 <the_tasteful_nerd> he did last year didnt
17:48:30 <the_tasteful_nerd> he
17:48:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah at the start of the year
17:48:37 <greatest_gamer> fwiw if i was required to do it i would definitely pick shrimp1989dspinfo to knockout game
17:48:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what is knockout game
17:48:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> on one hand its refreshing that he isnt one of these guys who puts out a 30 track mixtape every 2 months
17:48:48 <eric> yeah cruising down a smooth trail is very fun
17:48:55 <greatest_gamer> oh my god danielle how do you not know about that
17:48:56 <the_tasteful_nerd> he's avging about one shit per year
17:48:58 <greatest_gamer> you definitely do
17:48:59 <eric> no need for bumpling down rocks and full suspension and all that
17:49:01 <the_tasteful_nerd> so i'd expect one soon
17:49:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol this sada baby song is so 2006 i love it
17:49:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> the knockout game is the purported game that young Urban teens do in order to gain "street's cred" where they come up and knock out an unsuspecting pedestrian
17:49:34 <greatest_gamer> ya
17:49:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> detroit rap lives outside eras
17:49:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> it literally happened to a guy i know though lol
17:49:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this is making me think about juvenile back that azz up
17:50:01 <greatest_gamer> Homie_in_a_geod: damn that's wild
17:50:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> my friend who lives in c-squat
17:50:10 <greatest_gamer> ok well
17:50:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> he got decked out of nowhere a few years ago
17:50:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> had a really fucked up eye and face for like a month
17:50:49 <greatest_gamer> the c-squat uniform
17:50:57 <eric> getting punched in the head would suck probably
17:51:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i would probably be a great target for knockout game
17:51:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> i'm too menacing for that
17:51:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think its really an organized campaign by Black Hoodlums though
17:51:32 <greatest_gamer> i'd turn your head around so many times it'll pop off like a grape
17:51:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> thanks for ending my suffering
17:51:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> all of the attacks that have been happening to old asian people have been lone people of all races
17:51:54 <eric> id twist your head off your neck like liziqi does a cabbage
17:52:03 <greatest_gamer> it's probably the most meaningful gift i could ever think to give my dearest friend
17:52:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao liziqi ftw
17:52:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> i figure thats probably more or less how the "knockout game" shit was happening before
17:52:39 <greatest_gamer> one day ur gonna be on your bike and im gonna special ops you from the bushes and nod to nobody in particular that what's done, is done.
17:52:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> thank you
17:52:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it would be really easy to kill me i imagine

17:58:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> but also, in a weird way that makes you know you are experiencing a Problem
17:58:28 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah i wouldnt expect a virus to do that unless its just a gag
17:58:29 <eric> im erring on the side of Joke
17:58:44 <greatest_gamer> i'm team eric on this one lmao but i would love to know if that actually just happened randomly
17:58:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like joke virus more than cryptominer virus
17:58:46 <greatest_gamer> and try to determine why
17:58:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> not to say it couldnt but usually you dont wanna overplay your hand when crafting a virus

17:59:21 <greatest_gamer> yeah any piece of malicious software that does something like this is incredibly deprecated like

17:59:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
17:59:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> Ha Ha Ha
17:59:52 <eric> interesting
17:59:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> apparently this is something that could actually happen thanks to dying video card
17:59:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> i need a new swim suit
17:59:59 <greatest_gamer> the_tasteful_nerd: i get a lot of 'meeting mileage' out of repeatedly explaining this concept to people
18:00:11 <greatest_gamer> that actually you wont know anything is happening until they choose to do so
18:00:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/qRSl7vXS/image.png
18:00:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have a couple swimsuits that basically look exactly the same
18:00:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> black one piece
18:00:34 <eric> i guess in text mode windows uses a special gfx driver
18:00:43 <greatest_gamer> eric it definitely does so this makes sense
18:00:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> his happens with a specific family of Nvidia processors dating back to about 2007 that had a design flaw - they overheat and the BGA soldering between the processor and board cracks or otherwise gets damaged. This is just one of the possible failure modes, but it will eventually die in a terminal and rather total fashion.
18:00:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Powar Ma jagema
18:00:53 <greatest_gamer> neat

18:03:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> ideally you will also be wearing a tank top with a pot leaf on it
18:03:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like this swimsuit https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/6vPMMebf/signal-2022-02-19-085542_001.webp

18:11:33 <this_fellow_kermit> does anyone remember the furries on jugde mathis where he says dont forget my internet
18:11:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this is the day i got it checked out
18:11:39 <NORG> Lol that's some good necrosis
18:11:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it took up a big amount of my calf
18:11:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah this_fellow_kermit because you talked about it
18:11:49 <eric> jeeper
18:11:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> yesterday
18:11:54 <this_fellow_kermit> well i was thinking about it
18:11:56 <bonegar> yes everyone remembers the thing you spoke about yesterday
18:12:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have a really gross scar now bonegar
18:12:02 <this_fellow_kermit> well i mean from before yesterday
18:12:03 <eric> i dont
18:12:04 <eric> i missed that
18:12:07 <NORG> i wasn't here, i don't remmeber it at all
18:12:15 <this_fellow_kermit> its like a 10+ year old video
18:12:29 <bonegar> any chance the gross scar is actually a cool scar?
18:12:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> hmm designing my own swim suits might be the play
18:12:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it is cool, it looks like a burn
18:13:08 <this_fellow_kermit> and i watched it again and i cant believe that i never put together before, why the guy who was driving cross country to pick up a 15 year old he met online, might be  so concerned about not leaving his laptop in the car that he was eager to get hold of it even while his skull was cracked open
18:13:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the circle on my leg was drawn by a doctor
18:13:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and he said if the redness spread beyond that circle i needed surgery
18:13:44 <bonegar> thinking about the judge mathis furries all night long lmao
18:13:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i did not have insurance at the time
18:14:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but it was fun watching my skin melt and rot for like... what, three months?
18:14:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> mason how long did i have the hole in my leg
18:14:25 <the_tasteful_nerd> gross
18:14:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> i just got a really good idea for the custom board shorts design greatest_gamer 
18:14:42 <bonegar> did you put vaseline on it
18:14:46 <greatest_gamer> shrimp1989dspinfo: uhhh man like 6 weeks? 8 weeks?
18:14:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no i mostly left it alone
18:14:53 <bonegar> oh
18:14:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it took a long time to heal
18:15:00 <greatest_gamer> it felt like a long fucking time
18:15:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it was black for a very long time
18:15:17 <greatest_gamer> Homie_in_a_geod: Present It.
18:15:18 <bonegar> if you ever get any other terrible flesh wounds putting vaseline on it really helps a ton and reduces scarring, i can confirm this 
18:15:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i will keep this in mind
18:15:35 <bonegar> tip to anyone for future fleshwounds
18:15:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i scar very easily
18:15:54 <NORG> https://twitter.com/CeBeGeBess/status/1499252752605585413
18:15:56 <eric> present it lmao
18:15:56 <NORG> funny
18:15:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> now, this is a work in progress https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/caZDr4Vc/image.png
18:16:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> but
18:16:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think youll get where im going
18:16:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lfnmao
18:16:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ahaha
18:16:17 <bonegar> oof
18:16:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> where's the ring
18:16:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you can't have that without the ring
18:16:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> you can only put the design on one side and then it repeats
18:16:34 <bonegar> gonna get kicked out of the water park for wearing that
18:16:57 <greatest_gamer> that is a good design
18:16:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wonder how much my skin would rot if i got a spider bite now
18:17:18 <bonegar> probably depends on the spider
18:17:19 <greatest_gamer> https://i.gifer.com/KxL5.gif
18:17:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the doctor said that was only his second time in 25 years seeing a brown recluse bite
18:17:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i was blessed
18:17:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> im glad you didnt die like jeff hanneman
18:17:55 <greatest_gamer> gwen stacey over here
18:17:58 <this_fellow_kermit> why did alan bite you
18:17:59 <greatest_gamer> that's spidergirl's name right
18:18:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> these spiders were in my bed
18:18:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> somehow
18:18:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> i would have pulled that quote out from the bot if the bot wasnt fucked up
18:18:11 <bonegar> i never do anything about spiders, which makes me kind of worried they might crawl into my bed at night sometimes, but w/e never been bit
18:18:17 <bonegar> well maybe i have dunno
18:18:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> it was funny when alan got mad about that quote
18:18:22 <bonegar> but never had a gaping necrosis
18:18:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the first time i was bitten i stripped my sheets and thoroughly cleaned my room adn then it happened two more times
18:18:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so idk where they came from
18:18:30 <greatest_gamer> you just upset them
18:18:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> the bot isn't fucked up. 
18:18:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i thought it was a burn because at the time i would get extremely drunk and fall asleep every night in bed wiht my laptop
18:18:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> its fucked up.
18:18:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and the power supply would get wrapped in the sheets and get really hot
18:18:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l
18:18:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> it's "stock"
18:18:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so i assumed it was a power supply burn
18:19:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> this is a good album
18:19:05 <bonegar> i miss getting drunk and passing out. rip.
18:19:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> youd think marissa nadler would get more attention considering how many people make music that is similar to this but worse
18:19:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> and who get huge praise for it
18:19:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but the grossest blisters i've ever had outside of motorcycle tail pipe burn and 500 degree oven door burn formed on my leg
18:19:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> i guess shes too Old to be a critical darling now
18:19:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so i just thought it was that
18:19:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> shes been doing it for too long
18:19:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but no it was poison
18:19:54 <the_tasteful_nerd> and has too many records
18:20:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> i think the last time someone like p4k cared was around when little hells came out
18:20:18 <this_fellow_kermit> marissa nardler
18:20:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> its funny how music criticism incentivizes making less music 
18:20:29 <Nude_Riker> i want to eat a pizza as it is friday but dipping in and out of keto is bad i need to maintain
18:20:31 <this_fellow_kermit> did any metal albums come out this year
18:20:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> mpg and i are having pizza today matt
18:20:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> probably not that you would like
18:20:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> join us
18:20:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's pizza day
18:20:48 <this_fellow_kermit> what ones are there
18:20:51 <Nude_Riker> maybe ill get one of the terrible quest ones
18:20:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> theres wiegedood which i expect youd hate
18:21:01 <this_fellow_kermit> wiegedood
18:21:02 <bonegar> yah matt i feel ya. i'm really worried i'm gonna projectile vomit again if i have beers and food....
18:21:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> well i'm probablyt getting calzone
18:21:06 <bonegar> but damn i want beers n food
18:21:22 <Nude_Riker> im gonna drink white claw surges
18:21:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> calzone with mushroom and spinach
18:21:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> theres a voidceremony ep
18:21:32 <Nude_Riker> which honestly was a bad move to buy even though it was a good value
18:21:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i think you already mentioned that
18:21:38 <this_fellow_kermit> i have that one
18:21:41 <Nude_Riker> because on keto you get drunk faster
18:21:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> deathhammer came out today
18:21:47 <bonegar> i weirdly don't like the hard seltzers
18:21:48 <Nude_Riker> so two of these is 4 drinks
18:21:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> izthmi which i dont think youd like
18:21:54 <bonegar> i probably would have when i was in my early 20s
18:21:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i got extremely hungover the other day off 3 asahi cans
18:22:03 <bonegar> but now i just want 1 big nice beer
18:22:08 <Nude_Riker> the hard seltzers are not good
18:22:10 <Nude_Riker> none of them are
18:22:13 <bonegar> not even wine anymore
18:22:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> what is this the body/OAA album
18:22:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> who is OAA
18:22:18 <the_tasteful_nerd> its a new body album
18:22:19 <the_tasteful_nerd> and i dont know
18:22:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> but its good
18:22:41 <bonegar> i used to be a big wine fan but i'm absolutely retired from wine
18:22:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> spotify has suggested i add zeal & ardor to my 2022 playlist
18:22:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
18:22:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> fuck off
18:23:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i drank 2 bottles of wine in 2 hours once and woke up covered in vomit and now i can't drink wine anymore
18:23:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> i guess OAA is an electronic producer of some sort
18:23:14 <bonegar> lmao yea, shrimp.. that's the danger of wine
18:23:20 <Nude_Riker> i had a bottle of wine last weekend
18:23:23 <bonegar> it's very easy to put away an entire bottle
18:23:26 <Nude_Riker> i wasnt very drunk after
18:23:29 <bonegar> then be like 'hmm is there another bottle?'
18:23:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i was in a Bad Mood and i chugged the first bottle
18:23:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and then finished off the second and went to sleep
18:24:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the only oither time i've thrown up in my sleep was when i had food poisoning as a teen
18:24:13 <Nude_Riker> im gonna drive to the store even though i did that yesterday, and purchase some sliced cheese and deli meats
18:24:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> i thoink theres been at least one sentient ruin release this year so far
18:24:25 <bonegar> bad mood drinking ftl.. even though i'm a very happy drunk and it's a very good fix
18:24:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you should drive to the pizza store and get a pizza
18:24:28 <Nude_Riker> the metallic taste in my mouth is fucking killing me rn
18:24:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk if you like that label the_tasteful_nerd 
18:24:29 <this_fellow_kermit> does anyone know if theres any art of girls being shrunk and put in one of those cat backpacks where they can see outside

18:28:35 <this_fellow_kermit> this wiegedood seems fine
18:28:40 <this_fellow_kermit> i think they repeat themselfs too much
18:28:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> i figured youd think it was too overproduced
18:29:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> .y dayton family f.b.i.

18:32:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> thats what it does
18:32:42 <this_fellow_kermit> better than coffee

18:36:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> ore wa jakku bauaa

18:36:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> tpe plane. The plane
18:36:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah but it's been around for so long and now it's gone
18:36:56 <this_fellow_kermit> why is the wiegedood on spotify but not bdnacrap
18:36:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it won't be the same
18:37:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it was so cool...
18:37:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> iu really liked that the cargo hold was accessed by raising the nose
18:37:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> because the new album is on century media this_fellow_kermit 
18:37:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
18:37:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> idk how sometihng that big can stay aloft
18:37:36 <this_fellow_kermit> yuck
18:37:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> truly an engineering feat
18:37:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> i didnt realize it was until i looked that up just now
18:37:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> damn i didnt realize CM doesnt put stuff on bandcamp
18:38:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> the last 3 records all got released on southern lord but i think that might have just been a distro thing
18:38:14 <this_fellow_kermit> its fail that drakkar got banned from bandcamp
18:38:19 <the_tasteful_nerd> dekkar
18:38:50 <mikev> dekkar reunion at oscar special
18:38:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah its kind of weird the_tasteful_nerd 
18:39:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> like a lot of labels that dont have their own bandcamp pages will at least let bands put the records on their own bandcamp pages
18:39:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3BoKbpOF2E
18:39:20 <this_fellow_kermit> https://invictusproductions666.bandcamp.com/album/of-soil-unearthed
18:39:22 <this_fellow_kermit> i thin, this is good
18:39:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the music playing in this video is really funny
18:39:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> its funny that the only tag on this is Ireland
18:39:58 <this_fellow_kermit> https://transylvaniantapes.bandcamp.com/album/fossilization-he-whose-name-was-long-forgotten?from=footer-cc-a2180138580

18:40:21 <this_fellow_kermit> https://gutlessproductionsasia.bandcamp.com/album/swollen-with-rancid-phlegm-split?from=hp
18:40:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> the recommendeds at the bottom of one of these reminded me that wake are playing tonight
18:40:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i will not be seeing them
18:40:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> because i am going to a different show, that i dont have tickets to
18:41:14 <the_tasteful_nerd> hmm. wake soounds better
18:41:34 <this_fellow_kermit> im pretty sure this is one of those fake bands with a fake origin story but its interesting https://siddhatthagotama.bandcamp.com/album/-
18:41:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> that deathcult ecord is good
18:41:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> well i had planned to see haru nemuri with my friends a long ass time ago (pre pandemic) and the show obviously got pushed a lot of times
18:41:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> and now it is actually happening
18:41:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> if i cant get tickets to this one i will be going to wiki/navy blue instead
18:42:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> my statement stands
18:42:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> wake are like first of 4 on their bill so their set will probably be really short anyway
18:42:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> portrayal of guilt are headlining but ive seen them a lot
18:42:35 <this_fellow_kermit> https://scourgewhip.bandcamp.com/album/nihl-demo
18:42:37 <this_fellow_kermit> really good band name
18:42:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> that is a good name
18:42:55 <this_fellow_kermit> that ones for mason too
18:43:05 <this_fellow_kermit> cause the songs are all lsess than 1 minute long
18:44:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> is the aew ppv this weekend
18:44:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> that for me

18:45:56 <this_fellow_kermit> https://deathprayerrecords.bandcamp.com/track/paralipomena-ii
18:46:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> tony khan is really funny
18:46:10 <this_fellow_kermit> most egregious example of playing screamo and calling it black metal yet seen
18:46:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> when i am not looking at the screen it doesnt sound funny how he's talking but its really funny when you can also see his face
18:47:00 <this_fellow_kermit> cocaine tony
18:47:33 <het> https://i.imgur.com/0xZTtnZ.jpeg

18:52:54 <bonegar> its always so cool when you see a bigmawed person tear into one
18:53:02 <bonegar> they just open up the ol chomper and in it goes
18:53:20 <this_fellow_kermit> i definitely checked out this izthmi before and dismissed it instantly i think
18:53:23 <bonegar> plus they can cool themselves in the summer by just opening their mouth up wide
18:53:23 <eric> precision nibbles

18:54:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when i ate big macs as a teen i would just take them apart
18:54:20 <this_fellow_kermit> i think 'atmospheric black metal' means boring shit but im not sure yet just a suspiscion
18:54:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i would eat top bun+burger patty, then middle bun, then bottom bun+burger patty
18:55:02 <bonegar> atmospheric black metal sounds like something i might like if it was good
18:55:06 <eric> is there post metal with like post rock affections 
18:55:13 <this_fellow_kermit> isnt that all post metal
18:55:21 <bonegar> yes

18:56:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> the stuff that i like often gets labeled atmospheric black metal but i wouldnt say that most stuff with that label is good
18:56:39 <this_fellow_kermit> i dont think i like this album that much but the album art is bad ass
18:56:40 <this_fellow_kermit> https://arasubversor.bandcamp.com/album/vow-of-dominion
18:56:50 <this_fellow_kermit> so i keep listening to it in hope that i will start liking it more
18:57:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> id listen to these now if i wasnt watching the wrestoling
18:58:18 <this_fellow_kermit> a little treat for later
18:58:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> obvious take but pretty crazy that daniels can still go like this at 51
18:59:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> 1:55:08 PM <eric> is there post metal with like post rock affections 
18:59:08 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah theres a ton these days
18:59:11 <this_fellow_kermit> https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2476554592_10.jpg
18:59:17 <this_fellow_kermit> the armor 
18:59:19 <this_fellow_kermit> it is ornstein
18:59:37 <bonegar> my immediate response to seeing that was 'cool darksouls'
19:00:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> post metal usually refers to those instrumental bands like benji mentioned but a lot of black metal has post rock affectations now too
19:00:26 <mikev> lol https://twitter.com/MrMatthewCFB/status/1499588929628127236
19:00:42 <this_fellow_kermit> they call it post black metal
19:00:58 <this_fellow_kermit> an d ist gay as hell
19:01:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> its good.
19:02:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> its funny that russian circles are generally considered post rock but they are definitely heavier than sannhet who are generally considered metal
19:02:03 <bonegar> color commentary guys absolutely destroyed an entire generation of dad brains
19:02:51 <registered_mirc> i thought russian circles were post metal
19:03:03 <registered_mirc> thats how ive always thought of them anyway
19:03:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk i guess they could be called that
19:03:09 <this_fellow_kermit> i was listening to a band the other day and i was like 'hey this singer sounds like the arghoslent guy' and then i looked at the lineup and it had pogrom from arghoslent but NOT doing vocals
19:03:12 <registered_mirc> stuff like isis
19:03:17 <registered_mirc> that whole area
19:03:25 <bonegar> isis-likes
19:03:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think they sort of gotten heavier over time
19:03:40 <this_fellow_kermit> oh right it was Hearse
19:03:45 <this_fellow_kermit> who have the best band picture ever
19:03:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> [flowdan voice] Hearse
19:03:52 <this_fellow_kermit> https://www.metal-archives.com/images/1/7/3/0/17305_photo.jpg
19:04:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> good pic
19:04:13 <this_fellow_kermit> oh it wasnt pogrom it was Gelal Necrosodomy
19:04:24 <this_fellow_kermit> oh wait
19:04:26 <this_fellow_kermit> thats the same guy
19:04:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
19:05:12 <this_fellow_kermit> anyway that hearse album is another good 2022 album and as far as i can tell they arent nazi affiliated other than having a prolific nazi musician in the band

19:09:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> more people should learn how to do this
19:09:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> how hard could it be
19:09:25 <eric> the same could be said about ace of base tbf
19:09:29 <bonegar> im thnkin not too hard if i have the right tools
19:09:29 <registered_mirc> simply get a chemistry degree
19:09:34 <bonegar> chemistry is easy
19:09:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> is there a nazi in ace of base
19:09:40 <registered_mirc> there you go

19:09:59 <bonegar> you get some carbon, you get the other guys to stick to it, make sure the electrons agree, easy 
19:10:06 <this_fellow_kermit> the sign that they saw was a swastika

19:10:45 <eric> true
19:10:47 <this_fellow_kermit> thats not really ironic
19:11:00 <eric> hows that
19:11:03 <this_fellow_kermit> oh wait
19:11:04 <registered_mirc> i want whatever drugs make me stop being pissed off and annoyed at friends
19:11:07 <bonegar> going 'breaking bad' but im just making adderall and have zero hangups because im not a balding white middle aged man
19:11:07 <NORG> my farts are rly stinky right now
19:11:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> well all of the 'aryan' mythology was borrowed from south asian culture stuff
19:11:15 <this_fellow_kermit> nvm i was thinking there was a long tradition of buddhist nazis but i was thinking of hindu nazis
19:11:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what happened mpg
19:11:28 <registered_mirc> gamer brains i think
19:11:30 <registered_mirc> and probably autism

19:11:38 <eric> type
19:11:48 <bonegar> i'll keep saying it but it's time to take the swastika back
19:11:54 <registered_mirc> friend is talking down to me about elden ring and i want to punch his face
19:11:54 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dont want it
19:11:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's annoying

19:12:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> just play the game and have fun
19:12:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> in what way do you mean talking down
19:12:14 <registered_mirc> i really absolutely loathe how this game has made some people behave
19:12:17 <this_fellow_kermit> i think there have been brutal buddhist theocracies
19:12:19 <the_tasteful_nerd> i wouldnt take it too perrsonally, its a video game
19:12:26 <eric> yeah there have been
19:12:30 <bonegar> want me to deal with this bad opinion nerd for you mpg?
19:12:33 <registered_mirc> it's not about the game.
19:12:33 <bonegar> i think i could destroy them
19:12:37 <registered_mirc> it's about how people act
19:12:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> whats he saying
19:12:57 <registered_mirc> i dont want people destroyed i want them to stop talking to me like i have brain damage

19:29:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> they must be using one of the more pungent hops today because it also smells like weed
19:30:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> maybe theyre making weed beer.
19:30:35 <eric> industrial espionage
19:30:39 <bonegar> i remember beer guys telling me that hoppy beer pairs well with weed and makes you higher
19:30:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
19:30:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> that sounds like a lie
19:31:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> hm. thats not true
19:31:10 <bonegar> absolutely, but pliny the elder after roasting a bone is v. pleasant actually. which is what i think they meant to say
19:31:17 <the_tasteful_nerd> it just makes u drunk and high
19:31:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> which rocks
19:31:26 <bonegar> lol ya

19:31:54 <bonegar> pliny is maybe the one west-coast beer i miss
19:31:54 <mikev> its very easy to end up on the ground with the spins if you get too drunk
19:32:13 <eric> getting stoned and having that first morning coffee wahoo
19:32:20 <mikev> lets go
19:32:36 <bonegar> the only way to truly tell if the coffee is good or bad

19:34:30 <mikev> and that i will have to hold my tongue
19:35:42 <Nude_Riker> i liked fallen angels but its definitely not one of my favorites

19:56:30 <eric> theyre being told to
19:56:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah
19:56:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> because it feels like there are actual implications (being nuked)
19:56:40 <Nude_Riker> because an official enemy did it
19:56:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's propaganda bs
19:57:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it is bad that a country is being invaded but the reaction specifically is a result of consent manufacturing

20:08:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we won 5-2 earlier this week
20:08:42 <NORG> was it the rangers who got 2 goals scored on them in 45 seconds yesterday
20:08:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> the isles suck ass this year
20:08:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah NORG but the rangers won that game
20:08:53 <NORG> i saw something like that on the espn crawl this morning
20:09:01 <NORG> oh were they the team that scored the goals
20:09:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> it was 3 goals in like 2 mins 45 seconds lol
20:09:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> no they got them scored on them but they came back
20:09:29 <NORG> it was the islanders. 
20:09:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> they were up 2-0 and then very quickly went down 3-2 because they forgot how to play defense and then put ryan reaves out, who sucks
20:09:37 <NORG> the games must have been similar
20:09:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> and then came back to win 5-3
20:09:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> it was against st louis

20:10:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> st louis started their very quick run of 3 goals about 30 seconds after mike said in here 'thats it im done with this shit'

20:21:06 <this_fellow_kermit> i was listening to the very bad last emperor album and i was thinking its a shame there arent many actually good metal bands taking big swings at making concept albums like that

20:23:55 <this_fellow_kermit> they shouldnt actually do that
20:24:04 <this_fellow_kermit> i just had to exorcise the thought from my brain
20:24:06 <eric> i dont know whats being censored there
20:24:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> it was funny when i listened to half of some horrible russian rap record because it was under Creature on spotify
20:24:11 <the_tasteful_nerd> groat
20:24:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i thought it might be the black metal band creature because they did rap on their last album
20:24:30 <this_fellow_kermit> i heard a black metal song that had rap on it recently
20:24:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> was it creature
20:24:36 <this_fellow_kermit> i forget what it was
20:24:38 <this_fellow_kermit> i guess they call it dungeon rap
20:24:47 <NORG> Thats wu tang clan :P
20:24:50 <this_fellow_kermit> it wasnt creature
20:25:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> 3:24 PM <this_fellow_kermit> i guess they call it dungeon rap
20:25:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> 3:24 PM <NORG> Thats wu tang clan :P
20:25:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> outkast would have been a better joke there.
20:25:27 <NORG> thought about it after. but i like mine better
20:25:37 <the_tasteful_nerd> goodie mob
20:25:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> goodie mob also a good joke which is the same as the outkast joke
20:26:21 <alansmithee_> man imagine the nuclear heat rusev would be able to get now with his original wwe gimmick
20:26:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
20:26:35 <this_fellow_kermit> oh it wasnt black metal it was just some dungeon synth thing i found on the black metal tag (annoying thing dungeon synth artists do)
20:26:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> rusevs original wwe gimmick was really good
20:27:06 <this_fellow_kermit> https://szed388.bandcamp.com/track/die-schwarze-ernte-b-side
20:27:10 <this_fellow_kermit> at like 1:50 there is rapping
20:27:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> it was very funny having them just put up enormous pictures of putin
20:27:16 <alansmithee_> honestly wwe wasted him entirely (same for many people rip cesaro)
20:27:26 <this_fellow_kermit> remember the peste noire rap video
20:27:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> cesaro has had a perfectly decent career there and has probably made a good amount of money so idk if id say hes been wasted
20:27:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> theyve never made a joke of him
20:27:55 <alansmithee_> ehh, i still think he could've been bigger
20:28:04 <NORG> actually tom my joke was major + epic fail

20:28:16 <this_fellow_kermit> rmeember htis
20:28:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> obviously hes a better worker than their top guys but i wouldnt really want to see the program with him as champion
20:28:21 <NORG> coz i was thinking the line "straight out the fuckin dungeons of rap" which is actually ny state of mind and nothing to do with anything i thought at all
20:28:21 <alansmithee_> like he was the dude who got me watching wrestling again right before he signed with wwe or at the same time
20:28:25 <NORG> so i'm going to shoot myself  in my ass hole now
20:28:30 <this_fellow_kermit> idiot
20:28:36 <NORG> Oh shove it!!!

20:28:58 <alansmithee_> i think he could've easily made a good champion but idk
20:29:05 <dreddybajs> i was thinking what the wutang connection was and all i could come up with was odb being in the cell in gravel pit vid
20:29:05 <NORG> Alan who are you most hype to see in AEW?
20:29:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk who is coming in from the roh deal
20:30:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk whos on roh who doesnt already do stuff in aew
20:30:15 <alansmithee_> norg i haven't really watched much aew even though i've ggotten over my aversion to it. i like a lot of the clips and stuff i see here but i also don't know really where to watch
20:30:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh dragon lee is on roh cool
20:30:27 <alansmithee_> i like darby allin tho cause he did an interview thing with jpegmafia
20:30:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> peggy should wrestle
20:30:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> hes fuckin shredded
20:31:02 <alansmithee_> i haven't liked many of the upper card guys that came over from wwe honestly tho (excluding jericho)
20:31:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> and has incredible stamina
20:31:15 <this_fellow_kermit> Martin Sjöstrand
20:31:15 <this_fellow_kermit> 7 months ago
20:31:15 <this_fellow_kermit> I like the gangsta rap influence of this video. And all the half naked muscular guys remind me of Tom of Finland! Keep it up,  you handsome Frenchies! Todelooo!
20:31:43 <alansmithee_> i'm still disappointed i missed him when he came near here :/
20:31:50 <dreddybajs> jon moxley is good i think
20:31:52 <dreddybajs> i like him
20:31:56 <dreddybajs> idc about punk though i think hes boring
20:32:15 <alansmithee_> i liked punk before
20:32:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> danielson is still probably the best worker alive
20:32:35 <alansmithee_> and moxley i haven't really liked since the early shield days 
20:33:14 <alansmithee_> Homie_in_a_geod: i would kinda doubt that but idk enough about wrestling anymore to contradict that immediately
20:33:15 <dreddybajs> oh yeah iu like danielson
20:34:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> hes really fuckin good in aew
20:36:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> he gets to do cool matwork shit that didnt really play in wwe
20:36:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> hes a really good heel promo too
20:37:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> Homeo

20:38:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> every time i use my vacuum sealer/sous vide i wonder why i dont do it more often
20:38:17 <eric> its funny when someones got a big wrestling move and the get the guy in like the grab they do before the big move
20:38:27 <eric> and the guy whos grabbed is like acting all freaked out
20:38:57 <eric> mayube im just imagingin this happening

20:44:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
20:45:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> i was just like "damn why am i so hungry" and i realize ive only eaten like 800 cals today

20:47:40 <Nude_Riker> i think ive probably eaten less than 300 cals 2day
20:47:56 <Nude_Riker> amphetamines and keto mean i aint hungry

20:49:47 <Nude_Riker> i will drink 4 or maybe even 5 surges tonight
20:50:09 <alansmithee_> i've eaten nothing today but i usually just eat once late a giant meal. now i'm trying to eat once late,, a smaller meal!

20:53:06 <eric> managers have no clue
20:53:14 <the_tasteful_nerd> 3:49:49 PM <Nude_Riker> i will drink 4 or maybe even 5 surges tonight
20:53:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> thats too many. be careful friend
20:53:57 <Nude_Riker> we'll see what happens
20:54:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> sounds like a recipe for: Bad Saturday
20:59:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this is a really good calzone
20:59:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i fell down the stairs on my way out
21:00:05 <eric> good thing it waas before you had za in hand
21:00:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it was like a slipping on a banana peel style fall
21:02:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmfao jesus christ
21:02:36 <bonegar> what kinda shoes?
21:02:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> we did a sticker mailing to members and just got invoiced for it and the bill was like 5x what we expected to be paying
21:02:59 <bonegar> da friggen supply chain
21:03:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> and apparently the reason for this is that our merch vendor sent all the stickers out in bubble mailers and mailed them usps first class
21:03:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmfao
21:03:06 <bonegar> lol
21:03:09 <eric> lol
21:03:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> christ they are so stupid
21:03:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> only socks because i don't wear shoes in the house
21:03:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but the stairs are carpeted
21:03:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> very confusing
21:03:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
21:03:30 <eric> extreme danger
21:03:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> why did the vendor make this decision
21:04:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> the merch vendor company is like 5 people total and they are all middle aged midwestern folks
21:04:06 <bonegar> .gis those small goats that fall over
21:04:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> and they are all, to put it kindly, morons
21:04:23 <bonegar> lmao
21:04:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> theres like one guy who knows what hes doing and a bunch of ladies who are absolute idiots
21:04:40 <bonegar> i feel like middle aged midwesterners should understand the USPS maybe more than other places
21:05:03 <bonegar> so yea, i dont think they can get away with being old or from a place that uses mail, a famous legacy system
21:05:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> to give an idea of their typical mode of operating that i have dealt with, they have on many different occasions sent me their monthly inventory report
21:05:27 <bonegar> maybe he's running a harem
21:05:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> but attached the previous months inventory report
21:05:40 <bonegar> 1 guy and 4 dumb broads
21:05:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> because they do not understand how to use their inventory system
21:06:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> they have also contacted me like dozens of times about 'we're trying to send a refund and it won't go through' and they provide me with screenshots that clearly show that the refund has already gone through
21:06:37 <bonegar> lmao
21:06:52 <bonegar> amazing they can do screen shots
21:07:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah honestly
21:07:33 <eric> i like the kind of guy that knows how to do the print screen and paste style screenshot
21:07:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> another time we had to deal with some shit from a customer who was pissed off because he asked for a refund which they did not successfully put through, and then to prove that to him, they sent him a screenshot which had his entire cc number on it
21:07:39 <bonegar> our state's entire dept of education is run by the people you are describing
21:07:49 <bonegar> it's just 'that lady' all the way down and up the chain
21:07:50 <eric> but not about snipping tool style thing
21:08:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> do you guys have a contract with that merch vendor
21:08:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> so you cant do other stuff w/ other vendors
21:08:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think we're locked into one
21:08:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean we regularly purchase stuff from other vendors and have them distro it
21:08:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> sometimes they actually print stuff
21:08:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> oh hm. i guess distro is an issue too
21:08:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think their capabilities are basically limited to shirts and other cloth goods but we sell other stuff through our store
21:08:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> too much calzone
21:09:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this was a mistake
21:09:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> which they warehouse
21:09:19 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah space/distro is something hat would be difficult to bring in house
21:09:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> there was talk at some point about switching vendors but i dont think anything came of it
21:09:27 <eric> too much calzone is a problem one could gladly solve in the future
21:09:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> its hard to find a union merch/distro in the usa
21:09:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wonder if we could link up with shirtkiller lmao
21:09:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
21:09:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> honestly.... maybe?
21:09:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> the street fight guys use a unio shop for their merch
21:09:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm jsut very full now
21:10:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> which one is that
21:10:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i have so much left
21:10:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> im not sure
21:10:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> a small should be smaller
21:10:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think shirtkiller would advertise us directly but i dont see why they couldnt handle our printing/distro operation and web store if we paid for separate hosting or w/e
21:10:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> might have to ask them
21:10:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> it just says on their site
21:10:56 <the_tasteful_nerd> Made from 100% cotton in the USA and printed with union labor. 
21:11:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> holy mountain seems to have a pretty good operation going too
21:11:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://twitter.com/TheyCallMeDSP/status/1499644334466945025
21:12:37 <mikev> lol
21:12:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> but shirt killer is the coliesum guy right, it does seem like doing dsa stuff would align w/ his politics
21:12:51 <mikev> evo psych phil
21:12:56 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol 
21:12:58 <the_tasteful_nerd> philly
21:13:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> people naturally gravitate towards things that go up, not down
21:13:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> he's got a point
21:13:18 <mikev> its true. i love to see number go up
21:13:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> ive been more of a number go down guy as of late
21:13:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> well shirtkiller do the cat magic punks stuff which is all overtly antifa
