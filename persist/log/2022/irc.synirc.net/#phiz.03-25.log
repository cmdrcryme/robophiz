00:35:02 <dreddybajs> pork shoulder ftw
00:35:51 <Melber> if i were really thinking ahead i would've seasoned it tonight and smoked it friday into saturday and just brought it then but 
00:35:56 <Melber> i wasn't thinking ahead
00:37:57 <Melber> lol im watching this ten best tech revolutions in f1 thing and #10 is taking energy from the brakes and feeding it to a battery that can help power the wheels
00:38:11 <Melber> which is something the prius started i think almost a decade beforehand

01:06:43 <dreddybajs> mpg: i guess hes gonna rush for radagons soreseal because thats essentially +40 levels
01:06:49 <mpg> makes sense
01:06:56 <dreddybajs> but that seems like, not in the spirit of sl1 to me

02:13:15 <djack> it’s so surreal that this is coming out when it’s completely meaningless and doesn’t matter but is so quintessentially early-2010’s in flavor and atmosphere that I can’t help feeling fuckin weird about it lmao
02:14:17 <dreddybajs> Merchant said, “Grimes getting her friends in the gaming industry to DDOS the Hipster Runoff blog because Carles reposted some photos of her from Last Nights Party is such a concentrated dose of reprised 00s indie hipster culture it might literally kill me.”
02:14:17 <dreddybajs> lmfao
02:14:23 <dreddybajs> perfect statement djack 
02:14:37 <dreddybajs> this is insanew
02:14:51 <dreddybajs> Reacting to Grimes’ admission, Best Coast’s Bethany Cosentino tweeted, “tbh thank you for your service Claire.” She added, “To be on the receiving end of hipster runoff hate was severely damaging to my mental health. I know y’all thought it was funny but tbh it sucked VERY MUCH.”
02:14:56 <dreddybajs> sorry about your bad band bethany
02:16:04 <dreddybajs> bad reviews = attacking my mental health 
02:18:14 <djack> I remember there was a rumor for a while that Lyle may have been carles but I’m not sure if it was an irony rumor or a sincere rumor
02:18:35 <dreddybajs> yea idk
02:21:24 <djack> God ok I can imagine a scenario where being targeted by HRO would have really sucked though - if stan culture existed in 2013 the way that it exists in 2021, anyone who got clowned on by carles would have then been harassed online by like 3 dozen people extremely bad posters all doing a version of the same joke
02:21:48 <djack> in an attempt to be noticed by carles
02:22:32 <Nude_Riker> yeah and hro was hardly a review site
02:22:40 <Nude_Riker> hi djack :)
02:23:12 <Nude_Riker> this story is truly wild and has been on my mind since seeing it too
02:23:52 <dreddybajs> lol
02:23:53 <het> hey what's up djack 
02:23:59 <het> and yes it's so wild
02:24:08 <dreddybajs> i mean she was already very well known by the time HRO picked up on her
02:24:08 <het> especially like the part where it wasn't just hacking but blackmail?
02:24:12 <dreddybajs> yea
02:24:15 <djack> right!
02:24:24 <dreddybajs> shes just like "i was such a cool hacker!"
02:24:50 <djack> and like, the stories all paint a picture of the hack being the beginning of carles wanting to stop doing hro
02:24:58 <Nude_Riker> yeah
02:25:16 <djack> also hi het hi matt :)
02:27:09 <Nude_Riker> im going to indulge myself and have a shower before bed even though i had one this morning >:)
02:27:32 <djack> Hell yeah
02:27:43 <Nude_Riker> which i get to feel much less guilty about here than when i go back to oregon lol
02:28:07 <Melber> Matt can't wait to move
02:29:06 <djack> West coast mushrooms miss you
02:29:12 <Melber> I'm watching the tragedy of Macbeth and realizing I've never seen an adaptation of Macbeth let alone read it so unlike Hamlet I have no idea what's going on
02:29:27 <Nude_Riker> i miss them too i just wish i could bring the average rainfall differential with me
02:29:36 <Nude_Riker> will miss many east coast mushrooms, especially maitake
02:31:04 <Nude_Riker> oh man Melber you gotta see throne of blood
02:31:27 <Nude_Riker> my fav shakespeare adaptation
02:32:34 <Melber> I guess as I get older I like Shakespeare more but I was never that into him and as such I never read much
02:33:01 <Melber> I read Julius Caesar and Romeo and Juliet and those are the only plays I've ever read in full
02:33:07 <Melber> Of his
02:33:14 <Nude_Riker> i wasnt either tbh
02:34:41 <Melber> I've never read Hamlet in full but I've seen enough adaptations. I have almost 0 knowledge about macbeth
02:35:11 <Melber> Dodging Shakespeare in high school and then getting to a college where they assumed you already knew all of that ftw

12:20:10 <Rusty> good morning. friday morning
12:23:03 <bonegar> how do i do a git pull from github in 2022, i guess it just asks me for a password and username then laughs at me and says it doesn't do that anymore from command line then gives me a weird website about enabling 2factor
12:23:38 <Selfie_Dad> u need to dl some cli bullshit
12:23:44 <Selfie_Dad> .l
12:23:44 <Rusty> yah
12:23:51 <bonegar> seriously? god lmao
12:23:53 <Rusty> there's a key or something? i forget
12:23:56 <Selfie_Dad> let's go
12:24:03 <Rusty> i had to do it in a big hurry the first day i worked from home lol
12:24:04 <bonegar> fucking hate how all this shit is broken for any new user
12:24:46 <Rusty> is it something you're forking/working on? or do you just need the files? 
12:25:03 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i just did it last week so i could put robophiz on there for no good reason
12:25:18 <bonegar> i'm just trying to do a correct pull from a repo i'm supposed to be working on so it can log the pull
12:26:18 <bonegar> and i've only ever downloaded zip file before, or pulled from other things.. idk, it's just this annoying nightmare where a friend has set up a repo and i can't do anything with it because github is a bike-shedding nightmare of weird programmer guy features i'm tripping over to do what i think should be simple things
12:26:34 <Rusty> yeah none of it is intuitive, at all
12:26:41 <Rusty> some people will argue that it is, but they're poisoned
12:27:04 <bonegar> there are so many steps, and the steps change yearly or monthly depending on what is updated
12:27:37 <Rusty> but hey: they changed the 'master' branch to 'main' so we don't need to worry about reparations anymore
12:33:06 <Selfie_Dad> thank you git

12:38:43 <Selfie_Dad> and its very annoying that in their instructions for doing your first push they do not mention at all that you wont be able to login just using your username/pw

13:05:48 <the`shima> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/OiRmbXgk/image_2022-03-25_130545.png
13:05:49 <Selfie_Dad> as it seems the theater now only has a 4:35 screening
13:05:53 <Nude_Riker> damn
13:05:56 <Selfie_Dad> guess its not doing well!
13:06:13 <Selfie_Dad> had to squint to make sure that wasnt will ferrell doing a bit dan
13:06:14 <Nude_Riker> i kept confusing it with deep water for a while
13:06:19 <the`shima> god i was at the wales game last night and it was nuts
13:06:41 <Selfie_Dad> lol they dont even have an evening screening matt
13:06:43 <Selfie_Dad> just 4:35
13:06:45 <Selfie_Dad> thats it

13:07:04 <mikev> what th ehell will
13:07:07 <Selfie_Dad> gotta make room for The Lost City
13:07:10 <mikev> there are 5 screenings at my local theater
13:07:18 <mikev> in this wack ass town
13:07:21 <Selfie_Dad> yeah they had 3 all week
13:07:23 <mandarin_toni> nice dan
13:07:28 <mandarin_toni> who are you playing next
13:07:30 <Selfie_Dad> now its down to 1
13:07:35 <the`shima> scotland or ukraine
13:07:38 <mandarin_toni> lol
13:07:41 <the`shima> and if we win that were in the world cup
13:07:44 <mikev> 11:30 am screening of X for the all the geezers
13:07:53 <the`shima> i am half expecting boris johnson to be like WALES SHOULD GIVE UKRAINE A BY THROUGH THE TOURNAMENT
13:07:53 <mandarin_toni> finland was behind ukraine in the group and since i assume theyre not gonna play we should get their spot
13:07:53 <Selfie_Dad> they JUST stopped showing the spiderman movie
13:07:59 <Selfie_Dad> and they still have a showing of sing 2
13:08:27 <Selfie_Dad> there are also 3 screenings of Jujutsu Kaisen 0
13:08:30 <mikev> what wonders i have to show you
13:08:31 <mikev> https://i.gyazo.com/73c676ab205362e31386d72def31c169.png
13:08:36 <Selfie_Dad> if that tells you anything about the demo here
13:09:13 <mikev> 3 screenings of dubbed jjk and only 1 subbed
13:09:13 <Selfie_Dad> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/rPV9KQ9p/image.png
13:09:26 <mikev> how many screens does your theater have
13:09:45 <the`shima> the best thing about the wales game toni was that the fans have adapted this welsh folk song over the past year or so. basically some welsh folk singer has been performing at events for 40 years and nobody sings along or anything and suddenly its become a thing the whole stadium gets into
13:09:51 <Selfie_Dad> i dunno
13:09:52 <mikev> i need to get out of bed and go to the gym
13:09:54 <Selfie_Dad> like 10-12
13:09:58 <the`shima> so they had him perform the game
13:09:58 <mikev> so i can then drive down to the border for weed
13:10:05 <Selfie_Dad> and one of them is THE CUBE
13:10:06 <the`shima> hes 80 years old and was crying his eyes out it rules
13:10:08 <the`shima> https://twitter.com/tristandross/status/1507305488001736704
13:10:15 <Selfie_Dad> the large format screen for new block buster
13:10:27 <Nude_Riker> i wonder if i have any eye drops around, i dont think so unfortunately
13:11:00 <mandarin_toni> cool dan
13:11:35 <Selfie_Dad> i could see the bat man movie but actuall probably not since they moved the afternoon screening to 1:10 instead of 1
13:11:44 <Selfie_Dad> and a movie that long the extra 10 min makes all the difference
13:12:13 <mandarin_toni> cool if not quite raja casablanca chants level https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geH2XbD2Dd4
13:12:50 <mandarin_toni> people should go see the new michael bay masterpiece ambulance as translated by me
13:13:06 <the`shima> the lyrics to that song rule btw lol
13:13:07 <Selfie_Dad> its not in theater
13:13:14 <mikev> lol i forgot about that movie
13:13:43 <the`shima> https://lyricstranslate.com/en/yma-o-hyd-still-here.html
13:14:00 <Selfie_Dad> lol damn they made a sonic the hedgehog sequel so quick huh
13:14:05 <Selfie_Dad> in theaters in like 2 weeks
13:14:10 <Selfie_Dad> i had no idea
13:14:11 <Selfie_Dad> lol
13:14:22 <the`shima> i tell you what i dislike about going to football matches now though toni
13:14:31 <the`shima> i can deal with drunk fans but my god the amount of people who are clearled coked up
13:14:40 <the`shima> makes me legit uncomfortable
13:14:59 <Selfie_Dad> upcoming movies for the next month or so looks pretty dire
13:14:59 <mikev> lol
13:15:08 <Selfie_Dad> except for the northman
13:15:15 <Rusty> sniffin the yayo and watchin some footie
13:15:17 <mikev> guess it's only a problem when you're in a well-lit area
13:15:34 <Selfie_Dad> maybe that meta nic cage movie will be ok but im not expecting it to be
13:15:36 <the`shima> the line for the toilet at half time was legit crazy
13:15:38 <the`shima> like the cubible
13:15:44 <mandarin_toni> i havent been to a match with attendance + 1500 for years
13:15:59 <mandarin_toni> the womens world cup in 19 was the last time and people behave well at those
13:16:06 <Rusty> .y vindaloo fat les
13:16:10 <the`shima> its just weird how it doesnt get acknowledged
13:16:17 <Selfie_Dad> .l
13:16:17 <Rusty> i dated an English girl and she showed me this song. it's the one thing i know about football
13:16:28 <the`shima> like theres lots of "whats going on at  football matches? fans are losing their heads. hooliganism is coming back into the game"
13:16:39 <Selfie_Dad> lol theyre remaking firestarter
13:16:47 <mandarin_toni> im an old man who doesnt know anything but my impression is that coke still isnt much of a thing here compared to britain
13:16:50 <the`shima> and its like "yeah, guys are drinking from 9am in the morning and are still out in the evening partying. they're not fucking just drinking"
13:17:02 <Selfie_Dad> new alex garland movie
13:17:09 <Selfie_Dad> man i wanna go see movie in the theater
13:17:15 <Selfie_Dad> but theyre not making it easy
13:17:20 <the`shima> i think its just like what cocaine use has become here thats weird
13:17:32 <mikev> e's avin a sniff
13:17:37 <the`shima> like theres guys in their 50s going out and doing lines and they're sons are buying it for them
13:17:42 <mikev> lol
13:17:49 <Selfie_Dad> epic
13:17:50 <mandarin_toni> i remember at uni youd have like fairly normal 19yo girls who always had coke with them at the pub and that seemed outlandish to me
13:17:51 <mandarin_toni> its speed over here
13:17:55 <mikev> british father/son relationships have always seemed weird to me
13:18:03 <Selfie_Dad> lol i keep forgetting about baz luhrmann elvis movie
13:18:05 <mandarin_toni> the speed phreak
13:18:07 <Selfie_Dad> i bet that will be a fuckin mess
13:18:08 <mikev> when i was in amsterdam all the sex tourists were british guys + their dads
13:18:20 <the`shima> back in my hometown theres a bunch of guys who were "normal"  but seem to have become cocaine fiends who ahng out with their sons
13:18:22 <the`shima> its very very odd
13:20:53 <Selfie_Dad> that sounds cool
13:21:09 <mandarin_toni> i personally woildnt do coke with my dad i think
13:22:21 <the`shima> counting down the days ollie offers to get a bag in with will
13:23:47 <mikev> lol
13:25:03 <mandarin_toni> i put up a giant map of mumbai on my bedroom wall
13:25:52 <Nude_Riker> i wouldnt do sex tourism with my dad personally
13:26:11 <Selfie_Dad> that would be cool
13:26:11 <Nude_Riker> probably also not coke, well, he wouldnt do coke, i would
13:26:30 <Selfie_Dad> the biggest barrier to me doing coke is the acquisition i guess
13:26:57 <wild_ape-style_creature> if you have adderall there's no point in doing coke imo
13:27:24 <wild_ape-style_creature> mandatory good ally week is in the middle of summer right before the 4th of july
13:27:32 <Nude_Riker> i remember one time in college my dad and i took a weekend trip to the coast and i brought a joint with me like yeah im gonna smoke weed with my dad and we're going to bond and i finally worked myself up to ask him to smoke with me and he just was very confused and said no and like 5 minutes of awkward "i dont care if you do it, its fine"
13:27:39 <wild_ape-style_creature> not letting people go on vacation for performative bullshit ftw
13:27:55 <the`shima> ollie gonna be like "hey dad do you say we get a bag and watch Cars 2"
13:28:00 <Nude_Riker> lol
13:28:13 <Selfie_Dad> how many times do i have to say this. we do not watch cars 2 in this household
13:28:19 <Selfie_Dad> 1 or 3 ONLY
13:28:26 <the`shima> whats wrong with cars 2
13:28:28 <wild_ape-style_creature> my stepdad and all his friends have been smoking weed a lot
13:28:49 <Selfie_Dad> its an obnoxious vehicle for larry the cable guy mostly
13:28:53 <wild_ape-style_creature> they're all growing it and smoking the weed they grow nad they're having a blast
13:29:03 <mandarin_toni> <wild_ape-style_creature> mandatory good ally week <<< what
13:29:05 <the`shima> does he like any "old" movies
13:29:12 <the`shima> like things from your childhood or older
13:29:22 <the`shima> i dont mean does he watch criterion movies or wahtever
13:30:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> at work there's a whole week of diversity stuff and we have to attend seminars about like mental health and why my company isn't racist but everything else is
13:30:25 <mpg> lol
13:30:41 <wild_ape-style_creature> last year it was in october but this year it's right before america's birthday
13:30:47 <wild_ape-style_creature> that's double punishment
13:30:47 <mpg> [laying on the couch like homer simpson] everyone is racist but me
13:30:55 <wild_ape-style_creature> i got out of it last year by going to see hockey
13:31:03 <wild_ape-style_creature> i gotta figure out how to avoid it this year
13:31:33 <wild_ape-style_creature> they spend like
13:31:45 <wild_ape-style_creature> millions on this crap talking about Equity And Action but they underpay employees
13:31:57 <wild_ape-style_creature> pretty cool waste of time
13:32:10 <mandarin_toni> cool'
13:32:15 <Nude_Riker> its so sick how much money and time gets wasted on that stuff
13:32:15 <Selfie_Dad> no i mean
13:32:39 <mpg> love to perform
13:32:46 <Selfie_Dad> its funny how 3d animation is so pervasive these days that it poisons children against traditional animation
13:32:58 <Nude_Riker> that sucks
13:33:08 <Selfie_Dad> windsor has watched a couple of older disney movies with him
13:33:23 <Selfie_Dad> hes still not at the age where he will sit for a full movie most of the time
13:33:43 <Selfie_Dad> and its a harder sell if it doesnt have songs
13:33:43 <wild_ape-style_creature> Nude_Riker my roommate just bought me a mattgame

13:39:04 <scoop_jackson> how will matt get killed by mushrooms
13:39:07 <mpg> matt you need to start composing music now so you can go full john cage
13:39:11 <Nude_Riker> also pretty hard scoop_jackson 
13:39:37 <Nude_Riker> i need to crack open that fancy john cage mycological expedition thing i bought last year
13:39:44 <mpg> im sure youve seen it but theres a john cage docu called, i have nothing to say and im saying it, where he picks mushrooms and records it
13:39:57 <mpg> among other things
13:40:05 <the`shima> herzog listening to one of matts arguments on a tape about how he prefers the national park because people shouldnt listen to music in parks - "julie... you must never listen to this. i think you should throw it away"
13:40:14 <Nude_Riker> i downloaded it but havent watched it, ive just read some essays and stuff from him about it
13:40:17 <mandarin_toni> lol

13:42:21 <mpg> lol
13:42:47 <mpg> its like 'the uk'
13:42:47 <wild_ape-style_creature> i guess it's only appropriate for cold war 2
13:44:32 <scoop_jackson> hes a putin plant if hes calling it the ukraine report him to the fbi
13:46:54 <mpg> I let a baby bird nest in my hair for 84 days (theguardian.com)

13:47:53 <mpg> i was just gonna say
13:47:57 <mpg> he wants to be doing ted talks
13:48:15 <mpg> havent even heard it and ive no doubt in my mind
13:48:44 <scoop_jackson> i mean if i wree the head of a big organization i would definitely make it mandatory that people listen to my rants
13:48:50 <scoop_jackson> but once a month should be fine
13:48:55 <scoop_jackson> for like 20 minutes
13:48:59 <mpg> i would make people listen to me play guitar instead
13:49:02 <mpg> how funny would that be
13:49:27 <mpg> since im the boss you have to listen to me play music now
13:49:54 <wild_ape-style_creature> here's a sample of this shit where he's talking about fake phishing emails https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/dsWgUOC2/vmware-view_G4kkkFcXKw.mp4

14:16:35 <wild_ape-style_creature> do you think you'll ever rewire the basement
14:16:46 <greatest_gamer> hue, sonos, apple
14:16:47 <Selfie_Dad> yeah if we have it finished
14:17:02 <Selfie_Dad> but thats a project for another time
14:17:03 <greatest_gamer> those are my kids names cause i don’t have kids
14:17:09 <Selfie_Dad> that would be if i had another kid i guess
14:17:15 <Selfie_Dad> and then we need another bedroom
14:17:19 <Selfie_Dad> we'd finish off half the basement
14:17:43 <Selfie_Dad> but i'd need to pay to have the foundation assessed too to make sure the minor amount of water ingress we have when it rains is taken care of
14:17:45 <Selfie_Dad> so it'd be expensive
14:18:24 <Selfie_Dad> mason did you see my new office set up lol
14:18:39 <greatest_gamer> lol no
14:18:42 <Selfie_Dad> the iron dungeon and my work zone have merged
14:18:58 <greatest_gamer> savage

14:19:54 <Selfie_Dad> im slowly cleaning it up
14:20:12 <Selfie_Dad> man i was so psyched to get the nice flooring and the shipping cost just completely shut me down
14:20:32 <greatest_gamer> gym flooring or like normal flooring
14:20:41 <Selfie_Dad> gym flooring
14:20:48 <greatest_gamer> ah
14:20:49 <Selfie_Dad> 8mm rubber tile
14:21:16 <Selfie_Dad> this stuff https://www.rubberflooringinc.com/interlocking-tile/8mm-strong-rubber-tile.html
14:21:25 <greatest_gamer> i wonder if you can find an industrial supplier for that locally and then just cut it yrself
14:21:43 <Selfie_Dad> im just gonna get horse stall mats from tractor supply
14:21:53 <Selfie_Dad> wont be quite as nice but it will get the job done
14:22:01 <greatest_gamer> that’s the name of your space so it makes sense
14:22:04 <greatest_gamer> The Horse Stall
14:22:16 <Selfie_Dad> ya cause im a stud
14:22:21 <Selfie_Dad> i was like ready to drop 500 bucks on the tile but then they hit me w/ the 274 dollar shipping fee
14:22:24 <greatest_gamer> no cause i can see the studs.
14:22:27 <Selfie_Dad> and i said 'nevermind'
14:22:40 <Selfie_Dad> new monitor come 2day
14:22:45 <greatest_gamer> nice
14:22:56 <Selfie_Dad> i wish i had known i was not going to buy the tile before i bought the monitor
14:23:03 <Selfie_Dad> cause i would have gotten a nicer one lol
14:23:03 <greatest_gamer> i beat yakuza 3 last nite, good game
14:23:11 <greatest_gamer> i have a week to plat before ps5 comes
14:23:14 <greatest_gamer> light weight baby
14:23:25 <Selfie_Dad> y3 is good, but also the worst yakuza game imo i think
14:23:44 <greatest_gamer> some really good english voiceover
14:24:11 <greatest_gamer> in the ending cutscene when mine has richardson on the ledge and he’s just in the background going SHIT…. GET AWAY FROM ME… LEAVE ME ALONE
14:24:27 <greatest_gamer> it really affected the weight of the scene imo
14:24:38 <Selfie_Dad> lol ya
14:24:39 <Selfie_Dad> hahaha
14:24:43 <Selfie_Dad> i almost forgot about that
14:24:58 <Selfie_Dad> in y7 they full english dub lol
14:25:10 <Selfie_Dad> and david hayter does the voice of this bartender guy
14:25:16 <greatest_gamer> lmao
14:25:30 <greatest_gamer> i want to replay y0 so michelle can learn about majima
14:26:23 <greatest_gamer> in y3 when he saves u by busting in with a giant pink dump truck with cheetah print seats
14:26:29 <Selfie_Dad> lol yeah
14:26:34 <greatest_gamer> majima #1 forever always
14:26:39 <Selfie_Dad> i wonder what it must have felt like to not have played y0 first
14:26:43 <Selfie_Dad> and then playing it
14:26:47 <Selfie_Dad> and going 'what the...'
14:26:55 <Selfie_Dad> https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/utility-rubber-mat-black-4-ft-x-3-ft-x--frac12-in
14:27:03 <Selfie_Dad> i wonder how many of these i can fit in my lil ass car
14:27:30 <greatest_gamer> i got to play it first so i only know majima as fully jokerfied and based
14:28:17 <Selfie_Dad> a sweet cabaret club manager gone rogue
14:28:46 <greatest_gamer> he was really good at managing that club
14:29:32 <greatest_gamer> i haven’t looked at plat for y3 im gonna assume the annoying thing is haruka request

15:04:40 <Selfie_Dad> this logitech flow thing is kinda cool
15:16:59 <scoop_jackson> must be true, you are the second person ive seen chat something along those lines
15:17:43 <scoop_jackson> "Its really dumb the things that my brain thinks feel futuristic: Google lens translate? Super futuristic! Logitech Flow allowing me to use the same mouse between a laptop and my desktop, including copy and pasting? Super futuristic!"
15:18:43 <Selfie_Dad> i would never say something like that
15:18:46 <Selfie_Dad> bit hyperbolic
15:19:15 <Selfie_Dad> i want my new monitor to arrive
15:28:45 <Selfie_Dad> .l
15:28:52 <Selfie_Dad> damn this record is real good

15:36:39 <Selfie_Dad> my friend sent me this
15:37:47 <HellaBrad> recursion is always in style
15:40:06 <Selfie_Dad> i think she sent it to me because her husband once foisted a hat that just said "hats.com" on it
15:40:18 <Selfie_Dad> because he couldnt stand to have that in his house anymore
15:40:33 <Selfie_Dad> and i would show up wearing it every once in a great while
15:41:14 <HellaBrad> maybe its because i just never wear hats but i always enjoy every variation of the hat-on-a-hat gag
15:41:36 <HellaBrad> never played tf2
15:41:40 <HellaBrad> was never desensitized
15:42:34 <HellaBrad> i have a job interview today and i hate practicing for them how is everyone else's morning

15:47:20 <scoop_jackson> gl w/ the interview
15:47:33 <HellaBrad> thank you
15:53:07 <Selfie_Dad> .l
15:53:16 <Selfie_Dad> interviews are rough
15:55:27 <HellaBrad> normally im pretty good with them but they called me at 5pm yesterday and asked me to come in this morning, im just feeling a little pressure
15:56:01 <scoop_jackson> is it gonna be very technical?
15:56:41 <HellaBrad> not at all i think, just admin stuff for a local pharmacy, should be simple enough
15:57:00 <Selfie_Dad> yeah but anything like that can be anxiety inducing
15:57:05 <Selfie_Dad> esp if ur put on the spot
15:58:59 <HellaBrad> yeah im gonna exercise and take a long shower and make some tea, just try to clear my head

16:33:09 <mpg> still is
16:33:23 <Selfie_Dad> yeah im kinda glad i didnt go for 32

16:35:53 <Selfie_Dad> lol
16:36:38 <bonegar> yea i had to do a lot of weird windows scaling for my new monitor, but i think they did enough updates that things dont look insane anymore
16:39:32 <Selfie_Dad> windows text has always looked woefully bad compared to macos
16:39:38 <Selfie_Dad> its way better than it used to be ofc
16:40:23 <mpg> yeah some apps still look like shit when scaled
16:40:31 <mpg> reaktor looks miserable
16:41:20 <mpg> most are fine tho
16:41:47 <mpg> i dont think windows fonts will ever be good

16:57:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> 12:48 PM <Selfie_Dad> how do bands like that come out of nowhere and are seemingly big from the jump
16:57:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> play around locally a lot and get seen by industry people, ideally
16:57:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> or, Know People, and then start a band
16:58:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> for them i think it is the former
16:58:03 <mpg> usually its the latter
16:58:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
16:58:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> some bands get seen by the right people right away and occasionally those bands are actually good
16:59:00 <mpg> like luca ciramusti's black metal project, while it's decent, only got attention because he's in semi-known local bands and is a music writer for one of the major papers here
16:59:16 <mpg> he's definitely a scene guy
16:59:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> although the impetus for pushing them is always 'person from label or agency Sees Money Here'
16:59:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> but sometimes thse bands do not suck
16:59:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> black midi is a good example of this
17:00:10 <mpg> i only remember black midi because of their name
17:00:15 <mpg> no idea what they sound like at all
17:00:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> weird noisy indie rock
17:00:25 <mpg> probably not actual black midi tho

18:30:08 <wild_ape-style_creature> Rusty are you here
18:30:20 <Rusty> i am indeed what's up

18:30:53 <wild_ape-style_creature> ty
18:30:55 <Rusty> hell yeah
18:32:05 <wild_ape-style_creature> crazy that this stuff is 75% but somehow still mild
18:32:19 <Rusty> i haven't had them in ages cuz i haven't been back to Cambridge or Manhattan (or uh, Walpole NH apparently also)
18:32:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> i ordered it online
18:33:11 <dreddybajs> i dont really get like... do the soldiers get paid 
18:33:27 <eric> in elden ?
18:33:30 <dreddybajs> yeah
18:33:40 <wild_ape-style_creature> lmao
18:33:40 <Rusty> i need to try their chocolates, i've only had the drinkable version really
18:33:45 <Rusty> lol
18:33:51 <eric> i think its like uh medieval times or whatever
18:33:58 <dreddybajs> time to go spend my salary at the local tavern, oops its full of skeletons again
18:34:29 <eric> they have a king or lord or whatever who feeds them and gives them place to live
18:34:40 <wild_ape-style_creature> well i bought the grenada chocolate bar and the peru chocolate bar and they're both good
18:34:46 <wild_ape-style_creature> i also got chocolate covered marzipan
18:34:50 <wild_ape-style_creature> i really like that
18:34:54 <dreddybajs> i guess we do see economic activity with the miners
18:34:58 <eric> yeah
18:35:04 <dreddybajs> crystal-based economy
18:35:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> my options are limited, otherwise i would have tried some of the fancier chocolates
18:36:25 <eric> https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/154064
18:36:49 <bonegar> lol
18:37:52 <wild_ape-style_creature> lol
18:40:16 <Selfie_Dad> chocolate ftw
18:40:18 <Selfie_Dad> id like some good choc
18:40:33 <wild_ape-style_creature> https://www.burdickchocolate.com/
18:40:38 <wild_ape-style_creature> this is what we're talking about
18:42:20 <Rusty> the hot chocolate is ftw especially. basically drinking a thick-ass barely-a-liquid
18:45:43 <Rusty> it makes me feel like the women in 90s yogurt commercials. sinful, indulgent
18:46:08 <wild_ape-style_creature> rofl
18:46:52 <ajj> lmao
18:46:52 <Selfie_Dad> welp this hdmi splitter i bought is not working in the way i had hoped

18:47:17 <bonegar> ui had som,e problem,s wuith m,uine before ui couild get uit to worjk
18:47:53 <Selfie_Dad> well i was hoping i could use it to output macbook video to monitor and audio to sound bar
18:47:59 <Selfie_Dad> but doesnt seem to work that way
18:49:03 <Selfie_Dad> soundbar doesnt show up as a valid source for audio out
18:49:10 <Selfie_Dad> monitor does but, it doesnt have speakers lol
18:49:14 <bonegar> wouild uit be throuigh the tv?
18:49:27 <Selfie_Dad> theres no tv involved here thats the issue
18:49:40 <Selfie_Dad> if i was using a tv i could just plug the bar into the tv vi hdmi arc
18:50:30 <mpg> i wish my mom's chocolate shop was still open, but it was too expensive to have a brick and mortar store
18:51:30 <Selfie_Dad> yeah it seems like if you have a candy shop in this day and age its because you're independently wealtjy and dont need it to be super profitable to stay open
18:52:15 <Rusty> .y r kelly chocolate factory
18:52:17 <dreddybajs> what if youre 50 cent
18:52:18 <Rusty> i used to love this song
18:52:25 <Rusty> as a list of chocolate items being sung in a song
18:52:42 <mpg> she even opened a second shop in the downtown area that didn't do very well, despite the fact it was right next to a flower shop
18:52:44 <greatest_gamer> time to make the donuts https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/NqGobt9l/IMG_3035.PNG

18:53:51 <mpg> nice will
18:53:55 <dreddybajs> nice
18:54:17 <Selfie_Dad> time to try: the ring of eld 
18:54:19 <Selfie_Dad> on this
18:54:23 <mpg> one day i hope to own a house i can do fun stuff to
18:54:27 <bonegar> so y]oui jkuist need auiduio ouit from, the lappy] to souind bar?
18:54:28 <Selfie_Dad> soon i will never leave the basement
18:54:28 <Selfie_Dad> lol
18:54:33 <mpg> before that i must fulfill my highrise dream
18:54:42 <Selfie_Dad> well yes bonegar but the soundbar only has hdmi in
18:54:49 <Selfie_Dad> it's designed for an hdmi arc setup
18:55:23 <Selfie_Dad> i am trying to get use out of it outside of the intended use case
18:56:32 <greatest_gamer> mpg is joining japanese noise rock band high rise
18:56:45 <mpg> haha
18:56:48 <Selfie_Dad> its not the hugest deal because i can just airplay the audio to the bar
18:57:05 <greatest_gamer> airplay is really good
18:57:06 <Selfie_Dad> and because theyre on the same gigE switch it seems like theres no out of sync for dialog
18:57:09 <dreddybajs> nice
18:57:09 <mpg> i thought you were a stickler for audio quality
18:57:10 <greatest_gamer> like you’d think it would be bad
18:57:12 <Rusty> have there been any arrested development/melt banana crossover shirts where it says Freeze Banana?
18:57:12 <greatest_gamer> but it’s good
18:57:22 <Selfie_Dad> airplay 2 is quite good yes
18:57:32 <mpg> i would like to see the data on airplay audio quality vs bluetooth
18:57:40 <greatest_gamer> it’s all bad afaik
18:57:41 <Selfie_Dad> well it's going to be better
18:57:48 <mpg> well why though
18:57:49 <greatest_gamer> you gotta put crystals on a suspended tube amp
18:57:50 <Selfie_Dad> wifi has more bandwidth
18:57:52 <Selfie_Dad> than bluetooth
18:57:59 <Selfie_Dad> and ethernet even more
18:58:02 <mpg> crystals i can understand
18:58:27 <Selfie_Dad> bluetooth is capped at a certain bitrate due to bandwidth restrictions
18:58:34 <mpg> going to start demanding a/b/x stests
18:58:36 <greatest_gamer> keep honking im encoding at 128
18:58:51 <Selfie_Dad> bluetooth is great for convenience but its definitely limited from a quality standpoint
18:58:54 <mpg> remember when those got banned from the audiophile conversation
18:58:55 <Selfie_Dad> vs audio over network
18:59:08 <greatest_gamer> ya mpg cause nobody knew what it meant to do that
18:59:10 <Selfie_Dad> like sonos has lossless radio
18:59:23 <mpg> and also because there is not way any of those people could tell the difference
18:59:39 <Selfie_Dad> and i think probably you could do lossless via tidal if you sub to that
18:59:43 <greatest_gamer> i mostly remember them typically not being functional double blind tests
18:59:53 <greatest_gamer> especially with people trying to tell the difference in encoding lmaooooo
19:00:05 <mpg> ive actually have been considering tidal soley on the efforts they make to pay artists
19:00:07 <Selfie_Dad> i think the limiting factor is far more liekly to be your source file than the speaker/bandwidth
19:00:17 <Rusty> codec bleck
19:00:22 <greatest_gamer> it’s actually our ruined ears from living in the din of capitalism
19:00:34 <Selfie_Dad> well yeah
19:00:49 <Selfie_Dad> i really wish there was a spotify tier i cold pay for that would make all of my plays pay out more to te artist
19:00:54 <Selfie_Dad> i'd absolutely pony up for that
19:00:55 <mpg> i simply just dont believe anyone else
19:00:56 <greatest_gamer> mine are ruined from that and also from using camel filters as earplugs
19:01:07 <mpg> and that's why i have genelec audio monitors lol
19:01:31 <Selfie_Dad> i mean airplay is not perhaps the ideal setup for doing actual like audio work
19:01:35 <greatest_gamer> bandcamp should have a thing integrated with spotify where they get paid more if you own the album
19:01:36 <mpg> although the difference between these and the gamer speakers i had before are like insane
19:01:45 <Selfie_Dad> but if you're just watching shit
19:01:46 <mpg> greatest_gamer: that is actually a good idea
19:01:54 <Selfie_Dad> or listening to music from a streaming service
19:01:57 <greatest_gamer> mpg thank you i am thoughtful and wise
19:02:00 <mpg> lol
19:02:02 <mpg> and humble
19:02:12 <Selfie_Dad> the limiter is the source and/or the speaker itself ot the transport
19:02:21 <greatest_gamer> humility is not self-care.
19:02:38 <mpg> swingin dick is for sure
19:02:47 <mpg> big ol' self care
