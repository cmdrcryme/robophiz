00:20:14 <Selfie_Dad> do any good monitors support hdmi arc
00:30:20 <Selfie_Dad> i guess not
00:30:57 <ajj> i dont think theres any 
00:31:09 <ajj> saw someone reccomend an hdmi splitter though
00:31:13 <scoop_jackson> http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/advance-praise-from-famed-revolutionary-tariq-ali-of-verso-books/
00:51:45 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i dont feel like an hdmi splitter is gonna give me a desired result
00:54:56 <dreddybajs> what's the use case Selfie_Dad ?
00:55:23 <Selfie_Dad> having a computer plug into monitor and have sound out of soundbar
00:55:36 <Selfie_Dad> sounds like only tvs will let you do this
00:59:17 <dreddybajs> hmm yeah no idea
01:01:27 <Selfie_Dad> i could just get a cheap 4k tv probably
01:01:50 <bonegar> hwhat are you trying to do?
01:02:31 <bonegar> hdmi out will do sound to a tv

01:15:48 <Selfie_Dad> i know it will do it for a tv
01:16:00 <Selfie_Dad> i was looking at monitor
01:16:27 <Selfie_Dad> to passthru sound to soundbar via hdmi arc like a tv
01:16:37 <Selfie_Dad> but i guess none of them to it
01:18:05 <Selfie_Dad> monitor at smaller sizes will have better image quality than tv

15:03:58 <mpg> tarp
15:04:12 <Selfie_Dad> lol mpg
15:04:17 <mpg> trap got watered down like right in 2012ish i want to say
15:04:18 <Selfie_Dad> that picture but unironically
15:04:31 <mpg> when dubstep went out of style and all those flat brim hats started making fake trap
15:04:41 <Selfie_Dad> yeah as soon as cracker trap became a thing
15:05:07 <mpg> lol cracker trap
15:05:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> here are all of the available hiphop subgenres (or 'styles') on discogs (pt 1)

15:05:31 <Selfie_Dad> lmao
15:05:44 <Selfie_Dad> how you not gonna have drill
15:05:52 <Selfie_Dad> when its been a thing for like a decade+ now
15:05:57 <the`shima> Melber i think it will be a ferrari v red bull fight
15:06:01 <mpg> that list was written by whites
15:06:05 <Selfie_Dad> and has like 4 or 5 distinct subgenres
15:06:06 <the`shima> which i'm happy with. i like both of those guys
15:06:19 <mpg> memphis junts
15:06:25 <the`shima> i dont buy the "mercedes have an amazing car they just need to unlock performance"
15:06:28 <Selfie_Dad> well maybe not subgenres but regional flavors
15:06:32 <mpg> yeah
15:06:44 <Melber> i didnt read enough about the new regulations but mercedes just seemed SLOW there
15:06:52 <the`shima> have you seen the car
15:06:59 <Selfie_Dad> i am loving my new command center
15:07:01 <Melber> also lol haas got more points this race than i think all last season total
15:07:09 <Melber> the`shima: aside from watching the bahrain highlights no
15:07:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> Selfie_Dad: i mean it's 10 year anniversary of this record so if this is first wave drill then yeah
15:07:14 <Selfie_Dad> but i gotta figure out how to adjust my screens
15:07:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> id reckon there was qualifying drill for a couple years prior to that at least too
15:07:33 <the`shima> the mercedes has a "no side pod" philosophy
15:07:38 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i mean
15:07:44 <Melber> i should take a look at all the cars this year
15:07:48 <Selfie_Dad> keef himself had plenty of output before finally rich
15:07:49 <the`shima> this is the ferrari https://www.formula1.com/content/dam/fom-website/manual/Misc/2022manual/WinterFebruary/f175front.jpg
15:07:51 <Melber> i did 0 research preseason
15:08:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> right Selfie_Dad 
15:08:05 <Melber> yeah the ferrari looked beautiful
15:08:07 <mpg> at the bday party yesterday we were talking about how bone had beef with 3six and my friend, i think correctly, said 'i got a lot of love for bone but i give credit to lord infamous for that style of rapping'
15:08:16 <the`shima> this is the mercedes https://e0.365dm.com/22/03/2048x1152/skysports-mercedes-w13-car_5700909.jpg
15:08:36 <the`shima> they were bigging it up as a big loophole they found and that it'd be worth a second a lap when they showed it
15:09:11 <Melber> the difference in the wings alone there is huge
15:09:13 <the`shima> but then ferrari and haas said "yeah we looked at that concept and decided it had some advantages but sucekd in most areas", teams went quiet about protesting it, and the car looked like shit to handle
15:09:23 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i think its obvious that they took that rhythm and cadence from 3 6
15:09:37 <the`shima> i think they might have gone down the wrong concept basically
15:09:48 <Selfie_Dad> but they obviously were a bit innovative by making it sing songy which is now the predominant form of rapping in the culture
15:09:54 <mpg> yeah totally
15:10:02 <the`shima> you also cant vary that design. ferrari can better tailor the car shape, as can red bull. if you pack it like mercedes theres not rallly much else you cna do lol
15:10:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wonder who gets to add genre tags to discogs
15:10:11 <mpg> twista was also innovating that style in his own way
15:10:13 <Selfie_Dad> me
15:10:13 <the`shima> im so glad haas did well
15:10:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> probably like. 2 ultra power users
15:10:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wonder if theres a Primus tag
15:10:29 <mpg> man discogs people suck a fuck
15:10:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> that is true
15:10:37 <Selfie_Dad> yeah twistas flow was a little different he didnt do so many triplets but they were obviously there
15:10:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> except me. i'm cool
15:10:46 <the`shima> i am so f1 technical pilled lol
15:10:55 <mpg> if youve ever looked up removing your real name from credits, they are absolutely not having any of that shit
15:11:00 <mpg> threads about it
15:11:12 <mpg> Selfie_Dad: yeah he was just super fast
15:11:13 <mpg> and drummy
15:11:20 <Homie_in_a_geod>  
15:11:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> 11:08 AM <mpg> at the bday party yesterday we were talking about how bone had beef with 3six and my friend, i think correctly, said 'i got a lot of love for bone but i give credit to lord infamous for that style of rapping'
15:11:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> this is very true
15:11:32 -!- ajj [~ajj4@633AA473:F4D53CDF:6F2E248D:IP] has joined #phiz
15:11:33 <mpg> twista was actually doing tons of polyrhythmic stuff
15:11:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i get to link my favorite song ever as an example of this
15:12:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf6WT6syDmA#t=2m55s mpg please listen to this whole lord infamous verse
15:12:30 <Selfie_Dad> hmm whats a good mouse wiggle software
15:12:36 <Selfie_Dad> i need to see if i can install one on my work pc
15:12:46 <Selfie_Dad> yeah twista is technically unfuckwitable
15:12:46 <mpg> i just heard of one called wiggler
15:12:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> especially the part where he starts singing
15:13:02 <Selfie_Dad> that song ftw
15:13:12 <Selfie_Dad> im mad they took some of the kingpin skiny pimp stuff off spot
15:13:30 <mpg> damn that could be a bone verse
15:13:40 <Melber> the`shima: daniel riccardo is looking like poison lol
15:13:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> its probably my favorite single verse ever
15:13:47 <mpg> i think they were influencing each other being that this was 96
15:13:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh for sure
15:13:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> Selfie_Dad: i saw a video that was a joint interview with mike skinner and danny brown and mike skinner was saying something about twista and danny brown was like 'nah i didn't like that shit, that was like guinness book of world records rap'
15:14:11 <mpg> its so funny how on that level people dont want to admit they get influenced by their peers
15:14:13 <the`shima> i dunno whats happened to him
15:14:16 <Selfie_Dad> lmao
15:14:30 <the`shima> the mclaren was dogshit on the weekend. apparently they had to tell their drivers to get off the racing line on straights cause the brakes would overheat
15:14:43 <the`shima> they got a bunch of temp fixes on the car but it looked ok in barcelona so idk
15:14:55 <the`shima> i think danny ric/vettel are probably at risk of walking out mid seaso
15:15:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think the most technically skilled rapper of all time who also consistently sounded good was mystikal
15:15:01 <Selfie_Dad> heres a sort of early version of that stuff
15:15:03 <Selfie_Dad> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzzwb8p8D4k
15:15:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> and #2 was busta
15:15:09 <Selfie_Dad> this is 1990 i believe
15:15:18 <the`shima> theres like 3/4 young drivers who are all ready to jump in an f1 car too so theese guys gotta be careful lol
15:15:19 <mpg> oh yeah busta
15:15:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> .y yall aint ready yet
15:15:30 <Selfie_Dad> jay-z is a punchline these days but this track is insae
15:15:37 <Selfie_Dad> and i think this predates all the twista stuff
15:15:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> yall aint ready yet is one of the most ferocious fucking tracks ever
15:15:54 <mpg> Homie_in_a_geod: oh man now im thinking about
15:15:56 <Selfie_Dad> i think sometimes rakim or big daddy kane would do this stuff too
15:16:00 <Selfie_Dad> listen to this jaz song
15:16:02 <mpg> daddy mack and mack daddy
15:16:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> unfortunate about him being a rapist
15:16:11 <mpg> wiggitywiggitywiggitywiggitywack
15:16:16 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i think that stuff came directly from this song mpg
15:16:21 <Selfie_Dad> listen to the jaz song
15:16:23 <mpg> that's very interesting
15:16:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> if i were mystikal i would simply not have been a rapist
15:16:39 <Selfie_Dad> and tell me jermaine dupri didnt straight up jack that for kris krross
15:16:53 <mpg> yeah that's gotta be true
15:17:04 <Selfie_Dad> lmao look how goofy jay-z is in this
15:17:13 <Selfie_Dad> insane that this is one of the richest guys ever now
15:17:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> you should listen to this mystikal track mpg
15:17:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> if you never have
15:17:24 <mpg> i think jay-z is a fuckin nerd probably
15:17:28 <mpg> like always has been
15:17:31 <mpg> now he's just rich
15:17:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> actually, this entire album
15:17:42 <the`shima> remember when he sampled the alan parsons project
15:18:11 <Selfie_Dad> oh you know who else did this stuff a bunch 
15:18:13 <Selfie_Dad> is percee p
15:18:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> i remember the first time i heard make em say uhhh and it got to mystikals verse and i was like hold on what the FUCK
15:18:19 <the`shima> maybe jay z is a black nerd
15:18:21 <mpg> when you have enough money you can dress a type of way and fool everyone into believing that you aren't a total nerd
15:18:21 <Selfie_Dad> yeah
15:18:23 <Selfie_Dad> its fuckin wild
15:18:28 <the`shima> like morpheus
15:18:31 <Selfie_Dad> he fuckin spazzes out
15:18:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i incorrectly, because i was watching on mtv and i miscounted the features, thought that the guy doing that was silkk the shocker
15:19:16 <mpg> i got nothin to say cos i thought his name was slick the shocker for like 10 years
15:19:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> so when my friends would talk about rap, which i hated, but i wanted to participate and not be an asshole, i would say 'i dont usually like rap but silkk the shocker is so good'
15:19:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> as it turned out; silkk the shocker was not so good
15:19:31 <mpg> lol
15:19:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> and his verse on make em say uhh is maybe the worst verse on any major hip hop single of all time
15:19:49 <mpg> i love " i don't usually like X, but..."
15:20:00 <mpg> pwease no shamey
15:20:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah that was very much me as a kid
15:20:08 <mpg> i said it plenty too
15:20:22 <mpg> especially about rap
15:20:32 <Selfie_Dad> thats funny because X is what got me back into rap
15:20:35 <Selfie_Dad> (dmx)
15:20:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> i hated rap and pop but i had some token rap and pop picks that i liked
15:20:38 <mpg> lmfao will
15:20:50 <mpg> X did indeed give it to ya
15:21:12 <Selfie_Dad> i dabbled with the rap is crap stuff for a little while even though i liked it when i was younger
15:21:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> i liked triumph by wu tang but it took me years to actually go further into wu tang than that
15:21:24 <Selfie_Dad> but then its dark and hell is hot came out and it was undeniable
15:21:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> the first rapper i heard on tv and was like seriously into was missy elliott
15:21:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> missy ftw
15:21:44 <Selfie_Dad> and also ruff ryders vol 1
15:21:48 <mpg> Selfie_Dad: i resonated with dmx because it was dark and i was already way into metal so i was like damn this is nasty i love it
15:22:03 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i think that was part of what hooked me about it
15:22:10 <Selfie_Dad> damn this is DARK
15:22:16 <Selfie_Dad> and mean
15:22:21 <mpg> i got blood on my hands and no remose, i got blood on my dick because i fucked a corpse
15:22:28 <Selfie_Dad> also, he has one of the coolest voices ever
15:22:37 <Selfie_Dad> once in a generation voice
15:22:55 <mpg> BARACK??
15:23:01 <Selfie_Dad> ruff ryders vol 1 and dj clue the professional were very formative records for me
15:23:10 <scoop_jackson> YOU USED TO RAP LIKE THE FU SCHNICKENS
15:23:10 <Selfie_Dad> .y m.o.p no love
15:23:23 <Selfie_Dad> was hooked on m.o.p from the second i heard this song
15:23:33 <Selfie_Dad> i think that was also the first place i heard canibus and big pun
15:23:51 <mpg> ill be the first to admit that while i like a lot of rap i really did not go that deep. it didnt take much to get me what i wanted out of it
15:24:12 <Selfie_Dad> and the boot camp clik song gave me love of buckshot and sean price
15:24:26 <Selfie_Dad> many of my fav artists i can trace back to that one cd
15:25:06 <Selfie_Dad> also those funk flex commercial mixtapes
15:25:12 <scoop_jackson> i hope this is in the thug rap section
15:25:17 <scoop_jackson> .y cnn thug paradise
15:25:41 <Selfie_Dad> i went from listening to a bunch of nu metal to pretty much exclusively rap by 1999
15:25:49 <scoop_jackson> first rappers i liked were mc hammer and kriss kross
15:25:55 <Selfie_Dad> and then didnt listen to basically any guitar music at all until like 2005
15:26:06 <Selfie_Dad> when i started getting bck into metal again
15:26:25 <Selfie_Dad> which is pretty good because rock music and quite a bit of metal was pretty bad during those years
15:26:50 <Selfie_Dad> like even the canonical death and black metal bands were releasing fairly bad records during that time
15:27:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
15:27:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> that time period everyone had really fuckin terrible production
15:27:57 <Selfie_Dad> yeah
15:28:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> and there wasnt really anyoing doing cool bedroom black metal stuff
15:28:16 <Selfie_Dad> i think probably if you went back and rerecorded those records they would be more warmly received
15:28:18 <Selfie_Dad> these days
15:28:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> unless you count like... judas iscariot
15:28:23 <Selfie_Dad> a lot of em anyway
15:28:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> probably
15:28:37 <Selfie_Dad> when was like the first xasthur and leviathan stuff
15:28:42 <Selfie_Dad> i found that boring when i first heard it
15:28:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> it was also kind of a weird period because like
15:28:45 <Selfie_Dad> probably would now
15:28:46 <Selfie_Dad> too
15:29:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> i feel like most of the guys In Metal were older dudes who were either still around from the first wave or were influenced directly mostly by like slayer and metallica, and then i think there was a significant gap where less people were getting into and learning to play metal
15:29:47 <Selfie_Dad> yeah
15:29:51 <Selfie_Dad> that makes sense
15:30:16 <Selfie_Dad> i think once the internet became more ubiquitous you got a new wave of people able to be influenced by metal of every generation
15:30:28 <Selfie_Dad> rather than stuff that was handed down to you or on the ozzfest circuit or w/e
15:30:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> gap between when good early thrash was being actively made and fairly popular and the time when people were able to learn about cool underground shit from the internet
15:30:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> right
15:31:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> i feel like most late 20s through 30s dudes making black metal now were very much in the same place as me where they liked that ozzfest circuit shit in their teens and then got into cooler and deeper shit online
15:31:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> found out about mayhem and burzum when they were like 14-20
15:32:18 <scoop_jackson> i had a lot of rap blinders when i was younger but it was more like nas is better than jay-z and you would be a fool to argue otherwise and southern rap has some good stuff like ugk but is inferior
15:32:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> quit hatin the south
15:32:32 <Selfie_Dad> yeah the older guys who had done like tape trading and shit were still lurking in some corners of the internet ready to pass on their arcane knowledge via condescension
15:32:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah lol
15:32:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> also, via racism
15:32:59 <Selfie_Dad> indeed
15:33:09 <Selfie_Dad> a very important component of the whole thing tbqh
15:33:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> it was definitely primarily neo nazis keeping black metal alive throughout the 2nd half of the 90s
15:33:32 <Selfie_Dad> yeah id say so
15:33:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> im glad the course has corrected there
15:33:46 <mpg> mostly...
15:33:48 <Selfie_Dad> its funny how cloistered the politics of all those scenes used to be
15:34:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah mpg im not saying there arent lots of neo nazis making/into black metal now but
15:34:07 <Selfie_Dad> like if you're left leaning you have to play grindcore. no two ways around it
15:34:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think the balance has very much swung in the other direction at this point
15:34:25 <Selfie_Dad> ya
15:34:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> most black metal bands i like now are overtly commies
15:34:41 <mpg> is that true?
15:34:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah for sure
15:35:13 <mpg> thinkin about like
15:35:14 <mpg> watain
15:35:17 <bonegar> keep 👏 politics 👏 out 👏 of 👏 black 👏 metal
15:35:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> well im not super into watain lol
15:35:36 <mpg> even my favorite, emperor, has ties to shitty stuf
15:35:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah i mean their drummer killed a gay guy Just Cause
15:35:55 <mpg> because he was gay
15:36:10 <mpg> also fuckin mortiis being in a band called zyklon-b
15:36:28 <mpg> that's a kick in the dick for me
15:36:35 <Selfie_Dad> i think both of those bands are from generations previous to the current one
15:36:39 <Selfie_Dad> and also only one is still active
15:36:42 <mpg> yeah
15:36:54 <mpg> emperor is... 3rd wave?
15:36:57 <mpg> 2nd wave?
15:36:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> everyone who was around in metal in the early 00s had some fuckin power electronics side project where they coopted nazi imagery because they wanted to be edgy as hell and didnt really see it as a Real thing
15:37:25 <mpg> yeah
15:37:28 <Selfie_Dad> 2nd wave firmly
15:37:50 <Selfie_Dad> i don t even know that there's waves after that unless u wanna consider the rise of usbm as its own distinct wave
15:37:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> watain were around before a lot of the bands i like now and people who were around in the mid 00s (because it was mostly neo nazis keeping the scene alive) probably played with or were on a label with neo nazis at some point whether or not they had those sympathies
15:38:49 <mpg> depending on who you talk to, that could be an unforgivable offense
15:38:58 <Selfie_Dad> watain are from at least the era before bands realized tht theatrics dont necessarily need to be wedded to transgression all the time
15:39:45 <mpg> one thing i saw recently w/r/t noise was someone saying "i dont think occult imagery is good because it has ties to hate"
15:39:49 <mpg> that really got me tilted
15:40:03 <Selfie_Dad> lol
15:40:22 <Selfie_Dad> yeah thats just part and parcel of the all-or-nothing approach people take to evaluating art these days
15:40:26 <Selfie_Dad> frustrating but what can you do
15:40:37 <mpg> dismiss it smugly
15:41:04 <mpg> actually i dont do that, i just ignore it most of the time because that's not the kind of shit i will engage with
15:41:42 <Selfie_Dad> yeah thats just banging your head against a brick wall
15:41:55 <mpg> like ok, do we need to talk about the crusades again
15:41:59 <Selfie_Dad> like the old saying on my grandfathers sign in his office said
15:42:09 <Selfie_Dad> never try to teach a pig to sing, it wastes your time and annoys the pig
15:42:14 <mpg> lol
15:43:44 <Selfie_Dad> wheres wild_ape-style_creature i need to know what mouse wiggle software she uses
15:43:44 <Selfie_Dad> lol
15:45:05 <wild_ape-style_creature> https://caffeine.software.informer.com/
15:45:21 <Selfie_Dad> oh lol cool i used to use this on my mac
15:45:26 <wild_ape-style_creature> it's perfect
15:45:26 <Selfie_Dad> didnt know they made it for windows
15:45:28 <wild_ape-style_creature> ya
15:45:38 <mpg> caffeine doesn't work for mac anymore :(
15:45:47 <mpg> well, it does, but we use teams
15:45:57 <mpg> and teams looks at mouse movement
15:46:20 <mpg> i think that might also be true for windows. the project architect was complaining about it
15:46:24 <Selfie_Dad> oh hmm this is asking me for my email for download link. no thanks
15:46:31 <mpg> just use a fake
15:46:32 <wild_ape-style_creature> wait does teams really
15:46:37 <mpg> yeah
15:46:41 <wild_ape-style_creature> hang on i can just upload mine to dropbox
15:46:45 <wild_ape-style_creature> give me a sec
15:46:47 <mpg> https://temp-mail.org/en/
15:46:57 <mpg> or yeah, drop box
15:47:01 <Selfie_Dad> nah i got a thing
15:47:06 <Selfie_Dad> i found their real site
15:47:42 <wild_ape-style_creature> sorry i just searched and grabbed the first link
15:47:44 <wild_ape-style_creature> i should have checked
15:47:46 <wild_ape-style_creature> i FUCKED UP
15:48:14 <Selfie_Dad> its ok i have google skills
15:48:38 <wild_ape-style_creature> i just got out of a two hour meeting so
15:48:47 <Selfie_Dad> theres some app called wiggler thats free
15:48:49 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm done thinking for the day
15:48:52 <Selfie_Dad> but u need to use the ms store
15:48:52 <Selfie_Dad> lol
15:48:55 <wild_ape-style_creature> ew
15:48:59 <mpg> i think thats what my cowork uses will
15:49:00 <mpg> wiggler
15:49:04 <Selfie_Dad> which is obv blocked by policy
15:49:16 <mpg> whitehouse - wiggle like a fucking mouse
15:49:17 <bonegar> ms store lol, god i have avoided their app platform for so long, dreading the day they make that mandatory
15:49:41 <mpg> you should try using chocolatey
15:49:51 <mpg> i think you can use it to get around ms store stuff
15:50:05 <mpg> its command line shit tho
15:50:16 <mpg> i love it tho, totally rocks
15:50:17 <Selfie_Dad> yeah maybe i think there are quicker ways to satisfy my need
15:50:27 <Selfie_Dad> i just dont want imprivata to lock my screen after 15 min
15:50:54 <bonegar> imprivata is a helluva name lol
15:51:06 <Selfie_Dad> not my name!
15:51:53 <Rusty> had another disgruntled-chat with the other dev. are two-person unions a thing in tech(/in general)? or is it better just to go into a meeting with a list of demands and no representation when a company is this small
15:51:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> HAW HAW HAW
15:51:59 <bonegar> https://www.imprivata.com/sites/imprivata/files/inline-images/complexity-wheel-transparent.png
15:52:12 <Selfie_Dad> lmao theres another one called Move Mouse that is only available via ms store
15:52:15 <bonegar> looking at this and nodding 'yeah. definitely.'
15:52:21 <Selfie_Dad> why do people exclusively put their stuff on ms store
15:52:23 <Selfie_Dad> who uses that
15:52:23 <bonegar> thick client
15:52:42 <bonegar> people who live and work in redmond and their parents
15:52:43 <mpg> Rusty: well, the general attitude i've encountered mostly is that tech jobs are abundant so if you aren't happy you can look elsewhere
15:52:53 <mpg> rather than try to wrench on some bullshit wherever you are
15:52:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> i just hit a random record on my discogs and theres 1 copy of silkworm - blueblood for sale and its being sold for... $200
15:52:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
15:53:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> no one has ever bought it for more than 40 on here
15:53:05 <Rusty> i think we both already are, lol. but it'd be nice to make things work at this place if possible
15:53:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> pretty ambitious there homie
15:53:24 <mpg> yeah i mean if you want to fight, then fight
15:53:33 <mpg> but i have never found it to be worth it
15:53:35 <bonegar> im the work flow-line
15:53:59 <mpg> or maybe you ask and they just say ok and you have encountered the best case scenario
15:54:08 <Rusty> i think it'll be more worth it from a personal-pride standpoint, like "hey here's my worth!" whether or not they agree 
15:54:31 <ajj> <mpg> Rusty: well, the general attitude i've encountered mostly is that tech jobs are abundant so if you aren't happy you can look elsewhere 
15:54:34 <mpg> sure, but you can do that asking for more money from someone willing to give it to you
15:54:39 <mpg> that's what i did
15:54:46 <ajj> agreed, my computer science roomie has jumped to like 4 different jobs at this point in the past 3 years
15:54:52 <ajj> each time getting a pretty sizeable pay bump
15:54:56 <mpg> cos i knew my current place was not going to make it easy and i dont have time to haggle
15:54:58 <bonegar> pride is a sin i think, im not sure i understand why though
15:54:59 <Rusty> true! maybe part of me is still nervous about not being qualified enough despite working here 8mos and doing beyond-my-paygrade shit lol
15:55:17 <bonegar> maybe for reasons like this
15:55:20 <mpg> i mean, i did beyond my paygrade shit for years
15:55:42 <mpg> one thing that is true is no matter what nobody can remove raw experience so
15:55:48 <mpg> you win in thar regard no matter what
15:55:52 <ajj> yeah
15:55:54 <Rusty> oh tru
15:55:59 <ajj> even getting 8 months of experience is rly good
15:56:03 <Rusty> mostly it's a lack of confidence in this company / its promises so far
15:56:06 <mpg> i also like
15:56:18 <Selfie_Dad> .l
15:56:20 <mpg> i have stayed at every job for at least 1 year
15:56:28 <mpg> so i would say, give it a year as it is
15:56:32 <mpg> then figure it out after
15:56:44 <ajj> Rusty: my roomie just left the small company he was working for very similar reasons
15:56:47 <Selfie_Dad> yeah thats a good amount of time to figure out where things are headed or not as the case may be
15:56:59 <ajj> he knew to get out because like, 3 people at his small company had left in the past 2 months
15:58:32 <Rusty> there's a lot of vague talk of "hey you two, get [product] ready for market so we can get you guys the good paychecks!" and i'm like that is not how it works friend. you're lowballing your only two engineers and not hiring anybody else on (or even getting us work laptops..? if you can't afford that i have big concerns about our budget)
15:58:52 <ajj> ahh yeah
15:58:56 <bonegar> yikes
15:59:17 <Rusty> and when we brought salary stuff up in attempts to negotiate we were given "well, WE don't even take a paycheck! and [our son/daughter who also work here] only get $XX,XXX" which like, why are you telling me all this?
15:59:24 <Rusty> family businesses: never again 
15:59:50 <ajj> yeah not getting paid your worth can really do a number on you regardless of what the objective total of that is
15:59:51 <Rusty> they drive Range Rovers here, so whatever they DO get paychecks from is clearly ok
16:00:08 <Rusty> yeah. i'm not mad about the salary itself, it's the salary PLUS other weird manipulative shit
16:00:09 <mpg> Rusty: yeah. put in a year then start looking elsewhere
16:00:19 <mpg> just 4 more months my dude
16:00:31 <mpg> are you going to drown within 4 months?
16:00:33 <Rusty> true true. it'd take me that long to interview somewhere with much success anyway i bet
16:00:46 <ajj> yeah i think thinking of it as a year-long internship and not some place you'll be trapped forever will help a lot
16:00:48 <Rusty> naw. i'm trying to be REALLY objective too, about if i'm just being a brat or if it's all justified ire
16:00:50 <ajj> its just a stepping stone to get you to a real job
16:01:05 <bonegar> leasing a rangerover to the company and writing it off or w/e 
16:01:21 <mpg> like dude, you are still a junior dev too, don't sweat it too much, it's part of the learning of the business
16:01:31 <mpg> which you will learn is often pretty fucked up
16:01:39 <Rusty> they make a lot of "this is a flat organization! there's no real boss!" claims but when there was a boil water notice, the execs got Fiji and we got Nestle. it signals more than they think
16:01:41 <Rusty> oh true haha.
16:01:46 <Rusty> i expect this career to be a mess for a while
16:01:49 <Rusty> if not always
16:02:00 <mpg> [me looking back on 20 years] it's fine
16:02:03 <ajj> lol
16:02:22 <Rusty> ice cube voice HERE'S what they think of you (cheap bottled water)
16:02:35 <ajj> rofl
16:02:38 <mpg> lol
16:02:59 <mpg> walking into a job interview and heading directly for the kitchen
16:03:07 <mpg> UGH no berry la croix?? walk out immediately
16:04:00 <mpg> man when i think back about even the worst jobs ive had, at the end of the day i still got to fuck around on a computer for money
16:04:21 <mpg> pretty tight
16:05:28 <Rusty> true also
16:05:32 <Rusty> blessings to be counted
16:06:07 <mpg> the actual worst jobs ive had were retail
16:06:25 <Rusty> yeah i'm miles past where i was at other jobs by default, contentment wise
16:07:03 <mpg> god i would be such a wreck if i had to work sales for commission ever again
16:07:50 <bonegar> my worst job was probably the first one i had, working at a dairy queen lol... my worst adult job... fixing databases for mailers for a drunk asshole small business tyrant type
16:08:35 <Selfie_Dad> i dl something called 'LeoMoon Sessionguard'
16:08:39 <Rusty> i'm kinda lucky in that my shittier jobs were at least interesting. one hour photo technician / pizza delivery driver let me have glimpses into lots of different people's lives
16:08:41 <Selfie_Dad> and so far it appears to be working
16:09:10 <mpg> lol
16:09:16 <mpg> LeoMoon, SagRising
16:09:22 <bonegar> i did UPS holiday temp work once, and that was easily the funnest job i ever had, just riding around in the snow and carrying boxes to doors
16:09:40 <Selfie_Dad> my first job was for a hybrid video rental/internet cafe store
16:09:45 <mpg> Rusty: yeah, pizza delivery was mildly entertaining
16:09:47 <Rusty> oh shit. i wanna go there
16:09:49 <bonegar> going into back rooms of various businesses and stuff
16:09:52 <bonegar> wandering around giant hospitals
16:09:53 <Selfie_Dad> and i was hired to be a clerk and computer janitor
16:09:55 <Selfie_Dad> it rocked
16:09:56 <mpg> my first ever job was concessions at a movie theater
16:10:02 <mpg> so i got to see a lot of free movies
16:10:08 <bonegar> i'd like to do that job again tbqh
16:10:09 <mpg> saw Twister and ID4 for free
16:10:09 <Selfie_Dad> when it wasnt busy i dled mp3s on their isdn line
16:10:09 <Rusty> hell yeah
16:10:13 <Selfie_Dad> and played emulators
16:10:15 <Rusty> i somehow never had a movie theater or video store job
16:10:22 <Rusty> probably wanted it too bad.
16:10:27 <Selfie_Dad> and put rated R movvies on in the 'kids corner' tv
16:10:27 <mpg> video store was not as good to me
16:10:37 <mpg> working at blockbuster was ass and i quit via no call/no show
16:10:38 <bonegar> my cushiest teen job was boutique children's toystore
16:10:45 <mpg> and they gave me dirty looks when i rented from there lol
16:10:48 <mpg> fuck em
16:10:53 <Selfie_Dad> yeah blockbuster seems like it would be a shit job
16:11:00 <Selfie_Dad> this place was independent
16:11:12 <Selfie_Dad> and the owner would just have me work hours at a time unattended
16:11:14 <Selfie_Dad> i was like 14
16:11:15 <Selfie_Dad> lol
16:11:19 <mpg> sick
16:11:29 <bonegar> when did the rental market entirely implode, like 2004?
16:11:53 <Selfie_Dad> maybe a bit later
16:11:53 <Selfie_Dad> 06
16:12:05 <Selfie_Dad> i dunno 
16:12:26 <Selfie_Dad> god damn monitors are expensive
16:13:22 <Selfie_Dad> unless u rly want a curved one im not sure why you wouldn just get a TV at this point
16:13:25 <Selfie_Dad> for the price
16:13:50 <Selfie_Dad> 32" 4k monitor is the same price as like a 55" 4k tv
16:14:09 <mpg> what brand? sheesh
16:14:09 <ajj> yeah lol
16:14:11 <ajj> its mad annoying
16:14:22 <Selfie_Dad> im just looking at rtings recs
16:14:42 <Selfie_Dad> the fuckin samsung 1440p monitor they rec is like 750
16:14:50 <mpg> https://www.amazon.com/Dell-UltraSharp-U2720Q-Backlit-Monitor/dp/B086H26XWV/
16:14:57 <mpg> lol jesus
16:15:00 <mpg> no thanks 750
16:15:02 <Selfie_Dad> and so is the gigabyte 4K monitor
16:15:07 <Selfie_Dad> they rec
16:15:19 <mpg> i got dells and they're great
16:15:31 <Selfie_Dad> i mean thats still 6 hundo
16:15:32 <Selfie_Dad> lol
16:15:58 <mpg> how big do you need
16:16:40 <mpg> theres a 27 for 400
16:16:54 <mpg> come to think of it, why wouldn't you get a tv
16:17:00 <mpg> refresh rate?
16:17:36 <mpg> im using displayport for my pc now which i havent seen on a tv
16:19:15 <bonegar> i have an HDMI splitter that mirrors a monitor with my tv, then the tv fixes the aspect ratio
16:19:34 <bonegar> the plex-free lifestyle
16:20:57 <Selfie_Dad> probably refresh rate i guess but idgaf about that
16:21:40 <Selfie_Dad> its kind of a weird thing id like like a 32 to 37 inch screen
16:22:07 <Selfie_Dad> for use as a pc monitor but also for movies and shit
16:22:12 <mpg> yeah
16:22:23 <mpg> i am personally not going for a 4k for quite a while i dont think
16:22:40 <mpg> i have a huge curved 2k screen and i love it
16:22:43 <Selfie_Dad> i think a tv is the way to go but anything under 43 inches is dogshit
16:22:59 <Selfie_Dad> 4k ftw, for movies anyway
16:23:14 <Selfie_Dad> i have less experience with it for gaming
16:23:51 <Selfie_Dad> my tv in the bedroom does 4K HDR10 for the roku for movies
16:23:57 <Selfie_Dad> but it wouldnt play games in 4K in HDR
16:24:01 <Selfie_Dad> had to select either or
16:24:08 <Selfie_Dad> 4K non hdr or 1080P HDR
16:24:09 <bonegar> windows has gotten better about supporting 4k monitors, but only in the last several months it feels like
16:24:11 <Selfie_Dad> really weird
16:24:18 <mpg> huh
16:24:27 <Selfie_Dad> so i havent seen the true power of the ps5 yet really
16:24:29 <mpg> i dont care for hdr so i dont think that would bug me
16:24:32 <Selfie_Dad> my living room tv is 10 yrs old
16:24:42 <Selfie_Dad> hdr is good for some things and not good for others
16:24:46 <Selfie_Dad> i think for games its good
16:24:54 <mpg> i never use it for games
16:25:01 <Selfie_Dad> its not like "hdr" like those stupid pics people make their wallpapers lol
16:25:15 <Selfie_Dad> cool went for a little stroll and my work pc did not lock
16:25:15 <Selfie_Dad> ftw
16:25:22 <mpg> nice
16:25:38 <bonegar> i dunno why hdr would be bad
16:25:48 <bonegar> unless its fake or something
16:26:03 <Selfie_Dad> i could see a dev's implementation of it being bad
16:26:05 <Selfie_Dad> and garish
16:26:10 <Selfie_Dad> but i dont think thats the case for most games
16:27:19 <bonegar> yea, just having actual blacks is nice i think, but some guy color correcting something to exaggerate contrast without understanding why but thinking the technology is cool because they can run a filter is kinda like w/e i guess idk
16:27:44 <mpg> speaking of games i might have to get into some elden ring soon
16:27:49 <mpg> i am approaching endgame finally
16:28:11 <bonegar> i got to the snow giant area last night, then went back and started exploring that poison swamp castle i never went to
16:28:21 <bonegar> still can't beat ansel yet or whatever its called
16:28:36 <Selfie_Dad> i got so mad i lost to godrick when he had like probably 10hp left
16:28:40 <Selfie_Dad> that i havent tried again
16:28:48 <bonegar> classic FROM feel there
16:28:50 <Selfie_Dad> you couldnt even see red in his health bar
16:28:51 <mpg> yeah dude
16:28:52 <Selfie_Dad> when i died
16:29:00 <bonegar> we've all been there, we know this pain
16:29:03 <mpg> i have a screen cap of when that exact thing happened to me
16:29:08 <mpg> on godrick
16:29:22 <Selfie_Dad> squat time
16:29:29 <Selfie_Dad> im gonna have to do something about the lighting down here
16:29:32 <bonegar> i want to say i double K.O'd at least one boss and got the win even though i YOU DIED
16:29:34 <Selfie_Dad> quite bright 
16:29:48 <Selfie_Dad> the first time i fought him i died right as i got him tophase 2
16:29:54 <Selfie_Dad> so it started the whole cinematic
16:29:58 <Selfie_Dad> and did the whole thing
16:30:02 <Selfie_Dad> and then reset me
16:30:02 <Selfie_Dad> lol
16:30:04 <mpg> lol
16:30:24 <mpg> idk if you're using summons or not, but i summoned the wolves right as phase 2 started and that helped a lot
16:30:38 <mpg> takes a bit of pressure off
16:31:06 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i use the jelly fish
16:31:17 <Selfie_Dad> i should probably wait till phase 2 to summon it
16:31:26 <mpg> that was ultimate what got me the win
16:31:27 <Selfie_Dad> but ive upgraded it a bit so it lasted almost the whole fight
16:31:31 <mpg> cos i kept losing them in phase 1
16:31:35 <Selfie_Dad> when i almost beat him
16:31:41 <bonegar> yea he has a nasty attack that can just KO you

16:47:52 <Melber> oh man i missed a bunch of the confirmation hearing already
16:49:06 <Melber> everyone is making a big deal about her being the first black woman on the court and the first public defender on the court but i think they're all ignoring that i believe she will be the first improv comedian on the court
16:49:11 <Selfie_Dad> i cant its like a 2 hr meeting
16:49:14 <Selfie_Dad> and im already warmed up
16:51:25 <Selfie_Dad> im gonna just mute on the last set and hope nobody asks me to speak
16:52:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> braun for a 3rd is the most boring trade of all time
16:52:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> which is fine 
16:52:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> i still want to go big for forsberg (also fine with rakell)
16:53:26 <mikev> preds are buying now
16:53:34 <mikev> i don't see them trading filip 
16:53:35 <wild_ape-style_creature> seems like forsberg might stay in nashville
16:54:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> that's dumb of them unless they think they can extend him
16:55:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> it would be cool to get jt miller back too 
16:55:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> or phil the thrill...

17:23:38 <Melber> lmao larry king
17:23:43 <Selfie_Dad> what a cast
17:27:21 <HellaBrad> the bigger a celebrity the funnier it is to have them engage with a puppet
17:27:30 <HellaBrad> the muppets understood this well
17:27:41 <Rusty> fact
17:28:53 <Selfie_Dad> its funny that they have the woman from madtv on there
17:29:58 <Melber> she's gotta be like the fourth most successful madtv cast member, right?
17:30:21 <Melber> i guess phil lamarr is probably up there
17:30:54 <Melber> and maybe frank caliendo
17:35:36 <Selfie_Dad> who are the most, key and peele, then who
17:36:14 <het> alex borstein probably just beyond key and peele imho
17:36:21 <Selfie_Dad> oh yeah i forget about he
17:36:22 <Selfie_Dad> r
17:36:34 <Selfie_Dad> possibly more successful just from voice work
17:36:39 <het> right
17:36:57 <het> but also marvelous mrs maisel
17:37:00 <Selfie_Dad> i guess peele is the most since hes a whole ass feature film director

17:38:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> 1:27 PM <HellaBrad> the muppets understood this well
17:38:29 <Melber> but yeah i was gonna say borstein probably most successful financially
17:38:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> you know the tweet/general conjecture that has gone viral numerous times about taking the cast of a movie and replacing everyone except one person in the movie with muppets
17:39:17 <HellaBrad> a classic format
17:39:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> i still think i had the best idea for that ever, which is yojimbo but everyone except toshiro mifune is a muppet
17:39:31 <HellaBrad> ahahahaha
17:39:31 <dreddybajs> lol
17:39:45 <dreddybajs> the bounty apart from antony hopkins
17:39:53 <Selfie_Dad> lol
17:39:57 <ajj> lmfao tom
17:40:08 <Selfie_Dad> how about the bear, but the bear is a muppet
17:40:09 <HellaBrad> kurosawa muppets is a great idea
17:40:16 <Selfie_Dad> this also works w/ the revenant 
17:40:20 <Melber> i was about to say
17:40:30 <Melber> fozzy tossing leo across the woods
17:40:35 <Selfie_Dad> ya lmao
17:40:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> happy gilmore but everyone except shooter mcgavin is a muppet
17:41:22 <dreddybajs> uncut gums apart from kevin garnett
17:41:23 <Melber> seventh seal and i can't decide if it's everyone but death or jons
17:41:24 <dreddybajs> gems
17:41:33 <dreddybajs> death would be played by beaker Melber 
17:41:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol

17:41:41 <Selfie_Dad> uncut gums
17:41:42 <dreddybajs> in a hood
17:41:59 <Melber> beaker is my favorite muppet because his mouth movement is the funniest to do an impression of

17:42:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> incredible stuff
17:42:46 <Selfie_Dad> requiem for a dream and the only non muppet is keith david 
17:42:53 <dreddybajs> lol
17:43:02 <dreddybajs> the two old arguing guys announcing ass to ass
17:43:07 <Selfie_Dad> lmao

17:43:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmao
17:44:55 <Melber> there will be blood, and sam eagle is daniel plainview.  his son, scooter, goes deaf.
17:44:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> adaptation and the only non muppet is brian cox
17:45:12 <dreddybajs> brian cox would be the swedish chef
17:45:45 <Melber> a lot of PTA movies are kind of easy to imagine because fozzie is basically interchangable with john c reilly
17:45:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats true
17:46:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> how about boogie nights and the only non muppet is philip seymour hoffman
17:47:01 <Melber> Homie_in_a_geod: i was going over that in my head and i was like "which muppet will be william h macy" which led to "which muppet suicide would be the least traumatizing"
17:47:14 <Melber> and i have to again conclude it would be beaker since he's constantly blowing up anyway
17:47:49 <dreddybajs> i feel like bert would be the most likely muppet suicide
17:47:52 <Melber> and so now im thinking of muppet boogie nights and after his suicide scene beaker's showing up in the background anyway
17:48:02 <dreddybajs> lol
17:48:15 <dreddybajs> thats making me think of slenderman with bert 
17:48:22 <dreddybajs> i mean beaker
17:48:23 <Melber> im not comfortable putting sesame street muppets in boogie nights because then im forced to conclude that big bird must be dirk diggler
17:50:44 <HellaBrad> jaws and keep richard dreyfuss
17:51:14 <dreddybajs> would that mean the shark would be a muppet
17:51:48 <Selfie_Dad> love when my meetings pivot to the technical issues stemming from deceased babies
17:51:53 <HellaBrad> i think depending on your definition the shark was a muppet all along
17:52:42 <Rusty> .y robert de niro sesame street cabbage
17:52:55 <HellaBrad> i was just thinking it would be funny to have gonzo as muppet quint going "ahhh! oh no! hes biting me ahhh!" and bouncing around in a big mechanical shark mouth
17:53:16 <Melber> if it wasnt made in jim henson's creature shop it's not a muppet
17:53:31 <dreddybajs> moneyball / brad pitt would be good

18:09:26 <wild_ape-style_creature> wonder if we'll sign him after the season ends
18:09:30 <Melber> my wife got me a good plant for the office
18:09:48 <wild_ape-style_creature> half the avs have contract renewals coming up after this season
18:09:52 <Melber> https://easyplant.com/ one of these
18:10:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> he shouldnt cost much to re-sign
18:11:57 <wild_ape-style_creature> it depends on the cap space after whatever current avs we re-sign
18:12:16 <wild_ape-style_creature> https://www.capfriendly.com/teams/avalanche this is scary
18:13:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> dont see how you can keep both of burakovsky and kadri

18:13:19 <wild_ape-style_creature> one of them is leaving and it's sad!
18:13:32 <wild_ape-style_creature> also really not looking forward to mackinnon's contract after next year

19:24:33 <ehn> that sucks
19:24:36 <wild_ape-style_creature> ): i'm sorry
19:25:34 <Melber> Damnit there's apparently a story on the athletic about all the insane shit urban Meyer did in Jacksonville but it's behind a paywall
19:25:38 <mpg> it'll be fine it just feels like the future with family is only going to be painful
19:26:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> Melber: i have a sub if you have a link

19:29:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> Melber: here's a pdf if that is helpful. all of the links are typed out in it because i guess thats how that crap works so that might be a bit annoying but w/e https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/pCHuiInX/%E2%80%98The%20most%20toxic%20environment%20I%E2%80%99ve%20ever%20been%20a%20part%20of%E2%80%99_%20Inside%20Urban%20Meyer%E2%80%99s%20disastrous%20year%20with%20Jaguars%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Athletic.pdf

19:30:23 <wild_ape-style_creature> i've got an addon that blocks paywalls if you guys want it
19:30:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think the athletic paywall works that way

19:32:31 <mikev> ask me how i know...
19:32:34 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah you can turn it off for nyt
19:32:44 <wild_ape-style_creature> i found this out after losing my scores
19:32:45 <mikev> i did but it still kept messing it up
19:32:48 <mikev> so i just keep it off
19:33:01 <wild_ape-style_creature> i stopped playing anyway because the nyt word bank is not as fun
19:33:01 <mikev> until i need it
19:33:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
19:33:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> multiple sources said Meyer was unfamiliar with star players around the league, including 49ers receiver Deebo Samuel, Seahawks safety Jamal Adams and Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald, a three-time NFL defensive player of the year.
19:33:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> “Who’s this 99 guy on the Rams?” Meyer asked one staffer during the season, according to a source. “I’m hearing he might be a problem for us.”
19:33:34 <dreddybajs> lol
19:33:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont know shit about football but i know about aaron donald
19:34:35 <Melber> Yeah
19:35:27 <Melber> Our site blocker at work lets me access the NYT games but blocks whatever it is that tracks progress and connects it to my account which is tremendously annoying
19:36:19 <mikev> Animec (1978–87) was the flagship magazine where many of the intellectual foundations for anime criticism were being laid down, and it was here that the famous “Is Gundam SF?” debate took place, a portent of the growing divide between SF and anime fans (or fans of literary SF and visual SF)
19:36:20 <mikev> lol
19:36:28 <mikev> the famous anime vs sci fi debate

19:59:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> no one knows what the rangers traded for copp still
19:59:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
20:01:22 <bonegar> is gundam SF? *thinking* yea, probably, they got laser swords. debate solved.
20:02:01 <ehn> theyre in space its sf
20:02:44 <bonegar> there's always space, but there isn't always laser swords
20:03:02 <ehn> if it uses Space as a setting, its considered "hard" scifi
20:03:16 <bonegar> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_science_fiction lol crazy wikipedia article here
20:03:37 <bonegar> we'll see who does the considering
20:09:51 <Selfie_Dad> ive heard that space
20:09:52 <Selfie_Dad> is the place
20:10:08 <bonegar> take me to your arkestra
20:15:03 <mikev> just checked and yes it's true that doug armstrong made a stupid terrible trade
20:15:15 <mikev> i hope the blues lose like 5-1 in their next game with horrific defense from leddy
20:15:28 <mikev> gotta rub the dog's nose in it when they do something wrong
20:17:18 <mikev> it's cool that jake walman is just as good as leddy but younger and cheaper
20:17:21 <mikev> gotta move him though
20:17:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> update 20 minutes after last update: still, no one knows what the rangers traded for copp
20:18:27 -!- NORG [~NORG@synIRC-E2E297F7.tx.res.rr.com] has joined #phiz
20:18:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> people only know they didnt trade lundkvist or kravtsov
20:19:21 <mikev> lmao here's the best the blues beat reporter who loves to tongue the team's asshole can do
20:19:22 <mikev> It remains to be seen, but perhaps they can let Leddy step in and do his thing while having Parayko play more of a defensive role? That's a lot to hope for with a defenseman who has struggled defensively in Detroit. But at the very least, Leddy can give the Blues some depth, and if somehow he ends up in the third pairing with Robert Bortuzzo, the Blues have still improved their group overall.
20:19:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> update: now they know the picks https://twitter.com/DarrenDreger/status/1506002327924269063
20:19:39 <mikev> copp isn't particularly good is he
20:19:46 <mikev> i don't remember seeing him stand out in blues games
20:19:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> he's good
20:19:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> not great but good
20:20:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> if he's used defensively he's one of the best pure defensive and pk forwards in the league, but he's been used more offensively in the last year and he's not as good at that
20:22:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/ESDargis/status/1506002642362843140 this is a good lineup apart from reaves (and hopefully schneider over nemeth)
20:22:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> also chytil would go wing and copp center in that configuration
20:22:35 <Melber> talkin hockey
20:22:36 <Melber> tockey
20:22:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> you got a problem with that.
20:22:57 <Melber> dont tell me what i got a problem with
20:23:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> You have a problem with it.
20:23:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh good we traded an actual fucking prospect too
20:23:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> urrrggghhh
20:25:14 <mikev> at least you got a somewhat useful player
20:25:18 <mikev> instead of the husk of nick leddy
20:26:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> some of the stats guys had interesting stuff to say about leddy
20:27:28 <dreddybajs> new drip https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ToXkcxxS/image.png
20:27:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> mikev: one guy said specifically that he actually has very good numbers off the rush but awful numbers in either zone, which doesnt work in detroits system but stl's is a better fit
20:28:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> he used to be so good on the isles only a few years ago, if he can still skate maybe there's something there
20:28:24 <HellaBrad> sick hat
20:28:48 <mikev> yeah but the blues have very very bad defense
20:28:57 <mikev> and not a bad offense (although they are way outperforming their underlying numbers)
20:29:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> a d that can give you positive zone entries is a defensive boost
20:29:24 <dreddybajs> ya HellaBrad i love it
20:29:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> he plays the transition game well, was the gist of it, but detroit don't have a transition system
20:30:22 <mikev> he's also UFA, so i are they goign to re-sign him?
20:30:28 <mikev> make their team even older going forward?
20:30:42 <mikev> at best it's a lateral move imo
20:33:20 <eric> Very possibly there's some reference I don't get here but in lieu of that I can relate https://www.instagram.com/p/CbX-0qru-8q/?utm_medium=copy_link
20:34:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> i highly doubt they're going to re-sign him
20:34:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> he's playoff depth idk. there were better guys out there but i don't think they gave up too terribly much
20:34:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> i like the rangers' depth d trade
20:36:51 <Selfie_Dad> honus honus

20:50:36 <bonegar> wrestling seems like it would thrive in legecy mediums like tv tbqh
20:55:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> wwe does
20:56:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> wwe also makes a product for idiots and/or children which is ultimately more profitable than the alternative
20:57:02 <bonegar> never met anyone that wasn't an idiot or a child so.. that's pretty much the entire market on earth
20:57:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> none of us are idiots or children with the exception of ajj
20:58:37 <bonegar> oh so you figured out how to feed yourself?
20:58:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> pretty unnecessarily rude thing to say there
20:59:06 <bonegar> are we not joking around? sry
20:59:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean maybe not about things that have very recently caused actual consternation
21:00:24 <bonegar> ok scrub that, pretend i called you an idiot instead
21:00:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> thanks much better
21:01:03 <bonegar> 🙏 bless up 
21:01:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> its really weird how people on wikipedia have like, actual pictures of every airplane on the planet at the ready to attach to an article about one of them crashing when that happens 
21:01:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/bSEppGDt/image.png
21:01:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wanna know more about the guys who take pictures of commercial aircraft scene
21:02:19 <dreddybajs> yeah its similar to trainspotting i guess
21:03:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> i guess. it kind of feels like, in the wikipedia context, it's like... just rooting for them to crash? but idk maybe the people who take the pics and upload them to wikimedia don't have that in mind somehow (despite there being no other conceivable utility for this)
21:03:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> i always assumed nascar fans were rooting for crashes too because what the fuck else happens in a nascar race
21:04:14 <NORG> Turn left. Pit stop. Dirty air. 
21:04:26 <bonegar> you could probably say the same for most motor sports. they just drivin cars
21:04:44 <bonegar> i'll take nascaar over f1, but rally looks the funnest
21:06:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> f1 theyve gotta turn in different directions and the passing is more interesting i think but i don't care about any of them
21:06:39 <NORG> f1 is great the race yesterday was what we call a Laugh Riot
21:06:50 <bonegar> f1 is too eurobrit and too much about supplychain middle management stuff
21:07:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> the concept of being excited about a car company building their cars really well is not something that moves the proverbial needle for me
21:07:14 <dreddybajs> they also change up the car rules a lot in f1 which i think leads to interesting design dynamics, im not sure if thats so much a thing in nascar too?
21:07:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i simply do not care about the skill of drivers to do whatever it is they do well
21:07:25 <NORG> ya
21:07:29 <bonegar> i would want to toot around in the woods in a car
21:07:35 <bonegar> that's pretty much how i feel about it
21:07:37 <NORG> i like when the cars improve over a season & also the driver i like wins by driving his car fast
21:07:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> i guess thats fine but i cant watch hours of it
21:07:55 <NORG> & it is the messiest sport of crybaby billionaires. ah how i love to see them cry
21:08:18 <dreddybajs> i think motorbikes are cool
21:08:22 <dreddybajs> whatever they call that sport
21:08:36 <NORG> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMyCFCG1r5Y
21:08:36 <bonegar> i want to get a honda grom
21:08:39 <NORG> ABGRY
21:08:39 <bonegar> and get into dirt biking
21:08:43 <bonegar> but just kinda in a casual rural hick way
21:09:13 <bonegar> maybe do a jump off of some garbage behind a warehouse
21:09:55 <bonegar> the E-F1 or whatever sounds really funny because they have alll sorts of lame tech gimmicks
21:10:14 <bonegar> like fans can boost the cars by sending bits or like sor something insane
21:10:53 <NORG> lol yes
21:10:58 <NORG> driver fan boost or w/e it is
21:14:14 <ajj> <Homie_in_a_geod> none of us are idiots or children with the exception of ajj
