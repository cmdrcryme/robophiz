01:10:25 <wild_ape-style_creature> my dad is getting certified to fly over dc airspace so he can fly to my house lol

01:11:10 <HellaBrad> some people had to go and wreck it for the rest of us
01:11:21 <bonegar> i guess it makes sense after that famous day

01:11:47 <wild_ape-style_creature> he has no idea why but he's taking the test next weekend and can answer that question then
01:14:55 <wild_ape-style_creature> oh wait he's doing this online after he gets off the phone
01:15:05 <wild_ape-style_creature> it's cool that he's drunk as hell taking a flight safety course

01:15:51 <wild_ape-style_creature> he's something
01:15:53 <HellaBrad> if you can ace the test drunk i bet youre twice as good a pilot sober as the average man
01:18:14 <wild_ape-style_creature> he's planning on shuttering his shop and becoming a skydiving instructor and jump pilot
01:18:16 <bonegar> i think the problem with that is balancing the alcohol for decades long durations
01:19:33 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah he's not good at that

05:11:11 <wild_ape-style_creature> i've seen a lot of them somehow
05:11:45 <wild_ape-style_creature> maybe one or two multiple times since there are only 25 in the entire world

13:57:29 <dreddybajs> that area is such a pain
13:57:45 <dreddybajs> you can go up the tower and kill the guys and the tower stops hitting you

15:23:46 <mandarin_toni> thuis is the only piece of classical music where im like i can tell apart different versions and say which ones i prefer
15:23:51 <mandarin_toni> this one isnt to my taste
15:23:56 <mandarin_toni> too phlegmatic
15:25:57 <Nude_Riker> i should do something today but hm what
15:26:10 <Nude_Riker> taking tomorrow off and itll be nice so ill hike tomorrow
15:27:22 <Nude_Riker> lol you still have to make reservations to visit the museum by me, keeping that covid measure in place for some reason
15:27:23 <mandarin_toni> i was out for a few hours and soon ill go watch the rome derby inna pub
15:28:48 <bonegar> you could go to hooters
15:29:08 <bonegar> .g hooters baltimore
15:30:08 <Nude_Riker> and of course today is booked up so i cant go to the museum even though im sure like half those people wont show up for their booking
15:30:11 <Nude_Riker> because its free
15:31:02 <bonegar> guess youll have to go to hooters instead
15:31:23 <Nude_Riker> yup
15:32:21 <bonegar> museums are over i guess
15:32:25 <bonegar> covid killed museums
15:32:55 <Nude_Riker> the other free museum doesnt have that stupid system but that one is a 2 mile walk not a 5 minute walk

15:40:15 <Nude_Riker> not a movie im very enthused about but theres nothing else playing
15:40:19 <bonegar> i am very excited to hear about your the batman thoughts if you do this
15:40:29 <bonegar> yea i just kinda went to go see kinda thing
15:41:02 <Nude_Riker> this sounds like a nice plan altogether i guess
15:41:39 <Nude_Riker> oh right i need to take a picture of my vax card
15:44:31 <Nude_Riker> Batman must forge new relationships, unmask the culprit, and bring justice to the abuse of power and corruption that has long plagued Gotham City.
15:45:59 <bonegar> i had a picture of mine just in case but the christian teen did not ask for it
15:47:34 <NORG> Hello to everyone :)
15:48:52 <mikev> hi
15:48:53 <bonegar> hi norg
16:03:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> p
16:07:27 <Nude_Riker> remembered the batman is 3 hours not doing that
16:18:37 <eric> good morn
16:19:20 <wild_ape-style_creature> hello to everyone who has woken up
16:19:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> Nude_Riker you can watch jackass 3d instead
16:23:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> broth
16:23:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol https://twitter.com/friendlykitties/status/1505199006808698887?s=21
16:28:18 -!- ehn [uid253142@synIRC-3B43673D.helmsley.irccloud.com] has joined #phiz
16:34:06 <Nude_Riker> damnit i forgot my ereader is maybe busted too so there goes bar reading
16:35:54 <NORG> tunic seems cool
16:36:01 <NORG> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/178016065802993665/955141255338274906/uw8T2q6.png
16:36:04 <NORG> [OK]
16:36:51 <Nude_Riker> OK
16:37:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> tum
16:37:37 <bonegar> However, like all beans, beans also harbor antinutrients, which reduce your bodyâ€™s ability to absorb minerals from the beans. 
16:37:55 <bonegar> .g antinutrients in beans
16:38:44 <Nude_Riker> yes its true, pulses have phytates and stuff that prevent absorption of other nutrients
16:39:02 <Nude_Riker> gotta process them correctly to get rid of em
16:39:10 <bonegar> how do i get rid of them
16:39:21 <bonegar> i dont think im processing my beans correctly
16:39:41 <Nude_Riker> sprouting and fermentation are the two most reliable ways, theres also some sort of lime processing iirc
16:39:52 <bonegar> so i cant just eat them?
16:39:56 <bonegar> guess im quitting beans again
16:40:08 <Nude_Riker> you can, but then you wont get the minerals and stuff you could otherwise
16:40:13 <mikev> i've made my salsa
16:40:16 <bonegar> so no point to eat them
16:40:29 <eric> it doesnt block all of them
16:40:31 <eric> im sure
16:40:31 <Nude_Riker> well, you still get the protein and stuff, but not the micronutrients
16:40:44 <Nude_Riker> yeah it lowers the uptake rate a lot though
16:40:50 <mikev> is that u fart a lot on beans
16:40:52 <mikev> why
16:40:56 <bonegar> im not gonna ferment the beans or cure them with lyme
16:41:04 <Nude_Riker> no thats separate, and you just need to cook them long enough to avoid the farding
16:41:23 <bonegar> beans are cancelled. bad food.
16:41:32 <mikev> i don't fart too much on them so i guess i cook them long enough
16:42:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmfao https://twitter.com/terryhintzfan/status/1505221857552723970?s=21
16:43:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> $6 SRIMP SPECIAL

16:46:40 <bonegar> i want batter fried fish and a big salad

16:47:30 <eric> that sounds good
16:47:34 <eric> fish and salad
16:47:45 <bonegar> ya but i dont think i can reasonably get that
16:48:01 <eric> maybe a two stop meal deal
16:48:50 <bonegar> .g best fast food fried fish
16:49:26 <bonegar> popeyes has fish?
16:49:28 <bonegar> *thinking*
16:49:33 <bonegar> i could get myself sick, become a devil
16:52:23 <HellaBrad> go for it, get the popeyes fish

17:18:16 <wild_ape-style_creature> i think i wa sin the 70s?
17:18:31 <wild_ape-style_creature> this morning i
17:18:43 <wild_ape-style_creature> 've beaten like 3 or 4 minor bosses and one ofthose fucked up erdtree dragons
17:18:58 <wild_ape-style_creature> ulcerated tree spirit
17:19:04 <HellaBrad> those guys are just the worst
17:19:09 <mpg> oh yeah i enjoy those fights
17:19:16 <wild_ape-style_creature> they're fun yeah
17:19:17 <mpg> somehow im good at them but i dont exactly know why
17:19:19 <bonegar> i should go back and mop up some of the other overworld big guys from the earlier zones
17:19:27 <wild_ape-style_creature> bonegar that's kind of what i'm doing
17:19:33 <eric> any of the guys guarding the trees have always instantly owned me
17:19:47 <bonegar> i dont think i can beat ansel or w/e hes called yet
17:19:49 <wild_ape-style_creature> horseback battle, summon a guy
17:20:04 <bonegar> those tree guardian guys are tricky
17:20:11 <wild_ape-style_creature> i run in circles around the erdtree avatars til they start shooting spells and hten i hide behind the tree
17:20:13 <mpg> they used to be weak to freeze but idk anymore in new patch
17:20:16 <wild_ape-style_creature> either sword or magic
17:20:23 <mpg> trees are def weak to fire tho
17:20:32 <eric> got to use sword i guess
17:20:39 <wild_ape-style_creature> oh yeah you're a dagger fan
17:20:46 <wild_ape-style_creature> try sword
17:20:48 <wild_ape-style_creature> try jumping
17:21:00 <wild_ape-style_creature> i just got an erdtree avatar this morning actually
17:21:26 <bonegar> it's nice to carry a dagger around with a cool war art on it drop 
17:21:26 <eric> my sword right now is shamshir
17:21:41 <HellaBrad> did you find the twig gem yet, thats really useful for if you accidentally walk into a boss room without realizing it
17:21:55 <eric> but my normal build is reduvia and another cool dag i found in storm vale
17:21:59 <wild_ape-style_creature> i have a few of those but i have never considered using them
17:22:05 <eric> dual weilding rocks
17:22:18 <wild_ape-style_creature> i should dual wield my katanas for godfrey battle
17:22:31 <wild_ape-style_creature> i think i probably shouldn't be fighting him yet because i haven't finished ranni quest
17:22:35 <bonegar> godfrey was very easy for me
17:22:39 <wild_ape-style_creature> but w/e i'm here might as well
17:22:46 <bonegar> got him on my second attempt solo i think
17:22:48 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah i got him down pretty far, i just wsan't prepared
17:22:59 <wild_ape-style_creature> using the dragon lightning spear summon guy
17:23:12 <wild_ape-style_creature> marionette skeletons are too weak for him i think
17:23:50 <wild_ape-style_creature> i gotta go get my pizza but i will beat him when i return
17:23:59 <bonegar> i've been using the two sword ladies summon a lot, it's probably my strongest atm, i haven't leveled up any of the summons yet tho
17:24:36 <wild_ape-style_creature> idk if i've met them
17:24:36 <bonegar> for awhile i was a big fan of the lil guys with the huge shields
17:24:49 <wild_ape-style_creature> my marionettes are like... +7
17:24:54 <bonegar> they kinda turtle up and throw bombs
17:24:55 <eric> https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Misericorde this is what im dual weilding with
17:25:03 <wild_ape-style_creature> dragon warrior is +4 or 5

17:27:03 <Selfie_Dad> i got that dagg too eric
17:27:06 <Selfie_Dad> havent used it much though
17:27:13 <Selfie_Dad> been doing the oochie wally katana

17:28:03 <wild_ape-style_creature> is eating pizza today a bad idea bonegar
17:28:09 <wild_ape-style_creature> am i cursing myself
17:28:16 <Selfie_Dad> eating pizza's always a bad idea unfortunately
17:28:20 <Selfie_Dad> but it has to be done sometimes
17:28:23 <Selfie_Dad> no way around it
17:28:58 <wild_ape-style_creature> hmm true
17:29:03 <bonegar> just dont eat too much of it
17:29:05 <bonegar> easy
17:29:45 <bonegar> i ate the chicken sandwich after all
17:29:45 <Selfie_Dad> yeah
17:29:48 <Selfie_Dad> thats my strat
17:29:58 <Selfie_Dad> the pizza strat is usually, eat something else before pizza
17:30:07 <Nude_Riker> eating pizza is not always a bad idea its often a good idea
17:30:10 <Selfie_Dad> so you can have the pizza without going crazy on the pizza
17:30:12 <eric> i love to eat it
17:30:16 <Nude_Riker> pizza ftw
17:30:17 <eric> i may do i t tonight even
17:30:24 <Nude_Riker> i ate pizza last night
17:30:25 <Selfie_Dad> no its always bad. it tastes too good, and its bad in every other respect
17:30:37 <Selfie_Dad> satiety, nutrition, tummy feels, all bad
17:30:45 <Nude_Riker> my tummy felt fine
17:30:56 <Selfie_Dad> sounds like you didnt eat a satiating amount of pizza
17:30:58 <eric> and matt has a notoriously tempermental tum
17:31:12 <Selfie_Dad> which by my estimation is at least 1500 calories
17:31:19 <Nude_Riker> i was satisfied
17:31:30 <bonegar> like thoes old icelandic ladies that only eat hardtack biscuits, he can survive on frozen pizzas fine
17:32:00 <Nude_Riker> time to read book and drink tea and enjoy cancelling my own plans ?:)

17:39:53 <bonegar> it'd be so cool to know a hunter
17:39:57 <Nude_Riker> yeah
17:40:28 <Nude_Riker> i like that i came up with a second plan for today and immediately decided actually its for tomorrow due to deals
17:40:41 <bonegar> it'd be so cool to have the room and space to be able to process an entire deer too
17:40:47 <wild_ape-style_creature> my dad's ex gf and her husband saw a deer get hit by a car so they scooped it up, butchered it in their bathroom, then brought the meat over and grilled it
17:40:56 <mpg> lmao
17:40:59 <bonegar> lol
17:41:02 <Nude_Riker> nice
17:41:03 <mpg> that's pretty metal
17:41:03 <bonegar> that's a sentence
17:41:20 <scoop_jackson> that rules
17:41:24 <eric> yeah were going with a veggie friend danielle
17:41:30 <eric> so i hope they are happy with it
17:41:37 <wild_ape-style_creature> vietnamese ingenuity ftw
17:41:42 <Selfie_Dad> martin potato roll is the good classic burg bun imo
17:41:54 <Selfie_Dad> Hawaiian roll sounds like a fun alt though
17:41:57 <scoop_jackson> a lot of good burger buns imo
17:41:59 <Nude_Riker> yeah i like potato bun
17:42:02 <wild_ape-style_creature> well it sounds good to me so i'm sure your friend will like it
17:42:03 <scoop_jackson> i havent tried the hawaiian roll tho
17:42:10 <eric> portugeues roll can be a good bun in a binch
17:42:32 <mpg> yeah i only now learned its actuall a portuguese sweet roll
17:42:47 <bonegar> i think i like the potato bun the most out of the standard burger bun styles
17:42:53 <eric> we watched top chef last night btw
17:42:57 <eric> good riddance to bad rubbish
17:43:10 <Nude_Riker> did a judge leave or something
17:43:14 <Nude_Riker> or just a bad contestant
17:43:21 <eric> a real;ly annoying contestant
17:43:29 <wild_ape-style_creature> lmao
17:43:32 <eric> very youtube channel vibe about them
17:43:35 <mpg> lol
17:44:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> he's really corny but the daikon and meat dish seemed worse
17:44:24 <eric> yeah
17:44:38 <eric> do u watch last chance kitchen
17:45:03 <wild_ape-style_creature> generally yeah but i haven't this season yet
17:45:16 <wild_ape-style_creature> sec driving back home
17:45:31 <eric> in the main show the bottom dishes seemd awful but everything else seemed really great
17:47:05 <eric> well buddhas dish looked good but the judges description made it sound bad
17:50:43 <eric> damn i never knew before that marie antoinette actually said let them eat brioche
17:51:19 <eric> oh reading further she didnt say it at all lol
17:52:32 <eric> ppl have been ragging on her about some misattributed heresay written by rousseau
17:52:43 <Selfie_Dad> i havent watched any top chef yet
17:52:46 <Selfie_Dad> havent had the time
17:52:50 <Selfie_Dad> how many eps now
17:52:51 <Selfie_Dad> 3?
17:52:55 <eric> yeah
17:53:05 <eric> its a good season so far some really strong contestants
17:53:31 <eric> and its more normal 
17:58:54 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah this season is cool
17:59:03 -!- bonegar [ghost@skeleton.zone] has joined #phiz
17:59:11 <wild_ape-style_creature> the worst chefs were very obvious
18:01:41 <eric> yeah the person who lost on the second ep was shockingly bad in comparison
18:01:48 <eric> top chef canada level
18:02:06 <wild_ape-style_creature> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/IcWvMayP/20220320_140140.jpg
18:03:01 <Selfie_Dad> pizza cat
18:03:19 <Selfie_Dad> im stoked for masterchef australia coming back in a month
18:03:24 <eric> top chef canada is so funny it really does not inspire confidence in canadian cuisine
18:03:27 <Selfie_Dad> wild_ape-style_creature and eric u should watch that w/ me
18:03:30 <Selfie_Dad> when it start
18:03:46 <eric> but im guessing its mostly because they dont make it worthwhile to compete vs just doing your normal job
18:04:18 <HellaBrad> masterchef australia is really good
18:04:19 <eric> is that the one where its like a new episode 5 days a week
18:04:22 <Nude_Riker> top chef canada ftw
18:04:23 <Nude_Riker> i miss it
18:04:24 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah sure
18:04:33 <wild_ape-style_creature> i watched other seasons of it
18:04:40 <wild_ape-style_creature> easy to fall behind though
18:04:48 <Nude_Riker> well i mean canada is also you know a lot smaller than america so it makes sense the talent pool is smaller
18:04:57 <Nude_Riker> populationwise i mean
18:05:09 <eric> for sure but there is good food in canada
18:05:35 <eric> and there is not good food on that show
18:05:49 <Nude_Riker> yeah of course but fewer who can take the time out and so on
18:06:07 <eric> thats what i mean if youre on top chef normal you can get 10 grand just for winning
18:06:10 <eric> a challenge
18:06:14 <Nude_Riker> ya
18:06:19 <eric> and youre probably paid way better just to appear on the show
18:06:37 <Nude_Riker> thats part of why i like top chef canada tbh
18:06:38 <eric> like if youre on top chef canada you might have to close your restaurant for months
18:06:45 <Nude_Riker> its less dazzling
18:06:48 <eric> to get    ? i dont know how much
18:07:30 <Nude_Riker> oh i didnt know they ran tcc in 2021
18:07:36 <eric> yep
18:07:54 <eric> we watched an episode and it was like oh this is just pub food
18:08:08 <eric> who can sear the best cod filet who cares
18:08:11 <Nude_Riker> In a very special Quickfire Challenge, the chefs get some virtual help from a group of mini-sous chefs from The Boys and Girls Club of Canada. In the Elimination Challenge, the competitors get an education in Indigenous ingredients and cooking before serving an unforgettable menu at a traditional Longhouse.
18:09:11 <Nude_Riker> mark mcewan is a very red faced man these days
18:09:25 <Nude_Riker> ruddy
18:09:56 <Selfie_Dad> yeah maybe the prestige of winning top chef canada isnt worth the opportunity cost
18:10:04 <eric> thats what im thinking
18:10:28 <eric> like if youve already got a successful restaurant thats probably the safer bet
18:10:35 <Nude_Riker> damn already 3 eps in to new top chef season im not sure i can catch up in time
18:11:33 <Selfie_Dad> i think you could catch up in roughly an hour and 45 minutes actually.
18:12:03 <Selfie_Dad> maybe ill watch some now
18:12:21 <Selfie_Dad> but i kinda wanna enter the world of the Ring
18:13:08 <Nude_Riker> im download ep1
18:14:08 <wild_ape-style_creature> top chef canada contestants are boring too
18:14:26 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm gonna watch the last chance kitchens now while i fight godfrey
18:15:02 <wild_ape-style_creature> btw bros if you're not downloading your tv shows use this site now that primewire was killed by netflix https://bstsrs.one/

18:16:23 <mpg> for shows
18:16:28 <Selfie_Dad> this always happens when he falls asleep in the car 5 min from home
18:16:44 <wild_ape-style_creature> how do you make a child sleep
18:17:09 <wild_ape-style_creature> i babysat exactly one single time and i had to call my mom to change the diaper because i was too freaked out
18:17:15 <wild_ape-style_creature> idk anything about kids
18:17:29 <eric> me neithjer
18:17:40 <eric> they seem gross but kind of cool
18:18:00 <wild_ape-style_creature> last night on the phone my dad was like... prying to see if i wanted kids
18:18:11 <wild_ape-style_creature> he's never done that before
18:18:25 <eric> saras grandma is always trying to get us 1. to get married 2. to have kids
18:18:28 <Selfie_Dad> you cant make a child sleep
18:18:31 <Selfie_Dad> thats the problem
18:18:33 <Selfie_Dad> but they need it
18:18:41 <eric> claiming that doing those will make us feel even more in love with each other
18:18:42 <wild_ape-style_creature> my dad said "please continue being crotchety" when i said "god no"
18:18:43 <eric> im suspiciouis
18:18:45 <scoop_jackson> lol
18:18:54 <Selfie_Dad> hes just sitting in his bed looking at a car
18:18:56 <HellaBrad> kids are fun and cool imo but i will pass on that
18:18:57 <eric> since she has grandchildren and fucking hated her husband
18:18:58 <Selfie_Dad> for the last 30 min
18:19:03 <wild_ape-style_creature> lmao his car
18:19:27 <scoop_jackson> a lot of my friends are havin kids so i think i should probably have a kid pronto
18:19:36 <wild_ape-style_creature> kids are terrifying and foreign to me and i feel very uncomfortable around them generally
18:19:48 <Selfie_Dad> yeah guess what 
18:19:50 <Selfie_Dad> so did i
18:19:55 <Nude_Riker> lol scoop_jackson 
18:19:55 <Selfie_Dad> till i had one
18:19:56 <wild_ape-style_creature> my mom's friends loved handing me their kids because they thought it was funny how horrified i was by it
18:20:02 <HellaBrad> hahaha
18:20:05 <wild_ape-style_creature> the giving danielle a baby prank
18:20:07 <Selfie_Dad> you are broken of that very quickly

18:20:31 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i guess the psychos or people w/o consciences 
18:20:32 <Selfie_Dad> dont
18:20:38 <Nude_Riker> lots of people have kids and end up continuing to be like hm this was a mistake
18:20:50 <eric> olliecam

18:29:18 <HellaBrad> soft spot for the wednesday frog
18:29:25 <wild_ape-style_creature> damn i fucked up and died immediately

18:34:09 <wild_ape-style_creature> i haven't finished the ranni quest

18:35:34 <HellaBrad> hes cool
18:37:39 <HellaBrad> i'm exploring nokron rn because im stuck in the main quest
18:37:49 <wild_ape-style_creature> that's where i need to go i think
18:37:54 <wild_ape-style_creature> why are you stuck
18:37:55 <HellaBrad> like the mirror blobs, its nice to finally have a blob enemy that is easy to kill
18:38:03 <HellaBrad> the bosses have simply gotten too hard!
18:38:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> time to bird farm
18:38:51 <HellaBrad> lol i probably will have to bulk up a little bit to keep going but i figured i could do a little bit of that organically by exploring this zone
18:39:15 <HellaBrad> the enemies here are pretty low on runes tho
18:40:03 <wild_ape-style_creature> what level are you
18:41:02 <wild_ape-style_creature> ew eric the potato guy talking about learning some dumb shit from bezos
18:41:03 <HellaBrad> 125 :s
18:41:04 <wild_ape-style_creature> i hate him
18:41:06 <wild_ape-style_creature> i hope he loses
18:41:09 <wild_ape-style_creature> my roommate is also 125
18:41:23 <wild_ape-style_creature> he's fighting mohg
18:41:29 <eric> yeah he was bad before but that really made him iredeemable to me
18:42:04 <HellaBrad> mohg is a fun boss, i havent beaten him in his palace yet
18:42:08 <wild_ape-style_creature> he reminds me of joseph gordon levitt a bit
18:42:15 <wild_ape-style_creature> third rock era
18:42:21 <eric> when he said that it really made me think this was more of an interview for him 
18:42:25 <wild_ape-style_creature> lmao
18:42:27 <wild_ape-style_creature> it definitely is
18:43:10 <wild_ape-style_creature> imagine being the guy who fucks up potatoes
18:43:44 <alansmithee_> i hate mohg
18:44:10 <alansmithee_> maybe i need to level i'm not 125, think i'm only around 110
18:45:13 <eric> yeah he was so annoying about it too
18:45:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> i really don't lik eth ebig guys in the capital with the horn helmets and weapons
18:45:26 <eric> liek he kept talking crap about innovating 
18:45:28 <eric> waht a loser
18:45:31 <wild_ape-style_creature> lmao
18:45:55 <scoop_jackson> is there a level cap?
18:46:08 <alansmithee_> i don't think so? 
18:46:22 <alansmithee_> maybe if you got every stat to 99 but i can't imagine what xp that would take
18:47:50 <eric> level 79 need 1,021,270 runes
18:48:08 <eric> The highest level possible, when all eight stats are at 99,  is 713. Requiring a grand total of 1,692,558,415 Runes.
18:48:57 <wild_ape-style_creature> lol
18:50:32 <wild_ape-style_creature> thanks peter https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/y7qDS12H/20220320_145014.jpg
18:50:50 <dreddybajs> dog ahead
18:51:31 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm glad the awful potato guy is gone
18:56:10 <wild_ape-style_creature> i'm level 99

19:03:10 <HellaBrad> getting to 100 always lets me down in fromsoft games because i feel like i should be strong enough to win by that point
19:03:55 <HellaBrad> too trained by years of pokemon as a child i guess
19:05:29 <HellaBrad> but good work levelling up so much so quick, getting your last 25 levels in a day is impressive
19:07:34 <Selfie_Dad> pitt
19:07:58 <wild_ape-style_creature> i did bird rune farming and killed a lot of big guys
19:08:12 <Selfie_Dad> getting owned in the cliffbottom catacombs
19:09:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> poopim ass of buttcralp
19:12:29 <alansmithee_> i hate the entirety of caelid that whole area is like hell and the rest of the world is so nice looking
19:12:35 <Selfie_Dad> lol
19:12:46 <Selfie_Dad> alan wants all hell all the tine
19:12:48 <Selfie_Dad> time
19:13:04 <wild_ape-style_creature> i think caelid looks cool
19:13:29 <alansmithee_> it's like you're hanging out in a bunch of bucolic monet landscapes and suddenly...you're in a bosch painting or something
19:17:47 <eric> caelid is divisive 
19:18:18 <wild_ape-style_creature> oh these mirror blobs are cool
19:19:07 <alansmithee_> i mean i don't really hate it it's just such a shock. honestly the design is really cool it's just extremely jarring compared to everything else
19:21:08 <dreddybajs> i think that's intentional and really good world design, you can access it from the start but it clearly visually tells you "too scary for you right now, maybe come back later"
19:21:36 <dreddybajs> adds to the legitimate open world exploring feeling
19:28:13 <Nude_Riker> i like how in new vegas if you just dont go the direction you're supposed to from the starting town you get immediately deathclawed
19:28:25 <Nude_Riker> no indication that will happen
19:28:32 <HellaBrad> good game
19:29:09 <wild_ape-style_creature> i hate new vegas becuase  i had like 80h in it and i was doing a dlc thing and the game glitched and i was getting poisoned as soon as i reloaded my save every time
19:29:13 <wild_ape-style_creature> getting softlocked ftl
19:29:20 <wild_ape-style_creature> the backup save wsa like 6 hours behind
19:29:25 <wild_ape-style_creature> so i never bothered playing again

19:30:43 <dreddybajs> hi benjiu
19:31:42 <HellaBrad> that sucks that you got locked out, almost every part of new vegas was pretty fun to explore
19:32:07 <dreddybajs> yeah, i loved that game
19:32:08 <wild_ape-style_creature> yeah i wsa having fun until then
19:32:13 <antiracist_baby> nvm
19:32:17 <wild_ape-style_creature> new vegas 2 is going to suck ass
19:32:36 <alansmithee_> i actually missed entirely on new vegas. played fallout 3 a ton and fallout 4 some
19:32:52 <wild_ape-style_creature> i bought new vegas for pc kind of recently because i was thinking of replaying
19:33:00 <Nude_Riker> missed the good one for the bad ones there alansmithee_ 
19:33:10 <alansmithee_> yeah that's what i've heard lol
19:33:12 <wild_ape-style_creature> fallout 3 is fun if you like goofy buggy piles
19:33:12 <Nude_Riker> oh damn you werent playing on pc?
19:33:16 <wild_ape-style_creature> nah 360
19:33:16 <alansmithee_> but i liked 3 well enough
19:33:16 <HellaBrad> yeah id recommend it, i just went back and replayed new vegas instead of playing 4 when it came out lol
19:33:31 <alansmithee_> and 4 was "fine" i kinda liked building my own city
19:33:37 <wild_ape-style_creature> and i say that sincerely, i enjoyed fallout 3 even though it was stupid
19:33:38 <Nude_Riker> theres a big mod pack that i consider essential for NV if you wanna replay
19:33:41 <wild_ape-style_creature> 4 looked like dog shit
19:33:46 <wild_ape-style_creature> sure yeah send it over
19:33:49 <Nude_Riker> really polishes the game and adds a lot of good stuff hang on

19:34:25 <Nude_Riker> https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/40040/
19:34:51 <Nude_Riker> 'LAST UPDATE ON FEBRUARY 7th 2012' damn its been a long time with this game
19:35:45 <wild_ape-style_creature> ty
19:35:51 <ajj> new vegas ftmfw
19:35:53 <Nude_Riker> i bet theres a new pack thats more updated but thats what i always play with
19:36:21 <Nude_Riker> and its pretty comprehensive
19:38:09 <Nude_Riker> frankly its been too long for me to want to dive back in and find out what Ideal New Vegas is like in 2022
19:39:22 <letty> i've started playing again but you see an area and its almost too familar you know? like its nostalgia but boredom
19:39:36 <wild_ape-style_creature> i feel like i've probably forgotten a lot of it
19:39:52 <ajj> i just mod in a sprint button cause it drives me up a wall not being able to sprint
19:39:52 <wild_ape-style_creature> or maybe i haven't and when i play i'll have the same feeling you're experiencing
19:39:58 <wild_ape-style_creature> rofl
19:40:00 <wild_ape-style_creature> good strat
19:40:25 <wild_ape-style_creature> https://twitter.com/Peter_Baugh/status/1505612365299019777 lol
19:40:56 <Nude_Riker> yeah project nevada has sprinting and it uses AP
19:43:11 <letty> is there a mod that starts you in different locations?
19:43:37 <Nude_Riker> yeah theres a bunch, with different backstories/stats and so on
19:44:12 <letty> that might be interesting
19:44:21 <Nude_Riker> i think i used this one once https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/45739
19:47:35 <letty> cheers!
19:47:52 <letty> I just want to break the pattern I seem to get into
19:48:39 <letty> like always gotta fight the powder gangers

21:28:52 <wild_ape-style_creature> i do that as well eric

21:52:26 <Selfie_Dad> eric> the thing i always do is accidentally switch my flask when im trying to switch my weapon
21:52:33 <Selfie_Dad> u should add ur flask to the quick pouch
21:52:35 <Selfie_Dad> instead
21:52:44 <Selfie_Dad> that and horse i like having in the pouch
21:53:12 <eric> hmm thats a good idea
21:53:16 <eric> to have in both places
21:53:27 <eric> i have my telescope in tehre too
21:55:43 <dreddybajs> i found danzig's bedroom https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/kd1lEGPu/image.png
21:56:05 <eric> id like a big bed like that
21:56:13 <dreddybajs> .gis shaq bed
21:56:41 <eric> lol
21:57:25 <eric> .gis worlds biggest bed
21:57:44 <eric> jesus
21:58:29 <eric> womens health does not seem like a particularly body positive mag
21:59:27 <Selfie_Dad> i think if u put flask in pouch it goes out of bottom equip
21:59:31 <Selfie_Dad> but not sure
22:00:05 <eric> o
22:00:14 <eric> maybe i should just take the other flasks out since i dont use them
22:01:10 <Selfie_Dad> that too
22:01:21 <Selfie_Dad> but having flask as a quick option is nice
22:01:38 <Selfie_Dad> since switching stuff can be disastrous lol
22:08:24 <ajj> you can also hold down d-pad to switch to the first thing on your belt
22:08:50 <dreddybajs> yeah that's really nice
22:08:52 <dreddybajs> same with spells

22:20:35 <the`shima> *ps5
22:20:36 <ajj> its really funny to me elden ring pvp is basically like a bunch of people using the most broken jojo stands theey can find against each other
22:20:54 <the`shima> lol
22:22:28 <dreddybajs> yeah its really funny
22:22:32 <dreddybajs> ashes of war really changed up the pvp

22:31:49 <bonegar> i think my d&d group is nearing the end-times
22:31:55 <the`shima> Just how dumb they are when beaten 
22:32:05 <the`shima> They seem more gimmicky but stupider 
22:32:45 <bonegar> as time goes on stands make even less sense
22:33:06 <the`shima> The brothers
22:33:10 <the`shima> The sword
22:33:25 <bonegar> ya it starts out with a tarot theme
22:34:25 <ajj> yeah lol they get progressively sillier in the later parts 
22:34:26 <ajj> https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/205/571/5ca.jpg
