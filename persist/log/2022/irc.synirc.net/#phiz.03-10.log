00:38:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> yes……
00:38:17 <registered_mirc> tomato sauce with onion and garlic, also diced fire roasted tomato, seasoning salt, garam masala, sugar, bay leaf, oregano
00:38:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> come, spiders
00:38:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> from the sky
00:38:38 <registered_mirc> damn that sucks lol
00:38:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> the age of the spider is upon us
00:38:47 <registered_mirc> reminds me of a fucked up dream i had tbh
00:39:06 <registered_mirc> where a meteorite destroyed the city and unleashed all these weird bugs
00:39:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> dehumanize yourself and face to spiders
00:39:15 <registered_mirc> and the bugs were causing people to go crazy and murder and rob each other
00:39:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> that’s where covid really came from
00:39:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> you should pitch that to john carpenter registered_mirc
00:39:42 <registered_mirc> covid except it's bloodborne
00:39:49 <synGuest780> gabber up https://youtu.be/vpMc0QfOdMw
00:39:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> or david cronenberg
00:40:00 <registered_mirc> i have it written down in my dream log
00:40:02 <registered_mirc> it would be cool
00:40:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> maybe verhoeven…
00:40:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> lot of options here
00:40:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> i’d see the shit out of that movie
00:41:07 <registered_mirc> it was definitely like cosmic horror adjascent too
00:41:19 <registered_mirc> there were these like flying incense lanterns with smoke coming out of them
00:42:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/reevellp/status/1500810351192985600?s=21
00:42:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> kinda think they should just do these things tbh
00:42:39 <registered_mirc> why does russia have such a hard-on for crimea
00:42:46 <Nude_Riker> werent those the demands they had at the earlier talks too
00:42:50 <Nude_Riker> they seem reasonable
00:43:05 <registered_mirc> why should ukraine not be allowed to join a bloc tho
00:43:06 <Nude_Riker> heck before they even agreed to talks
00:43:20 <registered_mirc> i don't understand any of that shit tbh
00:43:27 <bonegar> i dont think any demands are reasonable
00:43:34 <Nude_Riker> because: russia doesnt want them to
00:43:46 <registered_mirc> oh ok
00:43:52 <registered_mirc> sign the paper ukraine
00:44:58 <the_tasteful_nerd> 7:39:16 PM <registered_mirc> and the bugs were causing people to go crazy and murder and rob each other
00:45:09 <scoop_jackson> The before demands also included demilitarize
00:45:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> this is basically cronenberg's shivers
00:45:22 <scoop_jackson> I dunno how they change the constitution
00:45:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> well crimea is very valuable territory to have for natural gas pipelines i think is the main thing but also crimea is like 90% ethnically russian
00:45:28 <synGuest780> those eastern regions as independent and actually like no seriously independent everybody fuck off would be nice cause that's makhno's turf
00:45:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> except they do violent sex instead of robbing
00:45:36 <scoop_jackson> But that doesn’t seem like something they can do easily
00:45:44 <bonegar> no such thing as ethnicity
00:45:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> hard sell there bonegar
00:46:12 <registered_mirc> the_tasteful_nerd: never seen it actually
00:46:15 <registered_mirc> i should fix that

01:31:37 <nissan_saliva> one time, on the team fortress (1) forums, there was a dude named thingonthefloor and he was eating almonds and there was a moth inside, i think about this often. a different time he tried joining the marines but had a panic attack on top of a wall and a dude yelled at him "private andy get down from there" which he did not, so then he came back to the forums to post

14:20:35 <Disco_Pope> opened twitch to see if anyone i knew was streaming and the first thing i see is a stream titled "mommy mukbang" on the front page
14:28:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> ;
14:29:46 <mpg> twitch should only be video games
14:29:55 <mpg> make another platform for everything else
14:30:12 <mpg> alas, that will never happen
14:30:33 <mpg> it's good that if you are logged in though, you can largely avoid front-page stuff
14:32:08 <Disco_Pope> i am logged in
14:32:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> no i like that theres weird stuff on twitch
14:32:23 <Disco_Pope> and yeah i think its funny
14:32:26 <mpg> well as i said, that won't change
14:32:35 <mpg> so it's both of your lucky days
14:32:59 <mpg> i, however, remain a hater
14:33:19 <Disco_Pope> mostly i have no interest in watching people play games
14:33:30 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah that too
14:33:30 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
14:33:42 <mpg> then it's good that twitch expanded
14:33:51 <mpg> so you will have something to watch on twitch.tv
14:33:59 <Disco_Pope> if i was at a friends house and they wanted to play a single player game while i watched i would just go do something else
14:34:12 <mpg> sounds cool
14:34:16 <Disco_Pope> im gonna read your books let me know when you're done
14:34:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like watching my friends play games
14:34:24 <mpg> yeah
14:34:37 <the_tasteful_nerd> sometimes maybe 
14:34:44 <mpg> there are def some games that are frustrating to watch other people play
14:34:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> but i just think most games arent very fun to watch
14:34:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> thats why theyre games
14:34:56 <the_tasteful_nerd> because theyre meant to be played
14:34:56 <mpg> but largely i like to get the joy of gaming without doing any work
14:35:12 <mpg> the sights and sounds of gaming
14:35:18 <Disco_Pope> the joy of gaming is in the playing, to me
14:35:27 <mpg> are just as important as pushing buttons yourself, to me
14:35:36 <Disco_Pope> if i just want sights and sounds i will watch a movie
14:35:48 <Disco_Pope> where, they are better done
14:35:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when i watch my roommate game we talk while he games
14:35:56 <mpg> that is surely one opinion
14:35:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's not like we're sitting in silence
14:36:07 <mpg> is it a good opinion? i amnot goig to comment on that
14:36:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> or like in voice when dreddybajs is streaming elden ring and we're all playing our own games and talking about it
14:37:05 <Disco_Pope> i think at work today i will be doing nothing as i am "waiting on a vendor"
14:37:12 <Disco_Pope> so i will play a videogame rn
14:37:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what game
14:37:18 <Disco_Pope> tarkov
14:37:23 <Disco_Pope> the only game i play now
14:37:31 <mpg> is that still a pain to get into a server?
14:37:34 <mpg> did they fix that
14:37:43 <Disco_Pope> the wait times are way better
14:37:48 <mpg> nice
14:38:02 <Disco_Pope> most of the time im into a game within a few minutes now
14:38:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> sadly i have work to do
14:38:17 <mpg> i tried to play that before but i didn't like how it felt so maybe there are some settings to mess with
14:38:34 <mpg> but i think maybe that's just how the game is, like it's supposed to be "realistic"
14:38:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i am updating contracts so people have to pay more for certain covered benefits (: and higher deductibles/out of pocket maximums (:
14:38:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> love this
14:38:44 <mpg> ugh
14:38:46 <Disco_Pope> it definitely feels a bit weird compared to other FPS, the gear and rpg skills impact your movement and stuff
14:39:08 <Disco_Pope> like your armor has movement penalties
14:39:22 <Disco_Pope> your gun stats impact how quick it moves and how much it sways etc
14:39:25 <mpg> i remember the turning was kinda weird and slow too
14:39:37 <mpg> like there was a delay, but it seemed like it was intended
14:39:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol the unarchiver on macos has added a stand w/ ukraine button
14:39:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> when it unzips something
14:40:00 <mpg> heroic
14:40:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> i guess the devs are from ukraine though so that makes sense
14:40:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> i did not know that
14:40:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
14:40:10 <mpg> if they're from there that's another story
14:40:45 <Disco_Pope> lol
14:40:52 <mpg> one of the guys on my team is in ukraine and has been obviously stressed out
14:41:06 <Disco_Pope> i would imagine so
14:41:08 <mpg> he's in the western part though which is apparantly quiet
14:41:29 <mpg> but the other day in the morning meeting he logged on and there was a siren
14:41:39 <mpg> that was rough to hear
14:43:04 <scoop_jackson> do you know what city by any chance?
14:43:19 <mpg> not off the top, and i've never asked
14:44:39 <mpg> i looked at his linked in (he's a subcontractor with Red Tag Ukraine)
14:44:47 <mpg> and based in Lviv
14:46:57 <scoop_jackson> yeah thats far to the west, well good luck to him
14:47:16 <mikev> my tax returns finally came
14:47:53 -!- Rusty [uid73303@synIRC-350B032A.hampstead.irccloud.com] has joined #phiz
14:54:13 <bonegar> anyone else noticing anything about today?
14:54:24 <mpg> yes
14:54:25 <mpg> https://twitter.com/stereogum/status/1501587836650278912
14:54:37 <bonegar> lol
14:55:15 <mikev> lmao
14:55:44 <Rusty> LimeWire AND Biggie NFTs. the dream of the 90s is alive, and it isn't fungible anymore
14:55:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> lmao
14:56:01 <scoop_jackson> lol
14:56:15 <mpg> bandcamp's web player is such a piece of shit
14:56:25 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah
14:56:36 <bonegar> they probably dont want it to be very good
14:56:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> shame theres no better way to play the stuff w/o paying
14:56:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
14:56:43 <mikev> don't worry, it's gonna be Epic soon enough
14:56:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> it would be cool if you could do like one free play of a record thru the app
14:56:58 <mpg> like if you're playing something, and you navigate away and then back
14:57:01 <the_tasteful_nerd> which would be a bit better at least
14:57:01 <mpg> it breaks
14:57:17 <the_tasteful_nerd> what do you mean, like it doesnt play anymore
14:57:24 <mpg> yeah like it gets stuck on loading
14:57:26 <mpg> happens all the time
14:57:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> hm
14:57:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> i havent had that particular problem but i dont do it much
14:57:45 <mpg> hard refresh didn't fix it this time, neither did opening the url in a new tab
14:57:56 <mpg> it happens when im listening to something and i buy it
14:57:58 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dont do this often but if i do want to listen to bc thru the web player i usually keep it open in separate browser entirely
14:58:00 <mpg> it navigates away
14:58:06 <bonegar> how would you redesign bandcamp?
14:58:15 <mpg> i wouldn't i would just fix the player lol
14:58:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dunno bc is pretty good as it is
14:58:18 <mikev> build playlists
14:58:21 <mpg> yeah
14:58:24 <mpg> playlists
14:58:26 <bonegar> i think i would make all the songs free but a robot would say "make sure to go to this bandcamp URL of the band and give them money" for every mp3
14:58:29 <Rusty> bandbus
14:58:33 <LilSwede91> i would give it a fleshy exterior
14:58:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> the app could use some playlist/better library probably
14:58:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> but yeah
14:58:50 <mikev> kuf i got my nwb and lot mass tix
14:58:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> thats a good idea bonegar
14:58:52 <mpg> an app would be great but you know they would cram bullshit into it
14:58:56 <mpg> to monetize cos, you know
14:59:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> they have an app
14:59:02 <the_tasteful_nerd> already
14:59:03 <mikev> decided i'm gonna treat myself to a decent hotel room since i'm too old to slum it anymore
14:59:06 <mpg> you know that i mean man
14:59:10 <mpg> like spotify
14:59:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> u mean like desktop?
14:59:15 <mikev> can you remind me of the one you're stayin in again?
14:59:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> unfortunately the true best way to play bandcamp stuff is to buy it, dl it, and put it in plex
14:59:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> and use plexamp, which is tight
14:59:46 <mpg> spotify is technically a web app, but i mean like, playlists, access to your own library without having to go through the site, etc
14:59:56 <mpg> yeah i should really do that i think
15:00:02 <the_tasteful_nerd> plexamp is really slick
15:00:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah ur a plex subscriber right
15:00:17 <mpg> yeah
15:00:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> thats the way
15:00:29 <the_tasteful_nerd> i use plexamp for stuff that isnt available on spot
15:00:31 <mpg> i have a music library in plex already
15:00:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah just dl the app then and ur golden
15:00:44 <mpg> huh cool
15:00:52 <mpg> thansk for the tip
15:00:58 <the_tasteful_nerd> they dont advertise it much
15:00:59 <bonegar> plex library powered by sonos
15:01:02 <the_tasteful_nerd> because its just for pass people
15:01:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> actually its the other way around bonegar
15:01:23 <bonegar> sonos powered by ple
15:01:24 <bonegar> x
15:01:43 <mpg> my friend put out a good ambient record
15:01:43 <mpg> https://ourholyfamily.bandcamp.com/album/the-invincible-reversal
15:01:52 <the_tasteful_nerd> they should make all BC dl's free but if you dont pay for it it overlays the trap-a-holics guy doing drops every 60s
15:01:56 <mpg> he bites a lot of my work concepts but i dont care it's very good
15:01:56 <bonegar> my fav genre i will listen
15:02:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> im listening to funeral doom
15:02:10 <mpg> ftw
15:02:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> kind of an ambient thing
15:02:17 <mpg> funeral the win
15:05:55 <Rusty> how long till a bonzi buddy NFT
15:06:09 <Rusty> or the sexy dancing animated gif girl on your desktop

15:06:17 <bonegar> .g bonzi buddy nft
15:06:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> dancing baby
15:06:33 <mpg> ^
15:06:56 <Rusty> each of the hampsterdance gifs is now minted at .03ETH
15:07:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh no
15:07:25 <the`shima> joined a discord that alerts to when ps5s are available here...
15:07:29 <the`shima> now i just need to get lucky...
15:09:17 <bonegar> mpg, I think their second track is way better than their first one so far
15:09:24 <mpg> yeah
15:09:28 <mpg> that one is my favorite of them
15:09:39 <Rusty> how about unplugging "dis cord" from the TV... and reading  abook
15:09:40 <bonegar> extremely good. the first one i was like 'hmm not sure abut this'
15:09:57 <mpg> he's actually a very good songwriter and i wish he would focus more on that than the texture stuff
15:10:18 <bonegar> they should probably do whatever they want
15:10:22 <mpg> lol
15:10:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> god i have so much i need to do and i am having a hard time doing any of it rn
15:10:24 <mpg> i mean yeah obviously
15:11:31 <scoop_jackson> how much extra do you have to pay for a ps5 to just buy one? or are there none at all
15:11:53 <mpg> probably a couple hundred at least if you are buying from a scalper
15:11:56 <Disco_Pope> lost some nice gear because i was looking at work stuff :(
15:12:00 <bonegar> yea i'd say the first track put its weight on some sounds that really couldn't sustain it
15:12:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> u gotta sub to walmart+ or gamestop pro or w/e
15:12:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> to get access to drops
15:12:09 <scoop_jackson> your fav swiss bonegar https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1501931631740915715
15:12:19 <bonegar> lmao
15:12:20 <the_tasteful_nerd> which is like 15 bucks a month
15:12:32 <Rusty> i lucked out with a gamestop drop last year via that wario64 twitter acct, but i had to get the bundle with an extra controller & miles morales
15:12:42 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah thats what i did too rusty
15:12:43 <Rusty> and like, a $20 gamestop gift card. (cool, thanks, nice)
15:12:54 <bonegar> the bank of banks
15:12:56 <mpg> i will simply wait
15:12:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> except mine also came with call of duty: cia edition
15:13:01 <bonegar> me, inventing the bank of bank of banks
15:13:03 <mpg> being that my pc is fuckin bad ass
15:13:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my pc is also bad ass
15:13:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> but yeah i just sorta clicked on the link figuring i wouldnt get anything and ended up grabbing it
15:13:29 <Rusty> .y slurf song live in dublin
15:13:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it seems like it would be easier to get a new gpu than to get a ps5 right now
15:13:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> which is insane
15:13:48 <mpg> yeah that is def nuts
15:13:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dunno about that
15:13:55 <bonegar> the third track is pretty good so far too mpg
15:14:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> my pc is not bad ass, but my ps5 also cost less than whatever a good gpu is these days
15:14:04 <mpg> glad you are enjoying it
15:14:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i mean you can definitely buy current gen gpus for like 800 dollars
15:14:11 <mpg> i'll be sure to let him know, bonegar approves
15:14:14 <bonegar> this is mostly what i listen to, it feels weird
15:14:16 <bonegar> well please dont
15:14:28 <bonegar> well you can say someone really liked safe jump and empty low i guess if you wanted
15:14:42 <mpg> i was kidding i would never blow up your spot.
15:14:44 <mpg> i know better
15:14:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> newegg shuffle has been paused for some reason but you can buy the gpus for an insane markup 
15:14:49 <scoop_jackson> i mean bank of banks is a whole other thing, thats pretty common
15:14:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ps5 seems impossible to buy
15:15:00 <scoop_jackson> only one central bank of central banks tho
15:15:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> also if u buy a gpu you can just dl emulators and play whatever console (: really saving money in the long run here
15:15:17 <bonegar> for now
15:16:09 <mpg> i couldn't play ps3 emu on my last pc because i only had 4 cores
15:16:13 <the`shima> yeah you dont need to subscribe here for the drops
15:16:14 <mpg> and i guess more is recommended
15:16:25 <the`shima> just gotta be quick as fuck on spotting stock
15:16:25 <bonegar> all i know is elden ring runs fine on my 1070
15:16:28 <bonegar> that's all that matters
15:16:28 <mpg> haven't tried on the new one but i imagine it will be bad ass
15:16:38 <the`shima> i still need to decide what game to get with it lol
15:16:43 <bonegar> emulation rules tho, but i dont think ive emulated anything new
15:16:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i want to steal anohter switch game
15:16:45 <the`shima> leaning towards gran turismo
15:16:57 <mpg> stealing switch games rocks

15:18:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Disclaimer: This game does not contain watering cans, shipping containers, incessant gifting, mayonnaise machines, and endless walking.	
15:19:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm going to go active
15:19:11 <the`shima> its my own fault for running ds3 and ds in so many stupid ways lol
15:19:11 <mpg> i'm sure whatever choice you make will be epic
15:19:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this shit is WESTERN
15:19:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> get out of here
15:19:35 <mpg> lol
15:19:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wonder if it'll be any good
15:20:43 <mikev> mayonnaise machines
15:21:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you put egg in the mayonnaise machine to make mayonnaise
15:21:28 <Rusty> .y opie anthony hey masturbator

15:23:20 <the_tasteful_nerd> .qs pumpkin
15:23:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> not my thing
15:23:25 <the_tasteful_nerd> .qs pumpkin
15:23:32 <bonegar> *making note of 'burly chest'* got it.. was this chest exposed in any way?
15:23:33 <mpg> weird to imagine wayfinder coming to irc
15:23:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i really would like a jp country life sim
15:23:45 <bonegar> .gis burly chest
15:23:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> which is WHY!!! i am so excited about boku no natsuyasumi receiving an actual eng translation for the first time
15:24:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> even though it's just summer vacation sim
15:24:04 <bonegar> 'nice burls babe' 
15:24:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i want a game like uhh
15:24:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> little forest
15:24:08 <bonegar> cool thing to say
15:24:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if you have seen the movies/read the manga
15:24:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> little forest is ftw
15:24:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> the`shima> is there a ps5 game thats regarded as being the best demo of its capabilities atm? like something which just looks a jump above. otherwise ill just do cheap upgrades on ff7r and death stranding if they're available
15:24:33 <the_tasteful_nerd> probably gt7 really
15:24:40 <mikev> https://i.gyazo.com/b812a6c8dbe5dbda38756bda2ffce2a8.png
15:24:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> living in the countryside, farming, cooking, foraging, becoming bros with your ancient neighbors
15:24:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> cozy
15:24:55 <the`shima> yeah
15:25:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> the spider-man game looks pretty good too but if you've played one of those games u've basically played em all
15:25:01 <alansmithee_> gt7 starts with a 10 minute cut scene you can't skip
15:25:11 <mikev> as it should be
15:25:18 <the`shima> plus i need gt7 as a guy who is unironically aiming to be an amateur race driver lol
15:25:31 <the`shima> i'm getting there with the karting now...
15:25:32 <the_tasteful_nerd> shrimp1989dspinfo> also if u buy a gpu you can just dl emulators and play whatever console (: really saving money in the long run here
15:25:42 <the_tasteful_nerd> well i'd also have to buy all the other computer components too, so , no
15:26:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> really sad that you don't see the benefits of having an epic gamer rig you can do literally anything with...
15:26:07 <the`shima> the elite lap time last week at the track was 32.6 seconds and i did a 33.4
15:26:12 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dont
15:26:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> what would i do with it
15:26:32 <the_tasteful_nerd> sit around dicking about in python scripts to make the bot better
15:26:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> play 15 year old games like the rest of us, duh
15:26:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> just like i am now
15:26:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> also that, yes
15:26:43 <the`shima> being within a second of dudes who race semi professionally feels good
15:26:49 <the`shima> but now is the hard part as its harder to find gains now
15:27:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> hmm doesnt seem like a good use of 2 grand to me
15:27:46 <the_tasteful_nerd> if i had 2 grand just lying around i'd get this https://www.titan.fitness/strength/specialty-machines/upper-body/functional-trainer/400883.html
15:28:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i appreciate your dedication to insane workout machines
15:28:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they're probably fun to use
15:28:43 <mikev> i gotta make brakfast and go to gym
15:28:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> i should get this instead though
15:28:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> https://www.titan.fitness/strength/specialty-machines/upper-body/plate-loaded-functional-trainer/400868.html
15:28:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> since its much cheaper
15:28:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> 1.5 weeks until rune factory 5 comes out!!!!!!!!!!
15:29:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> idk why they're releasing this on a tuesday
15:29:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> and then i could preorder this https://www.getrxd.com/xebex-fitness-xt3-sled-bundle.html
15:29:27 <mikev> da rune manufacturer
15:29:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> for less than the cost of the one functional trainer
15:30:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> i was looking at getting a regular ass sled but once u add all the handles and attachments and shit its basically the cost of that high tech gadget anyway
15:30:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> neat
15:30:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> how do you find these machines
15:31:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> i keep an eye out on trusted mfgrs
15:31:08 <the_tasteful_nerd> and im in the homegym discord
15:31:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's cool
15:31:57 <bonegar> what does mfgr mean
15:32:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> maufacturer
15:32:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i assume
15:32:15 <bonegar> ...where does the g come from then though
15:32:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dunno i didnt make up the abbreviation
15:32:44 <alansmithee_> mpg how do you actually get to radahn? 
15:32:51 <bonegar> why's the g there
15:32:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> you're asking the wrong person
15:33:04 <alansmithee_> i have the checkpoint near him where they're chanting for the festival 
15:33:21 <bonegar> they got a g in there
15:33:50 <bonegar> .g why is there a g in mfgr
15:35:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> straight dope message board
15:35:24 <bonegar> lol
15:35:42 <the_tasteful_nerd> SICK! that's DOPE
15:35:52 <bonegar> my theory: someone really hot or important made a typo and everyone went with it
15:36:48 <scoop_jackson> probably the germans or brits fault or something
15:37:18 <bonegar> manufacturinger
15:37:34 <mpg> alansmithee_: you have to start "the festival" which i guess there's a couple ways but the way i ended up with was travelling to the Grand Lift
15:37:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol walgreens is yelling at me to pick up my rx or they will throw it away in 5 days
15:37:47 <mpg> you need two halves of the medallion though

15:51:00 <registered_mirc> still thinking about how amazing this is

16:09:53 <Rusty> Grimes & Elon Musk Secretly Had Another Baby Named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk
16:10:19 <bonegar> can we just continue to keep that a secret

16:11:00 <bonegar> speak of the devil
16:11:43 <this_fellow_kermit> https://joylesseuphoria.bandcamp.com/album/silent-night-of-ravishing-love?from=hp good song in a genre i usually consider 'gay' (blackgaze)
16:13:22 <bonegar> the gay genres
16:13:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Exa is a reference to the supercomputing term exaFLOPS (the ability to perform 1 quintillion floating-point operations per second). Dark, meanwhile, is “the unknown. People fear it but truly it’s the absence of photons. Dark matter is the beautiful mystery of our universe.” She texts me a voice memo with the pronunciation of Sideræl—“sigh-deer-ee-el”—which she calls “a more elven” spelling of 
16:13:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> sidereal, “the true time of the universe, star time, deep space time, not our relative earth time.” It’s also a nod to her favorite Lord Of The Rings character, the powerful Galadriel, who “chooses to abdicate the ring.”
16:13:57 <bonegar> really want to continue to keep this a secret
16:15:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo>     I mean, when people say I’m a class traitor that is not… an inaccurate description. I was deeply from the far left and I converted to being essentially a capitalist Democrat. A lot of people are understandably upset… But at the same time, like, bro wouldn’t even get a new mattress… Bro does not live like a billionaire. Bro lives at times below the poverty line. To the point where I was like, can we not 
16:15:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> live in a very insecure $40,000 house? Where the neighbors, like, film us, and there’s no security, and I’m eating peanut butter for eight days in a row?
16:15:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
16:16:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> referring to elon musk/the father of her children as bro
16:16:28 <Disco_Pope>  I was deeply from the far left and I converted to being essentially a capitalist Democrat.
16:16:35 <registered_mirc> lmao
16:16:36 <registered_mirc> Bro
16:16:43 <registered_mirc> all of that is completely fucking insane
16:16:49 <registered_mirc> but i am not allowed to say that am i
16:16:51 <this_fellow_kermit> she is incredibly stupid it seems like
16:17:07 <registered_mirc> yeah
16:17:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> she's psycho and dumb as hell
16:17:25 <registered_mirc> like the kind of stupid that isn't aware of how stupid she is
16:17:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo>     We keep having this conversation where E’s like, “Are you real? Or are we living in my memory, and you’re like a synthesized companion that was created to be my companion here?”… The degree to which I feel engineered to have been this, like, perfect companion is crazy… Even just studying astrophysics and neuroscience. And it’s really annoying because people think I’m an airhead who went to art 
16:17:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> school.
16:17:40 <mikev> like, bro
16:17:46 <scoop_jackson> lol
16:17:50 <Disco_Pope> being rich makes you dumb
16:17:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> she was dumb before she was insanely loaded
16:18:00 <registered_mirc> lmao
16:18:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> remember her stupid trash boat
16:18:19 <registered_mirc> "studying astrophysics and neuroscience" is the classic for dumb people trying to act smart
16:18:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yep
16:18:31 <Disco_Pope> yeah but she has gotten dumber lol
16:18:44 <bonegar> she sucks
16:19:04 <bonegar> sorry to your 10 years ago
16:19:05 <Disco_Pope> the last two singles were really bad
16:19:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> all her shit is bad
16:19:18 <Disco_Pope> i like a lot of her music...
16:19:20 <this_fellow_kermit> she should become bimbofied
16:19:23 <this_fellow_kermit> i think that would be cool
16:19:27 <registered_mirc> "people think I’m an airhead who went to art school"
16:19:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hm
16:19:29 <registered_mirc> i think this
16:19:29 <bonegar> think that already happened
16:19:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> thinking about the greatest gamer song
16:20:06 <bonegar> just very nerdy in that specific canadian way
16:20:07 <registered_mirc> oblivion was a pretty good song but that's about it
16:20:39 <scoop_jackson> i didnt really even like oblivion 
16:20:44 <Disco_Pope> this is two secret celeb babies in two days, pretty clear whats going on
16:20:51 <registered_mirc> its good, but i wouldnt even say it slaps
16:20:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they used a surrogate this time
16:20:54 <registered_mirc> just a decent tune
16:20:54 <bonegar> no opinion really
16:20:55 <Disco_Pope> *stories
16:20:58 <bonegar> of the music
16:21:17 <registered_mirc> decent in like a naive music kind of way
16:21:31 <bonegar> just kinda boring music like dua lipa and all that stuff to me
16:21:45 <Disco_Pope> lmao registered_mirc are you calling grimes outsider art
16:21:52 <registered_mirc> absolutely not
16:21:59 <Disco_Pope> what does naive music mean
16:21:59 <registered_mirc> how did you even get to that
16:22:00 <the`shima> does anybody know how to stop youtube from doing pop out videos its doing my fucking head in lol
16:22:15 <Disco_Pope> how did you get it to start doing that
16:22:16 <bonegar> there's definitely a naieve element to her stuff
16:22:29 <registered_mirc> it means being able to make a basic tune without any real knowledge of music theory
16:22:29 <the`shima> i didnt it just started doing it
16:22:45 <the`shima> whenever i load a tune and then jump to a window its auto popping out i nthe bottom right of the screen
16:23:15 <Disco_Pope> ok well outsider art would be without training/knowledge of theory so i think what i said is not a stretch wrt interpreting that
16:23:28 <registered_mirc> whatever you want man
16:24:32 <bonegar> finally, wants will be met
16:25:44 <registered_mirc> matt was trying to bust me based on what i said before about the outsider word
16:26:00 <registered_mirc> which is a wack ass thing to do but i hand wave
16:26:07 <Disco_Pope> im not trying to bust anyone, that was how i interpreted your statement
16:26:16 <Disco_Pope> and i think it was reasonable given what you meant
16:26:23 <bonegar> wanting, busting, wanting, busting
16:26:31 <bonegar> wantin n bustin
16:26:36 <registered_mirc> yeah well i interpret that as something else
16:26:42 <registered_mirc> and it's not very nice
16:26:52 <bonegar> the mean intepreter
16:27:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> let's just agree that grimes sucks
16:27:10 <registered_mirc> i think we do
16:27:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> uhne
16:27:29 <Rusty> everyone knows for the first baby you post a nude pregnancy pic on instagram, and the second one you just never tell anyone
16:27:40 <the`shima> what was it her latest album had track titles from
16:27:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> she had a surrogate
16:27:44 <the`shima> was it berserk or something
16:27:47 <the`shima> i cant remember
16:27:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> crymes
16:27:50 <bonegar> lol did she really
16:27:51 <bonegar> lol
16:27:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ya
16:28:00 <registered_mirc> that's called Fan Service right
16:28:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> There’s been no previous announcement about Grimes and Musk’s daughter, and they kept her birth a secret. You haven’t seen any recent pictures of a pregnant Grimes because the couple used a surrogate. Vanity Fair writer Devin Gordon only learned of the baby’s existence because she started crying during the interview. 
16:28:25 <bonegar> vanity fair
16:28:29 <bonegar> fucking hate those guys
16:28:36 <Rusty> Danity Kane
16:28:39 <registered_mirc> vanity fail
16:28:54 <bonegar> leave it to england style people to celebrate sins
16:29:11 <the`shima> oh it was Death Note
16:29:25 <the`shima> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzPElFdxMCM
16:29:30 <Disco_Pope> her last album did not have berserk titles
16:29:49 <bonegar> uhg
16:29:53 <the`shima> have you atched jojo matt
16:30:00 <bonegar> i dont want to think about grimes anymore
16:30:06 <Disco_Pope> she did do a tiktok in front of a pic of griffith tho
16:30:12 <the`shima> the voice actor for ryosuke is one of the big villains in it and it makes me laugh all the time
16:30:30 <Disco_Pope> yeah the`shima i have seen most of jojo
16:30:35 <the`shima> ftw
16:30:42 <the`shima> im in season 3 now
16:30:59 <Disco_Pope> season 3 ftw
16:31:04 <bonegar> stardust crusaders is like... peak jojo but also not my fav
16:32:09 <bonegar> i never finished stone ocean, i should 
16:32:19 <Disco_Pope> i should just start watching golden wind instead of trying to finish diamond is unbreakable again
16:32:22 <bonegar> but its also kinda boring like diamond is unbreakable
16:32:30 <bonegar> yea
16:32:39 <bonegar> i'd say go straight to golden wind
16:32:53 <Disco_Pope> im assuming the`shima meant stardust but wikipedia calls diamond s3
16:32:55 <Disco_Pope> which is wrong
16:33:01 <bonegar> diamond is unbreakable is very boring
16:33:05 <Disco_Pope> ya
16:33:09 <the`shima> i just met Steely Dan
16:33:25 <Disco_Pope> yeah you're in stardust
16:34:20 <NORG> wuzzahhhh :) :)
16:34:49 <Disco_Pope> fucked up that its thursday already
16:34:54 <bonegar> i never finished reading steelball run, and never got into jojolion subsequently 
16:35:16 <Disco_Pope> i started reading steel ball but i stopped due to being distracted
16:35:21 <bonegar> yea
16:35:26 <bonegar> it just kinda never kept my interest
16:35:52 <NORG> grimes ftw
16:35:56 <bonegar> lol
16:35:59 <Disco_Pope> i was enjoying it i just cant continue watching or reading most things

16:36:12 <Disco_Pope> i havent read a berserk chapter in months even though i was loving it
16:36:15 <NORG> i binged through 31 eps of monster in like 4 days a while ago
16:36:17 <NORG> and then just stopped
16:36:19 <NORG> no reason
16:36:23 <bonegar> beserk kinda like... idk
16:36:27 <bonegar> i think that happens to everyone
16:36:31 <Disco_Pope> im still all the way back in 250
16:36:32 <the`shima> i wanna watch monster just cause i heard some david sylvain tracks from it
16:36:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> monster ftw
16:36:37 <bonegar> they go on a boat then nothing happens then the guy who made it dies
16:36:43 <Disco_Pope> :(
16:36:44 <NORG> u should watch it dan it's cool
16:36:56 <the`shima> v cool music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruQsv709MA0
16:37:05 <bonegar> urasawa rules but i somehow never watched monster
16:37:09 <NORG> theres like 40 eps in the middle where it's the dexter meme "they got him. edit; no they didnt"
16:37:12 <Disco_Pope> i want to start reading chainsaw man but again im going to end up 20 chapters in and forget to keep going
16:37:12 <bonegar> i should probably watch that
16:37:18 <registered_mirc> .y fennesz david sylvian
16:37:19 <bonegar> i liked pluto and 20th century boys and billy bat
16:37:21 <bonegar> billybat ftw
16:37:28 <bonegar> billybat is just so fucking bonkers
16:37:31 <Disco_Pope> i think the only manga ive read the entire run of is bartender
16:37:41 <bonegar> probably the most divisive urasawa but my fav
16:37:48 <NORG> i think dragon ball is the only thing ive read front to back
16:37:59 <bonegar> norg like 1-12 or the whole run

16:39:27 <bonegar> i would if i wanted to
16:39:39 <Disco_Pope> i probably wont and people will be pouty about that
16:39:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> being forced to hang out with coworkers after work seems insane to me
16:39:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i keep my work life and personal life as separate as possible
16:39:56 <bonegar> i think that's the norm for most people
16:40:02 <bonegar> most people only have work friends and work family

16:44:01 <bonegar> i guess i could set aside two of the eggs to be unboiled
16:44:09 <bonegar> i dont like omlettes unfortunately
16:44:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> put an egg on a burger
16:44:38 <Disco_Pope> pretty good https://ayy-g.bandcamp.com/track/kehna-hi-kya-a-gs-vip-remix
16:44:42 <bonegar> i dont eat hamburger also and i promise i am not trying to be difficult about this
16:44:44 <eric> hide the egg in a baked good
16:44:49 <Disco_Pope> you could put the egg in a soup
16:44:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh i don't think you are dw
16:44:54 <bonegar> well i will eat a hamburger maybe like at a mcdonalds or a bbq
16:44:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't know what you eat! it's fine
16:45:12 <bonegar> what kind of soup?
16:45:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> egg drop
16:45:21 <Disco_Pope> i dunno sometimes ill crack an egg in a soup
16:45:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ramen
16:45:33 <bonegar> i was thinking i could fry it and put it on rice, but that always needs something else. i guess i could put shrimp on there...
16:45:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm trying to think of all the things i've seen my roommate do with eggs
16:45:51 <Disco_Pope> .g ways to eat eggs
16:45:53 <scoop_jackson> put it in a ramen soup
16:46:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> preferred egg way
16:46:10 <bonegar> what kind of ramen are we talking about
16:46:37 <Disco_Pope> many
16:46:43 <eric> .gis best way to eat egg
16:46:50 <bonegar> maybe i'll throw the two eggs at something i dont like
16:47:08 <Disco_Pope> someone got mad at me for gatekeeping goat milk the other day because i couldnt tell her what kind of goat milk i bought when i said i liked goat milk
16:47:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ..
16:47:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what

16:47:40 <eric> give them back to the chicken
16:47:45 <Disco_Pope> on twitter, i dont see people face to face
16:47:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> e
16:47:52 <bonegar> can we bring back microaggressions (I know they never left but the phrase did)
16:47:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm really glad i don't know anyone who would say these words sincerely or accuse me of these things because i could just not take them seriously ever at all
16:48:07 <eric> yes
16:48:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> tfw u gatekeep the goat milk
16:48:19 <eric> fortuantely ive never been confronted with that outside the realm
16:48:25 <Melber> hey will do you think you will want to go to farmers market saturday morn
16:48:37 <eric> though sometimes i kind of get the vibe someones about to say some wack online stuff
16:48:37 <the_tasteful_nerd> do you think that will be very fun while its raining
16:48:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
16:48:39 <bonegar> unfortunately i think a lot of people are like that, and i have met many people like that, and it's probably part of the reason i dont like being around people
16:48:49 <eric> but holster it

16:49:04 <Melber> oh damn its supposed to start fri night huh

16:50:10 <Melber> i guess i have enough bones for dog
16:50:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> Bonez 4 Dog
16:50:23 <Disco_Pope> hm that means it will be muddy on sunday for hiking bleh
16:50:33 <the_tasteful_nerd> .y muscles for bones
16:50:37 <the_tasteful_nerd> no
16:50:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> .y tim and eric muscles for bones
16:51:01 <eric> yes i feel like trying to own them on their own terms is a high difficulty manouver 
16:51:08 <Melber> im going to be watching a lot of DIY videos in the next couple weeks i think
16:51:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> the weather on saturday is "fail" as the kids say
16:51:19 <Disco_Pope> what are you trying to diy
16:51:24 <eric> so i dont care about that crap is the correct response
16:51:26 <the_tasteful_nerd> so trying to figure out Indoor Shit to do
16:51:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> "who cares" is the most effective strat because they don't expect that and generally can't respond well
16:51:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because they assume you'll care
16:51:52 <the_tasteful_nerd> its a shame cause matt's suggestion of zoo is a good one
16:51:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but you know what? i don't give a shit and it's epic
16:52:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> but i guess we'll have to come back sometime for that one
16:52:02 <Melber> will: for ollie, check out https://www.portdiscovery.org/
16:52:06 <bonegar> what are we not caring about again?
16:52:08 <Disco_Pope> yeah zoo in the cold ass rain is unfortunately bad
16:52:11 <eric> yeah online everyone has to care because otherwise it isnt real
16:52:12 <scoop_jackson> its way easier for me to get upset online than in real life
16:52:17 <the_tasteful_nerd> oh yeah i remember reading about that
16:52:22 <eric> but in real life, discourse is the least real thing there is
16:52:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i simply don't look at things online that will make me upset
16:52:28 <eric> even a pile of dirt or a rock is more real
16:52:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ^
16:52:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> maybe we can do that for a bit, and then like plop at a brewery or something for an hour before heading home
16:52:48 <bonegar> rock discourse
16:52:49 <Disco_Pope> im guessing oll-dog has no interest in museums
16:52:52 <the_tasteful_nerd> i should check whats up at sapwood
16:52:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah hes too young for that crap
16:54:06 <Disco_Pope> the problem with going to the grocery store at noon is the chickens will be from yesterday

16:57:59 <Melber> Kids are welcome but must remain seated at your table. Adult Swim (21+) starts at 8PM.
17:00:29 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah i mean that would be a moment to deploy ipad
17:01:48 <eric> use ipad to stun child 
17:02:11 <bonegar> lol
17:02:31 <Melber> yeah but they have like skee ball and shit there too
17:02:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
17:02:41 <Melber> cruel to child
17:02:48 <eric> skee ball rocks
17:02:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> oh yeah u cant have skee ball and expect a kid to just watch their parents w/ arrested development use it
17:03:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> sk'ball
17:03:11 <alansmithee_> well the radahn fight is one of the dumber things in the game
17:03:23 <Melber> remain seated kid this is chuck e cheese for grown ups
17:03:31 <bonegar> getting mad at his tiny horse
17:03:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> take ollie to round1 and teach him howto play ddr
17:03:43 <alansmithee_> the horse is so ridiculous
17:03:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he needs to learn young
17:04:19 <Melber> oh also you said your friend likes nepenthe, which made me think of them for dinner maybe.  the beer is... average, i guess, but the food would be good for ollie https://www.nepenthebrewingco.com/food
17:04:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> the beers ok yeah
17:04:42 <the_tasteful_nerd> they send it here now ive had a lil bit of it
17:05:00 <Melber> yeah its nothing id buy in the store but it's a fine place to go for a bite
17:05:22 <dreddybajs> it's so funny alansmithee_ 
17:05:48 <alansmithee_> i hate fights like that. "watch a bunch of adds kill someone. try not to be one shot while doing so"
17:06:11 <alansmithee_> and it really defeats the "epic" feel when he's on a tiny horse that half the time isn't even under him
17:06:18 <registered_mirc> simply dodge perfectly all the time
17:06:22 <eric> sounds funny to me
17:06:27 <bonegar> it rules 
17:06:44 <bonegar> it's a very hard fight though, ornstein and smaugh style

17:08:38 <this_fellow_kermit> .l
17:08:57 <bonegar> makes it a lot easier
17:08:58 <this_fellow_kermit> pretty rockin album
17:09:01 <bonegar> 'easier'
17:09:09 <eric> wahts a lamp of murmuur in your opinion
17:09:24 <this_fellow_kermit> no idea
17:09:29 <mandarin_toni> .l
17:09:36 <bonegar> .g define murmuur
17:09:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> a damn cher lamp murmuur
17:09:54 <Melber> do all elden ring bosses have names that sound like sick album titles
17:10:01 <eric> more or less
17:10:08 <the_tasteful_nerd> margit isnt so cool imo
17:10:34 <Melber> margit sounds like the best drinking advice when youre hanging out with jimmy buffet
17:10:36 <eric> Margit, The Fell Omen
17:12:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> the fell omen is cool but margit sounds like a lil weiner
17:13:19 <mandarin_toni> lol is ciaran here
17:13:26 <mandarin_toni> whu didnt i know that roisin murphy has an album called Take Her Up to Monto!
17:14:46 <scoop_jackson> i liked the single on her last one a lot
17:16:17 <dreddybajs> lol
17:16:21 <dreddybajs> i didnt know that either toni
17:16:24 <dreddybajs> thats very funny
17:16:32 <mandarin_toni> i ahvent listened to her last two or three records but shes playing at a fest im going to in the summer so i guess ill listen to them
17:16:41 <mandarin_toni> i listened to this one an insane amount in like 2008 tho
17:17:00 <scoop_jackson> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyIRVa7qbPU
17:17:13 <scoop_jackson> yeah i iddnt listen to the album
17:17:14 <dreddybajs> i really liked the radahn fight alansmithee_ because it was the first time i felt like they were doing something totally new for the series, it felt like really epic and next level to me
17:17:47 <dreddybajs> and i usually just summoned at the start of the fight, then beat him up until he phase 2'd and killed them, then resumonned and fought him again
17:18:36 <alansmithee_> the goofy horse ruined a bit of the epic feel
17:18:57 <alansmithee_> also i basically summoned, hit him a few times phase 1, then phase 2 was chain summon until he was low
17:19:15 <alansmithee_> i'm just not a fan of fights like that in games where you're basically the npc watching other folks fight
17:19:39 <alansmithee_> like the idea of the fight was cool and all, the actual doing it was meh for osmething you do multiple times if you die
17:19:50 <alansmithee_> imo of course'
17:19:58 <eric> i havent done the fight so idk
17:20:13 <eric> but sounds kind of like the dreaded autoscroller
17:21:06 <dreddybajs> well you chose to do the fight like that though?
17:21:10 <dreddybajs> thats certainly not how i did it
17:22:03 <alansmithee_> i tried fighting him straight up and it was a pain. felt really random with his large aoe attacks and running all over chasing summons
17:22:48 <alansmithee_> either way its done rip to the big dude with the tiny horse

17:27:49 <eric> thank you for your service matt
17:28:12 <mandarin_toni> when you moving matt
17:28:27 <ehn> where yu moving matt
17:28:47 <mandarin_toni> back to oregon i tjhink
17:29:36 <Disco_Pope> mid may some time
17:29:45 <Disco_Pope> this weekend i will try to get a Plan together
17:31:08 <Disco_Pope> President Zelensky has survived ‘more than a dozen’ assassination attempts
17:31:08 <Disco_Pope> i dont believe it
17:31:12 <Disco_Pope> i do believe fidel survived 680 though
17:31:52 <mandarin_toni> i dont entirely see why assassinating your enemys leader is a good move
17:32:23 <eric> seems like it makes things even more chaotic and hard to manage
17:32:28 <Disco_Pope> yeah
17:32:48 <eric> the guys with the guns are still out there shooting theres just an internal powerstuggle now too
17:33:41 <ehn> if zelensky is taken out maybe a true banderite will take over and putin can go SEE
17:34:00 <ehn> instead of just a guy whos sponsored by banderites in spite of being jewish 
17:34:41 <scoop_jackson> zelensky is a soft lib you need a stalin figure in ukraine
17:34:46 <Disco_Pope> zelenskyy the champion of the jews, who called being jewish one of his crimes
17:34:53 <ehn> wiat did he really
17:34:59 <eric> i read that as an italian figure at first
17:35:08 <ehn> lol
17:35:34 <mandarin_toni> everything putin says ukraine did, they acutally shouldve done
17:35:37 <mandarin_toni> like get nukes
17:35:51 <bonegar> yea they should have joined nato and gotten nukes
17:36:00 <bonegar> if you dont you get invaded i guess
17:36:01 <ehn> hmm perhaps
17:36:08 <bonegar> hindsight is 2020
17:36:10 <Disco_Pope> i swear i read that quote but i cant find it now
17:36:18 <Disco_Pope> "thats among the least of my crimes" or something
17:36:42 <mandarin_toni> its really cool how the list of nuclear powers includes north korea, israel, pakistan, india and formerly apartheid south africa
17:36:49 <mandarin_toni> the perfect mechanism to sustain world peace
17:36:53 <eric> sounds like he might have been employing the rarely used technique known as irony
17:37:01 <ehn> i dont think SA got one but they were close with Israels help
17:37:01 <bonegar> pakistan is the one that always surpises me
17:37:04 <bonegar> then it's like oh yea
17:37:04 <mandarin_toni> jews abhor irony
17:37:39 <ehn> how you going to include north korea on that list but not america
17:37:45 <ehn> or any west europe power
17:37:47 <Disco_Pope> it was in an interview and he got defensive about it cause he's only part jewish or something
17:37:56 <mandarin_toni> i think my opinions about america are well established
17:38:13 <eric> he was trying not to center the west brenton.
17:38:20 <eric> interesting you are so keen to do so.
17:38:29 <Disco_Pope> because of the enormous amount of things using those keywords i cant find this like 5 year old article, fail
17:38:35 <bonegar> dont worry we sent kamala to poland
17:39:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i love to center the west
17:39:25 <mandarin_toni> eric when you coming over i gotta start sorting out my summer holiday dates at some point
17:39:26 <bonegar> im pretty sure the obvious ones are off the list there in regards to nukes
17:40:01 <eric> ok ill try to gigure something out soon
17:40:20 <bonegar> crowed the pot an at least one egg broke
17:40:21 <mandarin_toni> gigure
17:40:28 <bonegar> .gis gigure
17:40:55 <Disco_Pope> ok i mgoing to the store instead of continuing to fail to find this
17:41:20 <mandarin_toni> i think ill take two or three weeks off in sept but if we're not at war ill try to spend those abroad, and then two or three in june-july and spend those hiking or whatever back home
17:41:23 <Disco_Pope> scrolling mark ames timeline cause he might have RTd a thread linking to it, waste of my time
17:42:15 <mandarin_toni> lol
17:42:28 <mandarin_toni> he has not been a very interesting voice re the war
17:47:21 <ehn> pamala harris
17:48:04 <eric> i think probably the end of june
17:48:13 <eric> i can come over for a long weekend kind of deal
17:48:16 <registered_mirc> kamala scare-us
17:48:19 <eric> or a few days during the week
17:48:27 <eric> or what have you

17:49:03 <ehn> i get it 
17:49:04 <bonegar> the words remain
17:49:07 <mandarin_toni> i can take a day or two off any time so long weekend is ok whenever
17:49:09 <bonegar> but those aren't the words
17:49:28 <mandarin_toni> end of june is #1 prime holiday time here so i probably wont compete for those dates
17:49:44 <mandarin_toni> well i have 24.6. off anyway cos midsummer
17:50:17 <eric> well maybe this is a better way to look at it
17:50:31 <dreddybajs> i get the joke
17:50:33 <eric> im in paris "for good" from the 19th of may
17:50:47 <eric> but ~june 27 - april 10 i am busy for sure
17:50:57 <eric> july not april
17:51:20 <dreddybajs> Euro Eric
17:52:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> eric what are you doing for work there
17:52:24 <mandarin_toni> is that when your chateau trip is
17:52:28 <eric> yeah
17:52:48 <eric> i dont knmow yet danielle Probably just get some crappy office job like before 
17:53:25 <mandarin_toni> the midsummer weekend would be a funny time to visit helsinki cos its when everyone who has a cottage to go to leaves the city
17:53:47 <eric> also we will move into a more permanent flat towards the end of july
17:53:54 <eric> can we go to a cottage in fnalnd
17:54:39 <mandarin_toni> i have limited cottage access but sure
17:54:58 <dreddybajs> whos your cottage guy
17:55:00 <bonegar> .gis cottage in finland
17:55:03 <mandarin_toni> theres a really neat rental one in nuuksio national park that we've been to a few times
17:55:30 <bonegar> .gis nuuksio national park
17:55:31 <eric> we dont need to book anything im happy just to see helsinki and march around abog or whatever
17:55:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i want to go to the bog
17:56:09 <eric> i need to confirm dates with some other people but some time june 13 to 26 is probably ok
17:56:55 <eric> or even the week of june 6
17:57:45 <eric> really most of june is good so we can meet up somewhere or i can go to helsinki depending on war status etc
17:57:59 <mandarin_toni> i might take a week or two off in early june, or i could take 23rd june off and have a four day weekend
17:58:55 <eric> we could celebrate the queens platinum jubilee 
17:59:37 <mandarin_toni> i am operating on the presumption of not being involved in a war, as i usually do
18:00:57 <eric> i dont think i could realistically leave sara for two weeks but if you were doing a longer trip we could overlap somewhere for 5 days to a week
18:01:13 <eric> somwhere(s)

18:05:30 <mandarin_toni> that would be cool

18:05:42 <mandarin_toni> oof

18:07:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> We settle into a cozy nook off the entryway, the one room she’s had time to Grimes up with some anime-inspired decor she purchased during a wee-hours Ambien-fueled spree on Etsy. For the next four hours, as she and I split a six-pack of some local craft beer and get slowly buzzed because we’re both lightweights, Princess Mononoke glowers at me from a thin blanket behind her on the couch. Covering the floor is an 
18:07:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> enormous Death Note rug, based on a gory 2006–2007 Japanese anime TV series about a teenager who can dictate the time and manner of anyone’s death by writing it down in a book. (It’s on Netflix.) Death Note is the chief inspiration for Grimes’s recent single “Shinigami Eyes,” as well as the video costarring her pal Jennie from Blackpink. “I like making friends with demons,” Grimes chants in her 
18:07:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> demon-baby singing voice. “You need special eyes to see ’em.”
18:08:11 <ehn> ugh
18:08:17 <eric> could you maybe like some less entry level anime 
18:08:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's so embarrassing

18:09:52 <ehn> $8 per hogshead 
18:09:53 <bonegar> i think even fox news is walking back blaming brandon
18:09:54 <scoop_jackson> thats with the nj taxes to right?
18:10:03 <scoop_jackson> or i guess no taxes cuz nj
18:10:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there's a gas tax now
18:10:14 <eric> cool desk
18:10:16 <eric> looks heavy
18:10:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> went into effect a few years back
18:10:19 <scoop_jackson> lol really
18:10:55 <bonegar> is NJ one of those states where they wont let you pump your own gas for bizarre graft reasons
18:11:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it was to create jobs in the 50s
18:11:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but yes
18:11:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think the 50s?
18:11:12 <eric> i dont mind that bh
18:11:14 <eric> tbh
18:11:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah same
18:11:19 <eric> give the youngsters something to do
18:11:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it took a little getting used to but
18:11:25 <ehn> should have sent all the surplus men to korea isntead of make work
18:11:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's not even teens
18:11:30 <scoop_jackson> its off putting to me but i understand the rationale
18:11:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's sad, it's like middle aged dudes mostly
18:11:38 <scoop_jackson> i dont know if its a good policy or not
18:11:48 <bonegar> do they upcharge for it?
18:11:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no
18:12:12 <bonegar> are snacks more expensive or something
18:12:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> nj didn't get rid of toll booths during the plague either like other states have
18:12:16 <bonegar> dont understand how they pay for it
18:12:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> which i also appreciate even though those jobs sucks
18:12:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> suck
18:12:26 <scoop_jackson> gas in nj used to be way cheaper than ny bonegar because no gas tax too
18:12:29 <scoop_jackson> bonegar
18:12:31 <mandarin_toni> boll tooth
18:12:39 <scoop_jackson> i think its still cheaper
18:12:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah it is cheaper
18:12:44 <bonegar> how do they pay their lil guys tho
18:12:49 <bonegar> that money gotta come from somewhere
18:12:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it comes from the gas stations
18:13:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they are employees of the gas stations
18:13:04 <ehn> i was gunna say they have the most billionaires so they can tax them but they probably have them all there because they dont tax them
18:13:05 <ehn> hmm
18:13:09 <bonegar> not understanding this
18:13:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's not one guy per pump
18:13:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's one or two guys per station per shift
18:13:24 <scoop_jackson> how did bonegar suddenly develop neoclassical economics brain
18:13:30 <eric> lol
18:13:33 <bonegar> do you have to tip the guy?
18:13:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no
18:13:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> why would uoi
18:13:41 <bonegar> this makes no sense
18:13:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you*
18:13:46 <bonegar> i dunno how they get paid
18:13:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the same way the rest of the gas station employees get paid
18:14:06 <bonegar> How can they afford an extra guy
18:14:12 <registered_mirc> shrekonomics
18:14:21 <bonegar> some kinda RICO violation
18:14:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because tyhey make a ton of money off gas and snacks presumably
18:14:50 <bonegar> so they charge more for snacks?
18:14:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no
18:14:58 <bonegar> this is making no sense
18:15:01 <ehn> pooplunch
18:15:03 <bonegar> how do they get the people out of the car for the snacks
18:15:11 <bonegar> does the guy try to sell you snacks while he is filling up
18:15:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no
18:15:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> people go inside if they want
18:15:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like any other gas station
18:15:23 <eric> this cvould be one of those things where people say they cant do something but actually they can and its just about power
18:15:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's not like you have to enter the gas station to pay
18:15:28 <bonegar> WHILE the guy is filling u up?
18:15:31 <bonegar> do you just leave the car there
18:15:35 <eric> such as hiring another guy to help do the job
18:15:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> some people do
18:15:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but others wait
18:15:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> same as a normal gas station
18:16:04 <eric> im guessing the margins at a gas station are not as slim as in a restaurant
18:16:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah
18:16:09 <eric> but what do i know
18:16:16 <bonegar> that's what im assuming
18:16:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you can just set your gas prices at whatever price point
18:16:36 <scoop_jackson> i mean even with restaurants its not as if seattle raising minimum wage destroyed all the resturants in seattle
18:16:39 <bonegar> like grocery stores cant even afford to pay for clerks or baggers, so a gas pump guy just feels entirely unfeasable
18:16:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they can 100% afford to pay
18:16:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they choose not to
18:17:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i mean look at a grocery store like trader joes
18:17:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> theyt have a ton employees making well above minimum wage
18:17:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and it's not like their groceries are expensive
18:17:41 <eric> i subscribe to the chapo dictum that there are too many restaurants anyway
18:17:45 <scoop_jackson> you should go back to reading earnings reports bonegar where they are all talking about "yeah we were able to raise prices without lsoing business"
18:17:46 <bonegar> they only have 1 clerk and you gotta wait 20 minutes to buy your end-of-run frozen pizza 
18:17:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they definitely don't
18:17:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> not in any of the ones i've been in
18:17:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there's always a ton of people working
18:18:01 <bonegar> i hould read those reports
18:18:47 <bonegar> i understand gas is largely inelastic or w/e
18:18:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my roommate's friend makes more as a cashier at tjs than he does as a librarian
18:18:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's epic
18:19:22 <eric> it cant be any other way or we wouldnt innovate anymore
18:19:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> true
18:19:48 <bonegar> i think the last 20 years proved that not all innovation is good
18:19:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no dude innovation is great and we need more of it
18:20:12 <bonegar> 1 hacker way
18:20:14 <bonegar> 1 innovation drive

18:20:55 <bonegar> .g how new jersey pays for gas attendants
18:21:06 <eric> damn
18:21:13 <eric> thats more than i made as a diswhawaser
18:21:32 <eric> and that is definitely a harder job
18:21:41 <bonegar> lol yea
18:21:50 <eric> i guess it was like 10 years ago now that i was a dishwasher though so
18:21:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> min wage is $13/h effective 1/1/22
18:21:53 <bonegar> seems like a cushy gig tbqh but i guess breathing in exhaust all day is probably rough
18:22:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> supposed to go up to $15 in 2024
18:22:14 <eric> yeah you probably smell like gas at the endo f the day
18:22:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they're gradually raising wages
18:22:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> whihc is stupid
18:22:22 <bonegar> minimum wage is still like 7 dollars here
18:22:43 <bonegar> guess e finally go up to 9
18:22:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> nj is like one of the most expensive states to live in in the country
18:22:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> 13 is nothing
18:22:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's insane how expensive it is here
18:23:19 <bonegar> all that big pharma money
18:23:30 <scoop_jackson> i was unclear, i wasn't making a point about gas prices being more, my point is more that right now large firms in america have tremendous pricing power because there are so many quasi monopolies
18:23:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i live pretty close to a ton of pharmaceutical manufacturers
18:23:38 <scoop_jackson> *gas prices being inelsatic
18:23:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they're on the other side of the county

18:24:37 <bonegar> i guess im just  genuinely curious about the microeconomics of a new jersey gas station, but i can't imagine getting a straight answer from.. do they franchise these out? no idea
18:25:04 <bonegar> moving out east to open gas station in new jersey.. da dream
18:25:21 <scoop_jackson> yeah they franchise them
18:25:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think it's probably impossible to do this unless you have millions and millions of dollars

18:29:23 <ehn> Michael Penis
18:29:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Since, Wawa is highly popular among American households for its fresh dairy products and is highly profitable, many people want to buy a Wawa Franchise. But Wawa Inc. does not offer franchise opportunities so, you cannot open a Wawa Franchise. The company’s website clearly states that, ‘Wawa does not Franchise its stores’. As far as the cost of opening a Wawa Franchise is concerned, since, Wawa Inc. does not 
18:29:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> offer franchise, the question of How much is the cost of to open a Wawa Franchise becomes invalid.
18:29:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what fresh dairy products
18:29:49 <eric> how can people get away with using the word traumatise like that in this day and age
18:29:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i hate these stupid fake seo websites that just make search engines useless
18:30:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> are they thinking of turkey hill
18:30:21 <bonegar> pointing at the s
18:30:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> tehy have ice cream
18:30:30 <eric> pinterest is one of the worst websites for this reason 
18:30:30 <bonegar> whinging brit stirring the pot
18:30:45 <eric> pinterest has completely ruined google image search
18:30:48 <bonegar> pinterest sucks yea
18:32:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i can't ever find information i'm looking for anymore
18:32:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> all search engines suck ass
18:32:27 <eric> yeah
18:32:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ddg is my main one but i have to add -msn -yahoo with every single seatch since they pull from bing
18:32:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but now they're altering results too
18:34:21 <eric> its cool when theres a monopoly because then they can just make things worse and worse and yoiu cant do anyhting abouti t
18:34:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yep
18:34:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i love it
18:34:51 <mandarin_toni> i think for a monopoly google has always been decent
18:34:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol
18:34:57 <bonegar> kinda funny it's the natural outcome too, but it's the one thing you aren't supposed to do for this reason
18:35:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> google is definitely not decent
18:35:12 <mandarin_toni> my biggest issue is the amount of autotranslated garbage websites in finnish nowadays
18:35:31 <bonegar> things are largely unbrowsable in general
18:35:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> google has crippled browser development
18:35:47 <mandarin_toni> i dont care about that crap
18:35:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the only reason firefox is still around is to create the illusion of choice
18:36:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> their search results are dogshit
18:36:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they censor whatever they feel like
18:36:55 <Disco_Pope> i like vivaldi but its still chromium based

18:37:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah Disco_Pope that's a huge problem
18:38:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> every "alternative" is chromium-based
18:38:06 <registered_mirc> time to go to the dentist
18:38:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that is completely unacceptable

18:57:11 <Disco_Pope> any ideas on the best way for my friend to publish a small guidebook for phones? epub and pdf suck for different reasons and he wants offline capability so website isnt ideal
18:58:50 <bonegar> maybe you could get away with an offline html file idk
18:59:25 <bonegar> i think that's what project gutenberg does
19:00:15 <Disco_Pope> that works on desktop idk abotu phones
19:01:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> A conversation with Grimes can be like staring at a Tokyo subway map when you don’t speak Japanese. She’s always using scientific terms and alluding to heady concepts, then checking with me to make sure I know what they mean because usually I do not. If there’s an airhead in this room, it’s not her.
19:01:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> “Do you know what a protopia is?” No. (A state of gradual progress toward utopia.)
19:01:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> “Effective altruism?” I mean, I know what those words mean. (Using data analysis to maximize resource deployment to help others.)
19:01:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> “The Overton window?” I thought so, but I looked it up while she was in the bathroom and I was wrong. (The spectrum of accepted discourse and achievable ideas.)
19:01:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> “What about neuroplasticity?” Now I’m worried she just thinks I’m stupid.
19:02:02 <bonegar> i mean it'd look OK I guess on a phone... but maybe there's some kinda CSS for phones thing
19:02:25 <bonegar> but i realize you mean for phones now not for phones
19:03:50 <bonegar> epub is probably the way to go if they're expecting people to use e-readers on their phone to consume this

19:05:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm slowly reading through this article but i have to stop every few paragraphs because it's overwhelming
19:05:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> She knows she’s going to get slaughtered for saying this, but: “Personally, I don’t think ‘manic pixie dream girl’ is an insult. I exactly identify with all of those terms. I understand it’s supposed to be a critique of certain things, but then I challenge that critique.” 
19:07:58 <Melber> shrimp1989dspinfo: I mean Wawa's milk is all from their farms iirc
19:08:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
19:08:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> really???
19:08:09 <Melber> I have driven past the Wawa farm
19:08:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i had no idea, that's really funny
19:08:19 <Melber> It's on rt 1
19:08:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i didn't know they were Known for milk
19:08:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> got stuff for my 10th edh deck
19:08:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> woot
19:08:38 <Melber> I mean I think in the same way royal farms is
19:08:43 <Melber> Which is to say not at all
19:08:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> royal farms is known for chicken afaik
19:08:52 <Melber> But that's how they started
19:09:07 <Melber> Yes but they, too, have their own milk
19:09:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wild
19:09:27 <bonegar> in my 'why does mfgt have a g in it voice': why is it RoFo and not RoFa
19:09:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> its BoFa
19:09:53 <Melber> I think that's true of almost all those regional convenience stores
19:09:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofo confuses me as well
19:10:05 <bonegar> Why is it Ligma and not Ligmuh
19:10:34 <Melber> For a while the Baltimore arena, which sucks and is being torn down, was sponsored by royal farms and people affectionately called it the chicken box
19:10:38 <bonegar> got my thursday ponderances in, im done

20:20:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> [tune of suzanne vega - tom's diner] gay luigi gay luigi gay luigi gay luigi
20:24:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> (She dubbed herself Grimes because MySpace allowed her to associate herself with three musical genres, and she liked the name “grime,” then a nascent British music scene.) 
20:25:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> the_tasteful_nerd: how do you track shit on macrothing when you go out to eat
20:25:25 <the_tasteful_nerd> depends on where
20:25:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> For years Grimes harbored a dream of directing her own adaptation of Dune, with the more problematic colonialist elements scrubbed out, but when she heard about Denis Villeneuve’s two-part blockbuster, she fangirled all over again and signed on to help with the rollout, originally scheduled for November 2020. (“I was basically an influencer.”) And then, she adds, she got canceled from Dune because of the 
20:25:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Communist Manifesto thing. She was crestfallen, but she understood. “There are things that are deeply not woke in the Dune universe,” she says, so the studio had to be extra-cautious, and she was far from indispensable.
20:25:33 <the_tasteful_nerd> if its a chain theres a good bed somethings on there
20:25:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> if its a common dish, i just use the common dish
20:25:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> otherwise i guesstimate the amounts of the components of a dish
20:25:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> like if they have a #cal on the menu (i think they have to in new york) can i just find a generic version ofthat food and adjust until the kcal number is right
20:26:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah you could do that for sure
20:26:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> that seems good
20:26:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> also you can just quick log calories
20:26:20 <the_tasteful_nerd> if they have a cal number
20:26:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> you dont even have to put the macros in if u dont feel like it
20:26:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> so if something says its 700 cals you cna just log that
20:26:43 <the_tasteful_nerd> good enuff
20:26:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> i am finding that i am very reticent to make food in any kind of way that makes it annoying to measure
20:27:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> i had a smoothy today thats very easy to do
20:27:02 <the_tasteful_nerd> standardizing your meals a bit helps certainly lol
20:27:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> like eating the same 2 breakfasts on alternating days
20:27:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont really eat breakfast at all like 90% of the time 
20:27:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> unless sydney decides she wants to make egg sandos or we have some leftovers that seem good to eat for breakfast
20:29:28 <the_tasteful_nerd> also once you eat the same thing a few times the copy/paste function is very handy
20:29:39 <Melber> why would you scrub the colonialist parts of dune out
20:29:44 <mandarin_toni> did not know grimes is named after grime
20:29:44 <Melber> they're part of the point lol
20:30:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> like i ate a turkey sandwich in certain proportions 2 days ago, i can just go back to that day and swipe all those foods and copy, then go to the current day and paste them in today
20:30:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> i guess im going to try to make smoothies in the morning the_tasteful_nerd 
20:30:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> because its extremely easy to do
20:30:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> for the turkey sandwich i will have today
20:30:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> well ive already saved a couple of recipes that i expect we will make again
20:30:20 <ajj> smoothies were king when i was trying to diet
20:30:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> ya just standardizing your intake a bit will help w/ logging
20:30:29 <mandarin_toni> in russia every menu lists how many grams the dish weighs, and even drinks are listed in grams
20:30:31 <mandarin_toni> 50 grams of vodka
20:30:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> wow
20:30:43 <the_tasteful_nerd> another reason russia is superior to america
20:30:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean just the way that i put a smoothie together, everything goes in the nutribullet cup 1 ingredient at a time
20:30:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> so i can just have the cup on the scale
20:31:02 <the_tasteful_nerd> yup thats helpful too
20:31:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> its also easy to get a fairly filling thing out of that without too many calories
20:31:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> i will probably get on the smoothie train next time i bulk
20:31:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> most of this week i was eating leftover mac & cheese and carnitas we made which were good but like
20:31:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> for the opposite reason
20:31:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> extremely fat heavy
20:31:48 <mandarin_toni> fat is good for your hair
20:31:48 <bonegar> the point of dune is that the guys who do space drugs to do math better than computers are in in a cold war with the people who do drugs to predict the future to run eugenics programs
20:31:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> just one serving put me close to the daily fat target
20:31:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> thanks toni very helpful.
20:32:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> fat is good for a lot of things
20:32:15 <ajj> lol
20:33:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah it can be eye opening how calorie dense some things are and how little calories are in others
20:34:05 <bonegar> extracting onion fat from 10,000 old onions 'we're eating good tonight'
20:34:32 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
20:34:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> i havent hit protein or carb goal any day but i was well over on fat every day
20:35:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> protein is the important one
20:35:25 <bonegar> .g soap made from onions
20:35:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> onion soap
20:35:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> we just havent really had any protein heavy foods the last week or so
20:36:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> sydneys been busy at night and hasnt been cooking and ive just been eating leftovers, we didn't have anything else i could cook either
20:36:12 <bonegar> tfw when you find food that works for your diet and your poops become effortless and clean
20:36:33 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah
20:36:52 <the_tasteful_nerd> well i mean protein is more important in a resistance training context really when dieting
20:37:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> less so outside of that
20:37:11 <NORG> Kewl baseball is back
20:37:19 <NORG> excited to watch about a week of it, and then none until playoffs
20:37:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
20:37:32 <bonegar> werent they gonna go on strike or something
20:37:34 <Melber> hell yeah norg
20:37:40 <Melber> baseball baby
20:37:43 <bonegar> do you have a team norg
20:37:45 <NORG> the owners locked the players out bonegar
20:37:52 <NORG> coz they said they dont make enough money :'( :'(
20:37:59 <NORG> i root for the Texas by god Rangers
20:37:59 <bonegar> did they resolve that
20:38:18 <Melber> yeah a cba deal was reached
20:38:21 <NORG> most likely they just made it a future them problem and in a couple of years they'll be right back to lockouts again
20:38:43 <bonegar> i think baseball is a sport i could really get into if i had a team
20:39:17 <Melber> NL DH hell yeah
20:39:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> baseball is nice
20:39:29 <Melber> youre in omaha right bonegar
20:39:35 <bonegar> home of the college world series
20:39:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> nl dh ftl
20:39:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> the entire point of baseball is to make pitchers hit
20:39:56 <Melber> wrong
20:40:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> it is you that is wrong.
20:40:10 <bonegar> i can't stand cubs fans, and i don't like the royals
20:40:11 <Melber> i am correct
20:40:24 <Melber> only one pitcher should hit and his name is shohei ohtani
20:40:27 <NORG> i like NL DH because i like Dingers
20:40:33 <bonegar> the rockies would have to be my team
20:40:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> you would rob the people of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVFsq9FQBlc
20:40:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> you sick fuck
20:40:38 <bonegar> and i dunno if i could commit to that
20:40:45 <NORG> i would recommend not becoming a fan of baseball
20:40:49 <NORG> if that is your only team choice
20:40:55 <scoop_jackson> be a yankee fan
20:40:55 <bonegar> my actual team is the rakuten eagles
20:40:59 <Melber> why dont you like the royal
20:41:00 <Melber> ss
20:41:01 <bonegar> no such thing as a yankee fan
20:41:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> become a minor league baseball fan
20:41:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats cool to do
20:41:14 <NORG> yankee born and yankee bred and by god i'll be yankee dead
20:41:18 <Melber> well her local team is a royals affiliate 
20:41:19 <scoop_jackson> ^
20:41:31 <bonegar> yup
20:41:44 <bonegar> actually going to stormchaser games rules
20:41:50 <NORG> god the rockies are so pathetic
20:41:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> dont be a yankee fan but do get a yankee hat that you wear with a white tank top and sweatpants
20:42:00 <bonegar> but not really a thing you can do alone
20:42:11 <Melber> also bonegar you dont have to like the cubs
20:42:14 <Melber> there's always the white sox
20:42:24 <bonegar> no question white socks > cubs
20:42:32 <Melber> *sox
20:42:43 <bonegar> yeah exactly why i can't be a fan
20:42:45 <NORG> sawks
20:42:53 <bonegar> i'm not from the specific area where they allow you to be a fan
20:43:00 <Melber> https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0264/6248/6603/files/MicrosoftTeams-image_10_2000x.png?v=1644531365 this is the epitome of "baseball dude"

20:45:47 <Disco_Pope> bed bath and behind
20:45:55 <Melber> bed bath and BEHOLD
20:47:25 <bonegar> they're always giving out fidget spinners
20:48:49 <Melber> sounds like a great time to go and enjoy the sport of base ball
20:49:21 <bonegar> absolutely
20:51:03 <bonegar> i can just imagine going to one of those games, returning to my car and seeing someone has left a child on my car like a person with too many cats
20:53:55 <registered_mirc> well, my grill is as mediocre as the rest of me, but that's better than total failure
20:54:20 <registered_mirc> 4 very small cavities, and gum issues, but all expected
20:54:40 <registered_mirc> got two more appointments lined up already
20:55:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> grats
20:55:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if i have cavities i'm killing myself
20:55:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> never had a cavity in my life
20:56:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm too afraid of needles for local anesthetic and i would definitely lose my mind if i was awake during drilling
20:56:09 <registered_mirc> i suspect you take better care of your teeth than i do
20:56:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i dunno
20:56:25 <registered_mirc> already been through several hells with my mouth
20:56:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i brush twice a day, sometimes three times
20:56:39 <registered_mirc> yeah you definitely do
20:56:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no flossing though which is just as important
20:56:41 <NORG> its time to play moar dq4
20:56:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hurts my gums
20:56:47 <NORG> im at torneko's chapter 
20:56:55 <bonegar> that's where it starts
20:56:57 <registered_mirc> the dental hygienist recommended a water pik
20:56:57 <bonegar> you cant fool me
20:56:58 <Disco_Pope> i brush and floss every day but i have a bunch of cavities that need filling
20:56:59 <registered_mirc> so im getting one
20:57:10 <Disco_Pope> idk how
20:57:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> every dentist just tells me to deal with it but my mouth fills with blood whenever i floss and that's not really something i want to deal with
20:57:31 <bonegar> i dont brush every day and i've already told my cavity story
20:57:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> o_o
20:57:45 <registered_mirc> teeth.... plaque conspiracy........ metallica
20:57:54 <Disco_Pope> i asked my last dentist if i should get a waterpik and she said its a waste of money but also i dont trust her anymore so maybe ill get one
20:58:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i make my coffee or tea in the morning and then i brush after
20:58:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and then before bed
20:58:02 <ajj> lol
20:58:07 <bonegar> (((dentists)))
20:58:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if my mouth feels not great i brush in the afternoon
20:58:14 <registered_mirc> i told the lady i heard it was voodoo science and she wa slike no its great
20:58:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i always brush my teeth before i leave the house
20:58:27 <Disco_Pope> i do only brush one a day though, because like... i didnt eat anything at night why would i need to brush again
20:58:30 <ajj> i never trust my dentists when they're telling me i need the $300 Extra Strength Megapowered 500 HorsePower electric toothbrush or else my teeth will fall off
20:58:45 <registered_mirc> i refuse to discuss my brushing habits as they are shameful
20:58:46 <bonegar> dentists love to be like 'go ahead, fuck up your gums, scrub em.'
20:58:52 <bonegar> but the secret is don't
20:59:01 <Disco_Pope> i use the base model oral b electric because my mom gave it to me
20:59:01 <registered_mirc> bonegar wisdom
20:59:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> bros... please brush your teeth
20:59:52 <bonegar> whatever ive been doing has been working so im going to continue what i do
21:00:33 <ajj> i want that etched on my tombstone
21:00:48 <registered_mirc> there was also an extremely cute lady doing billing and we were talking about weekend plans and i dorked out about elden ring and then she told me she bought her bf a ps5 and i just started internally screaming
21:01:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you should go back and kill her
21:01:17 <Disco_Pope> lol
21:01:20 <bonegar> lol
21:01:33 <registered_mirc> i should go back and tell her i would never ask her to buy me a ps5 and she would instantly fall in love
21:01:42 <bonegar> saying 'my boyfriend' rules
21:01:43 <bonegar> tbqh
21:01:59 <registered_mirc> well i am glad whenever someone is happier than i am
21:02:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm not
21:02:12 <registered_mirc> but, it's fine, i have elden ring
21:02:20 <bonegar> there's a 10% chance she even has a boyfriend, and a 11% chance she knows what elden ring is
21:02:21 <registered_mirc> never truely maidenless

21:24:17 <mandarin_toni> in finland apparently almost all indoor sports arenas are too small for handball because the court is bigger than in basketball or volleyball
21:24:19 <mandarin_toni> but this random shithole town called riihimäki has a full size arena and thus superior handball facilities so they dominate the league
21:24:24 <dreddybajs> its a crazy game 
21:24:27 <mandarin_toni> also the team from riihimäki is called Cocks
21:24:31 <mandarin_toni> and their chief rival are called Dicken
21:24:44 <mandarin_toni> almost as good as the league 1 nice-brest derby
21:24:58 <dreddybajs> lol
21:25:10 <eric> lol
21:25:39 <mandarin_toni> all the headlines are always like "cocks had a firm grip on deflated dicken"

21:26:11 <mandarin_toni> idk its short for something in swedixh
21:26:11 <ehn> not much whats dicken with you

22:06:08 <dreddybajs> maybe turn motion blur off and see if it helps

22:06:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i do it in one direction so i can use my sword
22:06:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao

22:07:46 <bonegar> as if meta doesn't own both facebook and instagram, as if they arent the same people
22:07:48 <bonegar> weird wording
22:07:55 <registered_mirc> i feel really bad for all of the russian raccoon sanctuaries i follow on IG
22:07:59 <dreddybajs> the article states it's meta operations
22:08:08 <eric> damn trying to remember this posters name is going to drive me ape
22:08:09 <bonegar> thanks article guy
22:08:14 <eric> i guess ill just stop thinkgin about it and forget
22:08:18 <eric> oops i remember
22:08:18 <dreddybajs> i guess ppl still have more brand recognition with those than meta so they do that for bigger engagement
22:08:19 <eric> corsair
22:08:20 <dreddybajs> oh fuck off bonegar
22:08:26 <bonegar> hue hue hue
22:08:29 <dreddybajs> why do i bother
22:08:45 <ajj> FINALLY fucking beat godskin noble
22:08:49 <ajj> fuck that asshole
22:08:57 <dreddybajs> nice ajj , i just beat them too on my game
22:08:58 <registered_mirc> haha i did the glitch against him
22:09:02 <registered_mirc> because the fight is not fun
22:09:06 <eric> https://forums.somethingawful.com/dictionary.php?act=3&topicid=2531
22:09:15 <eric> all you need to know i guess
22:09:17 <scoop_jackson> i have 97 karma
22:09:22 <eric> good job
22:09:27 <registered_mirc> you should lose some, so you can get 69
22:09:53 <ajj> its such a tilting fight when his sword extremely visiablly clips through a pillar and kills you
22:10:12 <registered_mirc> the collission in some areas has been absolute shit and infuriating
22:10:26 <registered_mirc> like trying to go to the underground in one area where a giant is guarding outside
22:10:35 <registered_mirc> and his weapon just goes right through the walls
22:10:53 <ajj> its very aggravating because usually the game is good about making the enemies play by the same rules you do
22:11:15 <registered_mirc> well you too can hit through walls but you wont get as far in as that giant for instance
22:11:15 <ajj> but for you like, if you even slightly touch a wall your weapon goes CLANG and you're stunned for 5 seconds but enemies can just clip through walls like nobodies bizness
22:11:22 <ajj> yeah
22:11:27 <scoop_jackson> this is the only thread ive made on reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/vampires/comments/2c77nh/questions_regarding_vampires_and_fishmen_blood/
22:11:30 <bonegar> yeah the wall clipping is bad in elden ring
22:11:32 <bonegar> it kinda sucks
22:11:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/FK73riCc/image.png
22:11:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'll never know what's actually all that i need to know
22:12:02 <bonegar> im bad at gameing so my number 1 strategy is using the game geometry to cheese a fight, and i dunno how many times I just die by getting a big spear through the wall
22:12:05 <registered_mirc> it's always been kinda bad in the souls games but in ER i think some of the enemies are just so big it just clips on through
22:12:11 <eric> oh its nothing really shrimp
22:12:38 <eric> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/Fh8kpc07/image.png
22:12:45 <bonegar> i just know a big guy will be able to clip their attack through a wall at this point, but it was definitely an annoying lesson to learn
22:12:49 <registered_mirc> i think they might fix some of that but it seems like a core issue with their engine since it's always been a thing
22:12:50 <eric> time to ggo store
22:12:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> good luck eric
22:13:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> someone should tell the new sa owner that paywalling is gatekeeping

22:16:04 <scoop_jackson> all jeffreys posts about sa are super wishy washy
22:16:16 <dreddybajs> it's an optional area that i think is pretty intended for lategame registered_mirc 
22:16:18 <registered_mirc> what do you mean nic?
22:16:19 <dreddybajs> i also found it very hard
22:17:45 <scoop_jackson> im trying to think of an example mpg but its more a trend- hes very absent owner, super positive then when someone in a thread asks a legit questions he dodges and goes on about how it will all work out
22:17:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> .l

22:18:48 <registered_mirc> i guess you are still a pretty regular poster?
22:19:03 <registered_mirc> i bounced off a while back because i just started getting annoyed by SA
22:19:10 <registered_mirc> the only thing i read now is the yospos pics thread
22:19:18 <registered_mirc> which is really good
22:19:34 <registered_mirc> except when they start talking about music then i just roll my eyes a lot
22:19:48 <scoop_jackson> i read the worst forum

22:20:49 <registered_mirc> and be sure to pop a gold foot
22:20:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i just run in circles around them on my horse
22:20:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they don't get me
22:21:22 <registered_mirc> i go metal gear on them and sneak up and smash them with a back stab
22:21:25 <scoop_jackson> some of my best friends are bots
22:21:27 <scoop_jackson> i'm drunk
22:21:35 <registered_mirc> feels especially good because they are assholes
22:21:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'll try that

22:23:26 <registered_mirc> i did not click through to check the date because i dont care enough
22:23:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but he had a tiny sliver of health left
22:23:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and almost killed me rofl

22:50:41 <registered_mirc> i only have one monitor.
22:50:45 <registered_mirc> i only need one
22:50:45 <ajj2> this technically a Health Purchase since im not smoking anymore 
22:50:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> :/ how could oyu
22:51:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> simply lol if your desk doesn't look like an insane battlestation
22:51:12 <registered_mirc> i game in windowed mode too >:)
22:51:16 <ajj2> lol
22:51:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i do that
22:51:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> not for elden ring but for most of my games
22:51:33 <registered_mirc> cool we're still homies then right?
22:51:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> buy a second monitor
22:51:45 <registered_mirc> i dont have space for it
22:51:53 <registered_mirc> my work computer is on the desk next to me
22:51:58 <registered_mirc> with a monitor
22:52:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my setup is whatever i'm watching on one monitor, gaming on the other monitor, irc on my laptop
22:52:07 <ajj2> thats ftw
22:52:08 <registered_mirc> so i don't code on two monitors either, and everyone thinks i'm nuts but
22:52:16 <ajj2> i dont have a desktop sadly just a laptop 
22:52:16 <registered_mirc> that's silly, because i am extremely productive regardless
22:52:50 <dreddybajs> registered_mirc: you can get a switch to swap both monitors from pc to pc
22:52:54 <dreddybajs> im sure you know this but, just in case
22:52:58 <registered_mirc> yes i do know this.
22:53:58 <eric> i hope one day to have three monitors
22:54:19 <eric> I guessi dont need it but i want it
22:54:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have two 27" monitors and i think they're too big
22:54:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but what can you do
22:54:41 <scoop_jackson> id like a command center with a hundred monitors full of charts
22:54:44 <registered_mirc> one day i might get into two monitors. i have to see how it shakes out when i get a new apt in the clouds
22:54:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> 5:46 PM <ajj2> oh that link doesnt work at all
22:54:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> yes that link did work
22:54:57 <registered_mirc> shrimp1989dspinfo: i have one enormous curved 32"
22:54:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> you should get into mtg ajj2
22:54:57 <ajj2> cool
22:55:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> jesus
22:55:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> mtg ftw
22:55:29 <registered_mirc> yeah it's huge and a big reason why i don't need 2 monitors
22:55:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> and commander, the best format, ftw.
22:55:42 <ajj2> i tried arena for a little bit but i wish they had the fun formats that people actually play
22:55:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> well they have standard
22:55:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> and limited
22:56:07 <registered_mirc> elden ring is currently in 2048x11152 in a window lol
22:56:11 <registered_mirc> plenty of resolution
22:56:20 <registered_mirc> *1152
22:56:21 <ajj2> im busy playing Yugioh the real card game for mental children
22:56:27 <registered_mirc> lol
22:56:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> but yeah the arena version of commander isnt very good and really doesnt have the spirit of the game since you only have access to a very limited card pool
22:56:41 <ajj2> yeah
22:57:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> i still think all of mtg is going to very gradually get put into arena
22:57:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> i just hope they stop doing stupid hearthstone crap that no one wants
22:57:29 <registered_mirc> i hope so
22:58:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> well theres been talk recently of adding all of pioneer, which would be all new sets since 2012
22:58:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> which would be cool
22:58:52 <eric> i guess it must be a pain in the ass because u got to program in all thre rules and such
22:58:58 <eric> allk the card effects
22:59:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
22:59:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> even moreso i think is the fact that theyd have to add all these new fuckin animations and stuff in
22:59:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> for specific cards
22:59:44 <this_fellow_kermit> jarf
22:59:53 <eric> jarfjarfbenjinks
23:00:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> the game is already really resource intensive which does not really portend great things for adding more huge blocks of cards
23:00:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk how you really go back and optimize better when youre already working on these bones
23:00:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> but im not a game dev so
23:00:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> not my problem
23:00:43 <eric> yeah
23:00:55 <eric> if its designed well behind the scenes it might not be too bad
23:01:09 <eric> but it depends where the bottleneck is
23:01:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> its funny how poorly it was designed after being developed for like, a really long time
23:01:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> the experience of playing in arena is generally really good though so i guess theyve been successful in terms of presentation even if the game makes peoples computers liquefy
23:05:26 <the`shima> lmao this Cumtown about Tom of finland
23:06:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> i went over my target fat again on the macro thing by having a very small smoothie and then a bunch of almonds
