02:54:40 <NORG> Gunko
02:59:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> 9:07:49 PM <Homie_in_a_geod> christ it is fuckin hard to keep to 53 grams of fat a day
02:59:42 <the_tasteful_nerd> like i said, dont worry about it too much
03:00:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> u need like a week or two of good data for it to dial you in and its possible itll bump you up
03:20:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> the_tasteful_nerd: well i can’t even really get good data in terms of what this app needs until this fucking scale shows up
03:20:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> which according to the website was supposed to be the day after i put the order in but obviously is Not that
03:21:06 <mikev> that is a serious diet damn
03:21:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah thats just another reason not to worry about it much
03:22:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> like you almost certainly do not need to be eating as litte as 1600 calories a day
03:23:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> i am trying to just go with it and not gripe too much but man the whole thing blows to me at this time
03:24:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> at such a point as i experience any actual improvement maybe i will stop hating it so much but right now it makes eating such a fucking chore
03:24:52 <mikev> you will notice in a week or two i would say
03:24:55 <mikev> pretty significantly
03:25:03 <mikev> i did something like that in the summer
03:25:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> right now this shit is more unpleasant than quitting nicotine was
03:25:16 <mikev> and dropped like 6-8 pounds over a couple months
03:27:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> somehow the couple handfuls of almonds i ate before have given me fully liquid diarrhea
03:27:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> the hits just keep on coming
03:27:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> well you cant notice improvement without the tools to do so, so just trust the process
03:28:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> and when you get weight measurements im fairly certain its gonna bump your calories up
03:28:56 <the_tasteful_nerd> thats pretty low  for a 0.5% loss per week
03:28:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> i’m doing my best i just hate the process as it clashes so severely with the ways in which eating has generally in my life been something comforting and not stressful
03:29:10 <bonegar> elden ring
03:29:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk i gave like 35% body fat as an estimate maybe i overshot and that’s why it went so low but i completely have no idea what my actual number is
03:29:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> or even how you figure that out
03:30:18 <mikev> i think they have full body scan or something but it's not cheap
03:30:21 <mikev> so i never had one done
03:30:43 <the_tasteful_nerd> there are ways to get inthe ballpark with measurements but you just need to know the general zone
03:30:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> and it doesnt matter much at all after the initial setup
03:31:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> i based it on the little body diagrams they gave but i could be wildly off
03:31:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> who knows
03:31:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have always been a strangely proportioned person
03:31:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> buy calipers
03:31:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> no thanks.
03:31:42 <the_tasteful_nerd> i expect once you have two weeks of consistent data it will be higher calorie wise
03:31:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they're like $5
03:31:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if you're actually curious about your bf%
03:32:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> i am not really
03:32:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> this shit is stressful enough without making a fuckin scientific specimen of myself
03:32:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> i have to try and set my weight reduction to 1.5% bw / week to get itnto suggest 1675 cals
03:33:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> its just estimating your total energy expenditure to be pretty low because it doesn't have a ton of info to go on
03:33:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean it absolutely is low
03:34:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> i haven’t done shit the last week except go to one show where i leaned against a wall for 45 mins
03:34:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh for fucks sake i have to go into the fucking office tomorrow too jesus christ
03:34:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> suck my dick
03:36:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> thats good. goin for a walk, gettin that tdee up
03:37:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> no it fucking isn’t
03:37:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have so much work to do and i cannot get shit done there
03:37:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> wawa sent me an email touting a new cheeseburger salad
03:37:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> all i have to do there is sort fucking mail which is a monumentally dull task that takes forever
03:37:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> i think theyre straying a bit too far out of their lane
03:38:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/pagesix/status/1502025864359419906?s=21
03:38:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> maybe i should do this
03:39:18 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dunno if you already have diarrhea
03:39:29 <the_tasteful_nerd> seems like it could exacerbate things
03:40:01 <the_tasteful_nerd> those people are such psychos i cant imagine anything more annoying than trying to eat raw steak
03:40:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> what better way to purge water weight

13:16:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the baltimore aquarium is cool
13:28:56 <the_chasteful_turd> it is
13:29:03 <the_chasteful_turd> i havent been in a long time
13:29:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> steve and i went for my birthday last year
13:30:12 <scoop_jackson> does it have striped bass? i feel like it should but the aquarium site didnt seem to have all the fish
13:30:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't remember
13:30:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think about shrimp mostly when i go
13:30:56 <scoop_jackson> lol
13:31:28 <scoop_jackson> i really like the aquarium in norwalk cuz of the tank with the sharks bluefish striped bass and other north atlantic fish
13:31:46 <scoop_jackson> (and childhood nostalgia)
13:33:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> is the striped bass your favorite fish
13:34:23 <scoop_jackson> its up there 
13:35:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what's your fish ranking
13:37:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when i visit aquariums the animals i'm most excited for are shrimp, crabs, and turtles
13:37:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> then probably jellyfish
13:37:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i like the weird exotic fish too
13:38:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the baltimore aquarium has birds and frogs which are also ftw
13:40:08 <scoop_jackson> ive got love for all sorts of fish, my dad is big into fishing so some of it is based on the prestigious fishing fish, so like striped bass, permit, snook, salmons/trouts 
13:40:42 <scoop_jackson> when i was growing up i had posters for fish identifying on my wall
13:40:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hell yeah
13:41:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the baltimore aquarium also has yabbies which are these big blue crayfish from australia
13:42:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> did/do you guys go fishing often?
13:43:42 <scoop_jackson> my dad goes a lot, i havent gonna fishing in a while, the last time was when i went camping at my friends bachelor party and the groom hurt his foot with an axe so while everyone else went camping he and i went fishing lol
13:44:21 <Rusty> lol oh no
13:44:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
13:45:13 <scoop_jackson> literally 15 minutes after the guy who came with the axe (the person that actually knows how to deal with the outdoors) the groom hurt himself lol
13:45:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> how did he manage that
13:45:51 <scoop_jackson> trying to chop wood in an unsafe manner i guess
13:46:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol
13:46:29 <scoop_jackson> butg yeah in the past 20 years or so ive only done like simply fishing like snapper fishing
13:46:43 <scoop_jackson> my dad wakes up at like 5 in the morning to coodinate the tides and all this crap
13:46:47 <scoop_jackson> too much work!!
13:47:08 <scoop_jackson> his spreadsheets to track the sandworm hatching patterns...
13:47:14 <Rusty> you true mother..... was the sea
13:47:20 <scoop_jackson> lol
13:47:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> does he really have spreadsheets
13:47:23 <scoop_jackson> yes
13:47:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> incredible
13:47:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's true gamer spirit
13:47:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'd like to go fishing but i'd feel too guilty  about it
13:48:08 <scoop_jackson> thats part of it to for me
13:49:14 <scoop_jackson> actually one of the more fucked up things that happened to me as i kid was that i went with a pal in 4th grade to go fishing off the dock, and then when we caught the fish he started poking the eyes out and mangling them
13:49:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what the fuck
13:49:26 <scoop_jackson> could never look at him the same after that

13:51:12 <Rusty> User reviews - Top review - Awesome.
13:51:12 <Rusty> The first time I watched Tokyo Breakfast, I was on the ground laughing. There's something so lovable about a family of Japanese people using the N word at each other. After that, I showed it to everyone I knew, and they all loved it. To fully get the joy out of this, you need to be able to overlook the expletives and the how wrong it really is.
13:51:33 <Rusty> 2001 was wild for many reasons
13:51:56 <scoop_jackson> lol
13:52:05 <scoop_jackson> Russia's is moving to ban Instagram, which seemed inevitable – and wants to have Meta, the parent company, declared an "extremist organization."
13:52:12 <scoop_jackson> russia isn't wrong there
13:52:27 <Rusty> yeah
13:53:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> russia banned twitter too
13:53:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> pretty cool
13:54:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> There's something so lovable about a family of Japanese people using the N word at each other.

15:41:54 <bonegar> different thing i think
15:42:10 <bonegar> they only do chicken strips, not actual chicken
15:42:12 <het> I mean, subset right? like raising canes is just chicken strips and that's it
15:42:17 <bonegar> yea
15:42:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> look at that raccoon

15:43:11 <Rusty> rich dudes wondering when they get to NG+ life

15:45:26 <Nude_Riker> lol
15:45:31 <registered_mirc> and all her white girlfriends at brunch love it
15:45:33 <bonegar> what's wrong with the shirt?
15:45:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if i saw someone wearing that irl i would scream
15:45:50 <registered_mirc> i would laugh at them
15:45:54 <bonegar> ^
15:46:03 <bonegar> i'd maybe even start asking questions
15:46:09 <registered_mirc> i definitely would not do that
15:46:17 <registered_mirc> gotta keep my distance
15:47:01 <registered_mirc> god
15:47:05 <registered_mirc> the smug look on her face lol

15:47:57 <bonegar> lol
15:48:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's that time again
15:48:03 <bonegar> people are so cool and funny
15:48:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this woman is married and i...
15:48:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> if i saw a white woman wearing that shirt in public i’d probably try to discreetly take a picture and then post it on twitter captioned What
15:48:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i want to see her husband
15:48:25 <registered_mirc> starting to think it's not all it's cracked up to be
15:48:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if i saw any woman in that shirt in public i would lose it equally
15:48:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> race is meaningless when you're wearing a shirt like that
15:48:43 <Melber> does anyone here watch project runway
15:48:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that is just insane
15:48:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yes
15:48:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> (sincere yes)
15:48:59 <Melber> do you remember the season with the haitian dude and the unbearably woke white lady
15:49:05 <bonegar> in the famous words of alansmithee_ 'race is a spook'
15:49:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that was this most recent season
15:49:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
15:49:08 <registered_mirc> a married woman wearing that in public standing next to her husband who has a big beard
15:49:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that episode fucking killed me i couldn't watch it
15:49:17 <Melber> it fucking rules
15:49:26 <the_chasteful_turd> aquarium time https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/T30VUb3n/1647013757.JPG
15:49:26 <Melber> it was some of the funniest television ive ever seen
15:49:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> more like project run away because that’s what i do when it comes on the tv 😂
15:49:34 <Melber> damn dude you got there EARLY
15:49:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i went to the project runway reddit after and spent like an  hour reading people arguing about it
15:49:42 <Nude_Riker> hell yeah the_chasteful_turd 
15:49:42 <registered_mirc> nice will
15:49:42 <bonegar> south carolina Urban Good Ol Boy

15:50:00 <Melber> that aquarium rules so hard
15:50:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> ollie’s hair ftw
15:50:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if there's striped bass post a pic for scoop_jackson
15:50:52 <Melber> seems an odd thing to have at the aquarium
15:50:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol https://twitter.com/baklavaiamp/status/1501994494048317442?s=21
15:51:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> robert pattinson is cool
15:51:05 <scoop_jackson> 100%
15:51:12 <Nude_Riker> been thinking about the caption on an ig story i saw earlier today
15:51:19 <bonegar> is there a the batman rip out there yet
15:51:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there are lots of things at the aquarium that are not exotic Melber
15:51:28 <bonegar> i decided i do not want to go to a theater actually
15:51:33 <Rusty> thinking about an IMDb review i saw once where they mentioned that their specific rental tape smelled like green beans
15:51:44 <Nude_Riker> "I'm just a young girl with dreams. I do whatever fun for me. And if that get your pp hard that's on you, NEVER my fault."
15:52:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like that robert pattinson and daniel ratcliffe had similar career trajectories but ratcliffe is boring and normal and pattinson became a weird freak
15:52:25 <bonegar> good caption
15:52:29 <Nude_Riker> (she has a patreon for videos of her poledancing)
15:52:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> .
15:52:42 <bonegar> your pp is on u
15:52:46 <Nude_Riker> thats true
15:53:08 <Nude_Riker> it fucked me up hearing pattinson's real accent recently
15:53:14 <Nude_Riker> i hate it
15:53:24 <bonegar> yea lmao
15:53:37 <bonegar> it really fucking sucks when he talks in this normal voice
15:53:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> what if instead of the batman it was the goatman
15:53:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have never heard it
15:53:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> something to think about
15:53:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the scatman
15:53:53 <bonegar> which, because he is an actor, it's impossible to know if he actually talks like that, but it fucking sucks 
15:53:54 <registered_mirc> scroteman
15:54:02 <bonegar> it sucks
15:54:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> scatman rob
15:54:05 -!- ajj [~ajj4@AB69CC85:47A60A5:FAA93AE2:IP] has joined #phiz
15:54:15 <Nude_Riker> he says he lies to people all the time so maybe its... a long con
15:54:41 <bonegar> english guy lying? 
15:55:00 <registered_mirc> lol https://i.imgur.com/PAn9UQ0.jpg
15:55:05 <bonegar> bunch like your pp, believing an english guy is always your own fault
15:55:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that shirt is epic
15:55:17 <bonegar> lmao
15:55:30 <bonegar> the black breastmilk shirt, this shirt...shirts of brunch
15:55:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> shirts of brunch lmao
15:56:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i feel like the heaven's gate shirt is probably not a brunch shirt
15:56:13 <bonegar> you wouldnt wear that to brunch?
15:56:26 <registered_mirc> thinking about how the dental hygienist kept saying "yeeeeesss"
15:56:34 <bonegar> lol
15:56:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i personally would but it's not on the same wavelength as like... the breastmilk one
15:56:37 <registered_mirc> not quite a yass, but dangerously close
15:56:58 <bonegar> given where you live it absolutely was a yasss but with the famous a to ae vowel shift of your region
15:57:00 <bonegar> which is even funnier
15:57:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo>  rofl
15:57:06 <registered_mirc> lol
15:57:11 <registered_mirc> i had not considered that
15:57:12 <registered_mirc> amazing
15:57:58 <bonegar> yea, i think many of the locals are entirely unware that they do it, many also obviously are, and some also play it up.. but just lolin'
15:58:14 <bonegar> mike didka voice yas qweening
15:58:20 <registered_mirc> lol

15:58:48 <bonegar> lmao
15:59:01 <bonegar> i'll admit it's very endearing when done 'right'
15:59:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've heard my boss yass
16:00:18 <bonegar> one i hear a lot now is the "Oh-Kay?"

16:05:27 <bonegar> and it rules
16:05:30 <bonegar> damn that movie was so good
16:05:33 <bonegar> they need more movies like that
16:05:48 <bonegar> I mean it sucked and was ass but very funny and entertaining
16:06:01 <the_chasteful_turd> 10:49:35 AM <Melber> damn dude you got there EARLY
16:06:11 <the_chasteful_turd> kid got us up at 5:45 so
16:06:34 <bonegar> waking up at 5:45 is a baller move 
16:06:42 <registered_mirc> rise n grind
16:07:42 <Rusty> finally downloaded the taco bell app so i can get quesaritos
16:08:24 <bonegar> .gis quesaritos
16:08:32 <bonegar> *sweating*
16:08:41 <het> uI always found quesaritos disappointing compared to what I was expecting
16:08:58 <bonegar> looking at that image... i would expect to be disappointed lol
16:09:17 <Rusty> they're fine
16:09:23 <Rusty> .gis black bean quesarito
16:09:48 <bonegar> yea just that image itself
16:10:15 <bonegar> i need to get more black beans actually
16:10:40 <bonegar> sadly the store that used to sell them in the big bags doesnt exist anymore
16:11:54 <het> I had dinner with my aunt and uncle and my cousin and her husband the other night and my cousin and her husband make the literally blandest food I've ever tasted in my life
16:12:15 <het> they made black beans and cilantro rice and I'm not sure they put any salt in
16:12:42 <bonegar> lol cool
16:12:46 <bonegar> no salt people are wild
16:12:54 <alansmithee_> i know it's probably not been that long since he wrestled but goldberg  is 55 and still huge af lol
16:13:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> salt is ftw
16:13:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> makes most things taste better
16:13:22 <het> also they put the cilantro in before cooking? which like I don't know if that is less effective flavor wise but I feel like typically it's mixed in after to give more a fresher flavor
16:13:32 <bonegar> lol
16:13:35 <registered_mirc> yeah
16:13:38 <bonegar> do they eat out often?
16:13:38 <registered_mirc> cilantro last
16:13:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what the
16:14:10 <het> bonegar: that's the thing, I don't think so because they both have dietary restrictions
16:14:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> time for the Big Smoothie
16:14:20 <het> my cousin's husband supposedly can't have nightshades?
16:14:35 <het> which, like, wow, sounds like hell
16:14:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> can check https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/CVrUuOrR/1647015263.JPG
16:14:35 <registered_mirc> perhaps they simply do not know what they are doing
16:14:45 <het> and my cousin has problems with lactose (which I guess isn't uncommon) and I think gluten?
16:14:52 <het> one of them has a gluten sensitivity
16:14:52 <bonegar> lol yea I was thinking it sounds like they have lots to learn on their food journey
16:14:57 <het> yeahhhhh
16:14:58 <het> I mean
16:15:08 <het> I think they just don't care about food
16:15:30 <bonegar> a lot of people hit the gluten-free no-salt phase of food and get absolutely demolished
16:15:34 <registered_mirc> thinking about not caring about food and trying to cool
16:15:43 <registered_mirc> like "yeah whatever just put this in now fine ugh"
16:15:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no nightshades would kill me
16:16:00 <het> shrimp1989dspinfo: right? it's crazy
16:16:05 <het> I don't know if that includes potatoes
16:16:29 <bonegar> i know some adult allergies are real, but...
16:16:36 <het> bonegar: lol that's exactly my feeling
16:16:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> steve couldn't really eat tomatoes and i had a lot of trouble coming up with things to cook for us
16:16:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i didn't even realize i relied so heavily on tomatoes until then
16:16:54 <het> like, Im not saying food allergies don't exist
16:17:00 <bonegar> idk, i guess i feel like i know a lot more people who use it as an excuse to be a picky eater or shut down aguments or enjoy the attention
16:17:00 <bonegar> yea
16:17:02 <bonegar> i get it
16:17:04 <het> but also I'm saying "hmmm how sure are you about this"
16:17:06 <het> bonegar: right?
16:17:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this wasn't an allergy, tomatoes just give him bad reflux
16:17:17 <bonegar> i think marketing encourages people to think they have it too
16:17:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> jesus fuckinf christ man
16:17:33 <Rusty> i get reflux if someone looks at me tbh
16:17:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i wonder what an actual tomato/nightshade allergy would feel like
16:17:38 <Rusty> if i think about hot sauce or an orange
16:17:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> so when i bought a scale from bed bath and beyond i also ordered a hairbrush for sydney and a bag of floss picks to use up the whole gift card we had
16:17:49 <het> bonegar: lol I kind of put my foot in my mouth one time because my aunt said my uncle was a supertaster and that's why he doesn't care for a lot of things and I think I may have outright said that supertasters are just picky eaters
16:17:53 <bonegar> i know my mother ate a tomato once and had an allergic reaction
16:17:57 <het> but he ate everything we prepared that night lol
16:18:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> supertaster
16:18:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> well all of the things shipped separately apparently
16:18:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> the floss picks arrived today
16:18:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> and look at the packaging
16:18:30 <bonegar> the supertaster era
16:18:34 <het> I love when picky eaters do the "it's really more of a texture thing" like we don't see through that
16:18:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/275atCy1/1647015521.JPG
16:18:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> are you fucking serious
16:19:01 <het> Homie_in_a_geod: lol
16:19:25 <bonegar> when adults who had severely muted tastes from... basically living in the 20th century had to deal with their children revolting at probably some pretty gross stuff
16:19:40 <bonegar> smoking cigarettes and eating canned meats
16:20:02 <bonegar> lol
16:20:17 <bonegar> thats how i do amazon returns
16:20:21 <bonegar> the box pic
16:26:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> damn douglas adams would have been only 70 today
16:26:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> i definitely thought he was older when he died
16:27:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> the british curse of looking like this in your 40s https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/BkytjXa0/image.png
16:29:14 <bonegar> they are not allowed lips
16:29:43 <bonegar> or hair
16:29:56 <dreddybajs> yeah i remember being quite sad when he died
16:30:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> you could have told me douglas adams was 49 in this pic and id be like 'yeah, definitely' https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/xgXHj9nC/image.png
16:30:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> when in reality he was probably about 32 in that pic
16:30:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
16:30:31 <bonegar> i feel like after reading the later books in the series he would have preferred to die a long time ago
16:30:36 <bonegar> grats that he finally got his wish i guess
16:30:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> he died in 2001
16:30:51 <bonegar> oh lol
16:30:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> which was indeed a long time ago, at this point
16:30:56 <alansmithee_> Homie_in_a_geod: lol he does look old af
16:31:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> but he was 49 when he died and he would be 70 now
16:31:16 <bonegar> when was the last hitchhiker book published but yea lol
16:31:43 <bonegar> i wonder if like... part of me definitely wonders if maybe brit guys just lie about their age and say they are 40 when they are 60 but idk
16:31:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk i had a big compilation of all the books when i was like 8
16:31:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> so they were all out by 1999 at least
16:32:02 <bonegar> ya i read them all at a pretty young age
16:32:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> i read them in 4th grade and they were my favorite shit ever
16:32:19 <HellaBrad> same, i remember being pretty sad about the news of his passing
16:32:26 <bonegar> hitchiker's guide to the galaxy also has the best Eagles song oddly
16:32:40 <bonegar> .yt eagles journey of the sorcerer
16:32:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
16:32:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> i was very disappointed in the movie
16:32:53 <NORG> https://twitter.com/espn/status/1502289632456843265?t=bE9cQlHcMSdyRQnKbzE8gQ&s=19
16:32:54 <NORG> lol
16:32:55 <NORG> good pwn
16:33:04 <dreddybajs> i didnt see the movie cause i knew it would be bad
16:33:07 <bonegar> i know the big labowsky made it famous to hate the eagles and i have no real opinion of them outside of this being a good song for the whole thing
16:33:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol norg
16:33:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
16:33:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> big talk from a guy who lost to the sabres though
16:33:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ^^^^^^^
16:33:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> you gotta win if youre gonna say some shit like that imo
16:34:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> tom, landeskog got ejected from the game last night for going off on the refs
16:34:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and actually commented on it in the postgame
16:34:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> standing up for kadri
16:34:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
16:35:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> kadri was going off too over a non-call
16:35:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> unfortunately that isnt true as there was no hockey last night
16:35:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> no hockey games were played
16:35:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and a goal that might have been offsides
16:35:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh true
16:35:30 <alansmithee_> Homie_in_a_geod: no man you gotta encourage hockey dudes to say shit like that
16:36:59 <alansmithee_> `hockey gotta quit relying on russians to provide all the personality, especially since you know black folks don't play
16:37:48 <eric> Rip douglas 
16:37:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> a few of them do
16:38:04 <eric> I liked his books as a yout
16:38:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> eichel is from boston also
16:38:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> or like, a suburb
16:38:09 <alansmithee_> people got so used to mullets standing in for personality that now when people have reasonable haircuts and no personality folks wonder why hockey isn't more popular
16:38:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> ryan reaves has more personality than the rest of the rangers combined, unfortunately he is very bad
16:38:12 <bonegar> i thought hockey guy personality was 'not getting paid' 
16:38:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> somewhere around there
16:38:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there's also the subban brothers
16:38:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> HATE reaves
16:38:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> sorry to say
16:38:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but he's a real jackass
16:38:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> he seems like a cool guy to me
16:38:43 <alansmithee_> i didn't think any of the subbans were good anymore
16:38:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> but he is very bad at hockey
16:38:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> they arent
16:38:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's hurt our players
16:38:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> all pk does is slewfoot guys now
16:38:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wehn he was with vegas
16:39:00 <bonegar> i dunno what NHL guys make, maybe a lot, but in my mind it's like 20,000 a year and they live with 10 other guys in a house owned by the 11th guy's girlfriend
16:39:02 <alansmithee_> i know pk was very good and borderline HoF quality early but he seemed to fall off a cliff
16:39:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> pk has always had a playstyle that does not lend itself to longevity
16:39:28 <alansmithee_> bonegar: maybe in the national horseshoe league
16:39:34 <bonegar> lol
16:39:41 <bonegar> is that not the same as hockey? 
16:39:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think minor league hockey is kind of like that
16:40:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> below the ahl level at least
16:40:02 <alansmithee_> nah the horseshoe guys are all bitter that cornhole is taking their limelight
16:40:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hockey players still make millions but they make less than any other professional sports players
16:40:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> the minimum nhl contract is i think 750k
16:40:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ya
16:40:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> or something like that
16:40:42 <bonegar> do they do a lot of league rotation like in baseball?
16:40:46 <alansmithee_> but either way it was cool whne pk was genuinely good and it sucked racists ran him out of montreal
16:40:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> what do you mean by league rotation
16:40:56 <alansmithee_> and then he sucked the end
16:41:04 <bonegar> like pluck guys out of the minors, play for a bit, send them back
16:41:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> he was really good in nashville for a while too
16:41:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> for elcs the max is like 950? i think?
16:41:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> now he sucks but hes in jersey so thats good
16:41:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> 950k
16:41:18 <alansmithee_> yeah that was in their deep playoff runs
16:41:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> you can get more than that with bonuses shrimp1989dspinfo 
16:41:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> but yeah the actual contract value is something like that
16:41:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ya
16:41:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> bonegar: yeah that happens in the nhl, i would say less than baseball though
16:42:01 <eric> They all see each other every day and the house is the stadium or training facility
16:42:05 <alansmithee_> there's not even any good black players left. seth jones was supposed to be one i thought but it seems i've not heard of him since the trade
16:42:11 <eric> And the girlfriend is the owner of the team 
16:42:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol well
16:42:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> seth jones was actually bad before the trade too
16:42:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my physical therapist's sister in law was a real estate agent for a bunch of lightning players
16:42:34 <alansmithee_> well yeah but he was at least young then
16:42:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> he puts up good numbers but his metrics are awful
16:42:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> and his contract is abysmal
16:42:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but shge didn't know anytihng about them so she just gossiped about all the young foreigners buying crazy expensive houses
16:42:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> there are good black players though
16:42:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> darnell nurse is good
16:43:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> lucas raymond is part black and he's good
16:43:13 <alansmithee_> that's not a real hockey player name lmao
16:43:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> and he's on your team!
16:43:29 <alansmithee_> darnell nurse gtfo with that nobody named darnell is playing hockey
16:43:30 <bonegar> baseball seems like is has minor-leaguer exploitation down to an exact science
16:43:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> all hockey player names are  fake
16:44:03 <bonegar> so im always curious how other pro leagues manage the racket
16:44:17 <eric> very well if its tennis
16:44:23 <bonegar> lol
16:44:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> pk's first name is pernell lol
16:44:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> k'andre miller is good
16:45:00 <alansmithee_> i haven't been paying much attention to the red wings tbh, i've gotten real casual with hockey watching so i don't know many of their players since they've sucked
16:45:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> quinton byfield is going to be really good
16:45:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Pernell.
16:45:28 <alansmithee_> like i started watching hockey after they were title contenders too so i never really saw the great teams
16:45:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> the wings arent actually good this year but they have 2 of the best young players in the league
16:46:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> and a lot more coming
16:46:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> moritz seider is pretty likely to win rookie of the year
16:46:21 <alansmithee_> who should i be looking out for? 
16:46:37 <Rusty> https://molleindustria.itch.io/democratic-socialism-simulator
16:46:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/VSGp33hG/image.png
16:46:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> still thinking about this
16:47:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> seider and raymond are already up with the team
16:48:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> jonatan berggren is a good prospect, zadina and veleno are good prospects who have been playing with the team for most of the season, unclear whether they will reach their potential though
16:48:41 <alansmithee_> well that sounds like a good base at least
16:50:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> it is
16:50:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> stevie y knows how to build a team
16:50:44 <alansmithee_> i'd like to get back into hockey again cause i always enjoyed the sport but i don't know much about the analytics anymore and since i'm not really on the forums much don't get to talk much hockey or read it
16:51:32 <eric> he shoots
16:51:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> 11:51 AM <eric> he shoots
16:51:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats really the main thing of analytics tbh
16:53:52 <alansmithee_> lol like i know when i was following things that was starting to be the big push, that shot generation was more important than other stuff
16:54:00 <alansmithee_> cause of the low scores and randomness
16:54:23 <alansmithee_> what was it corsi rating? 
16:54:42 <alansmithee_> but no idea how much they've advanced since then, at least with public stats
16:57:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> shot generation is still the thrust of it but that's now extrapolated in to xG or xG/60 and shot quality is factored in
16:58:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> people also do analytics based on how a players play affects their linemates etc
16:59:03 <alansmithee_> how are they able to measure shot quality? like what sort of metric do they look for? 
16:59:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think basically shot locations and their likelihood of scoring from those locations vs other players in the league
17:00:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/IneffectiveMath/status/1501935054766804998
17:00:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> this guy does really good player charts
17:00:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> on his charts you want the offence numbers to be highly positive and the defense numbers to be highly negative, ideally
17:00:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> (quite the opposite in this case)
17:00:50 <alansmithee_> lol i love that tweet. i don't know if i've ever heard of a player in any sport referred to as a grievous harm
17:00:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
17:01:38 <alansmithee_> also i'm entirely down for any stat called "shootiness"
17:04:45 <alansmithee_> also his follow ups are just comedy "lord knows he is trying his best" this dude is on fire
17:06:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive considered paying to subscribe to his website where i can actually look up his player charts
17:06:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> instead of waiting for him to post them
17:06:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/aaronhandler/status/1502096052794572806 lmao
17:07:48 <alansmithee_> lol i've never seen the first one but the balor vid is a classic
17:07:51 <alansmithee_> baylor
17:08:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> i had never seen it
17:08:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> its very good
17:10:11 <alansmithee_> i mean he wasn't wrong
17:10:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> definitely not
17:10:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> objectively right in fact
17:15:10 <Nude_Riker> lmao "The Biden administration has been briefing dozens of TikTok stars about the war in Ukraine"
17:15:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> going out to eat
17:16:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that really got me

18:06:15 <het> I need one more correction center question for this section though
18:08:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
18:09:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> het: Alexander Ovechkin recently passed Tom Poti to move into second place on the all-time leaderboard for NHL goals.
18:09:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> er sorry third place
18:12:34 <het> Homie_in_a_geod: lol it has to be one word to change
18:12:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> damn
18:12:52 <het> Alexander Hamilton recently passed Jaromir Jagr, etc.
18:12:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> right
18:12:59 <het> actually maybe I'll use that
18:14:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> hamilton would be better if hamilton were a hockey player
18:14:39 <het> ferda republic
18:14:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
18:14:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo>  isaw a guy at the devils game with a jagr mullet
18:15:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he kicked ass
18:15:11 <het> the round I really need to do more with is the highbrow/lowbrow where there's two questions with the same answer
18:15:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wish i coudl grow a jagr mullet
18:15:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that would be sick
18:16:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> het: do the questions also have to be, well, one highbrow and one lowbrow
18:16:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> people have done some LL 1ds things like that
18:16:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> or at least things where the answer is a really esoteric thing but then theres a second question where it is simpler
18:17:05 <het> Homie_in_a_geod: yeah 
18:17:21 <het> Homie_in_a_geod: yeah it's similar to the Stuff OR ELSE format but specifically one highbrow and one lowbrow
18:17:33 <het> (though those descriptors are fuzzy)
18:17:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah i was going to mention the or else quizzes
18:17:45 <het> so here's an example of one:
18:17:50 <het> In Norse mythology, which god is known as the arch-enemy of the serpent that encircles the world, Jörmungandr?
18:17:53 <het> Which character does Chris Hemsworth portray in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?
18:17:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> right

18:20:57 <het> the ninja turtles are helpful in this round
18:20:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> het: you could do something like this
18:21:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> Ei (prefix symbol), the prefix abbreviation of the binary unit prefix "exbi"
18:21:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> and the nelly song EI

18:23:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> This is the name of Kevin Connolly's character on Entourage
18:24:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> (i've never seen entourage but i know that theres a character named E and the guy who played him is a huge islanders fan, who directed and narrated the 30 for 30 about John Spano)

19:05:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> , please
19:05:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> If your package still hasn't turned up, please

19:06:29 <bonegar> is it at all possible for you to get a PO box?
19:06:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> no
19:07:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> 1. do you know how much that costs 2. it is extremely inconvenient to go to the post office 3. this was fucking fedex anyway
19:07:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> there is a sign on the fucking door that says not to leave packages there
19:08:48 <bonegar> 1. yes. 2. it sounds like your problem will never be fixed.

19:09:54 <ajj> ugh that fucking blows tom
19:09:59 <bonegar> it just sounds like it is never going to not happen, i would probably just melt down and pay 20 bucks a month
19:10:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> it doesnt happen about 95% of the time when we get packages
19:10:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ROPdDqxW/20220311_141001.jpg
19:10:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> if this happened every time we got a package i would get a security camera and a gun
19:10:45 <bonegar> oh sorry, i thought you had this problem a lot more. nm
19:10:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> it has happened a bunch of times yes
19:11:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> it was worse when both myself and my partner didnt work at home
19:11:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> can you have stuff sent to the fedex store to be held
19:11:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> but now we do, and all the delivery person has to do is ring the FUCKING DOORBELL
19:11:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> so someone doesnt immediately walk up and snatch the package that you left in front of the door where we have a sign saying not to leave it there
19:11:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> there is not a fedex store anywhere near here
19:12:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> are you sure it was stolen or was it just marked as delivered without actually being delivered

19:12:15 <ehn> Woah hello Claire! 
19:12:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont see why it would have been marked as delivered with a specific note that it was left at the side door
19:12:18 <ehn> What a gem
19:12:19 <this_fellow_kermit> good
19:12:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> without having been left there

19:13:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> is this going to be one of those things where i am venting because i am justifiably angry, people suggest ways that i should have spent money to make sure this didnt happen, and then when i say that is bullshit i get told that it sounds like i dont actually want to solve the problem

19:14:21 <ajj> Urban Shocker is another good one 
19:14:35 <bonegar> the USPS guys usually get it right for me, the FED EX guys have a key to the building which is nice, the Amazon and DHL guys... lol... UPS is sometimes-right, but for awhile was like 'we took this to a CVS across town good luck bitch'
19:15:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have packages marked as delivered all the time without actualyl being delivered which is why i was asking
19:15:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean almost no one is so fucking lazy that they wont take the packages up to the door that is obviously the front door, especially if they see the sign that says not to leave packages at the other door
19:15:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i am not trying to correct your actions or anything
19:15:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> and again, we are here, inside the house. all it takes is ringing the doorbell
19:15:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think anyone would expect a delivery driver to deliver a package correctly but they fuck up all the time and it's annoying
19:15:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive had packages marked as delivered without actually being delivered but i dont think ive ever had one that had a specific note about where it was left on it
19:15:54 <bonegar> yea i literally caught a guy writing a note once because he didn't want to ring the bell lmao
19:16:06 <Nude_Riker> lol yeah
19:16:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean theres a button for our apartment and the other one downstairs, usually they just mash the fucking buttons on the panel regardless of which apartment it's for
19:16:26 <Nude_Riker> they got their own pressures and things going on
19:16:26 <this_fellow_kermit> smh at karens who dont want their package leaving by the side door
19:16:34 <Nude_Riker> they on the clock
19:16:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> youre right matt. it's my fault for being upset
19:16:45 <Nude_Riker> it stincks for all involved
19:17:06 <Nude_Riker> i didnt say it was your fault tom, im saying they arent being malicious in intent
19:17:07 <bonegar> we've all been there, and we've all been angry about it i think 
19:17:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> wont someone think of the guy who left a package in front of the door with a sign on it saying not to leave a package there
19:17:39 <this_fellow_kermit> matt is probably right that it is a bigger issue than individual couriers being lazy. give nthat it keeps happening with presumably different people
19:17:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i am not tihnking of the driver other than the driver being a moron
19:17:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> fwiw
19:17:44 <bonegar> we're thinking a lot about the guy right now
19:18:39 <Nude_Riker> like... mail at my last apartment was constantly a problem, but its because of some concrete problems outside my or the mail carriers control
19:18:43 <Nude_Riker> so it just sucked
19:19:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> we have attempted to control the problems with our mail here in every way possible that doesnt involve us spending money that we don't have on a service that we shouldn't need
19:19:21 <bonegar> i really do not understand why this problem isn't solved... you'd think there would just be big metal boxes you could get everything out of built into every living place
19:19:34 <bonegar> doesnt even have to be metal
19:19:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> so it is extremely annoying when someone just ignores the sign
19:19:50 <Nude_Riker> what if it was partially metal bonegar 
19:19:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah it's pretty crazy that there aren't large bins outside of apartments in cities for package delivery
19:19:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> pretty fuckign simple thing to do, to read the sign
19:20:13 <this_fellow_kermit> i think the delivery people are probably more incentivized to haul ass than they are to deliver a quality service
19:20:14 <bonegar> it was my mistake to mention metal at all
19:20:59 <bonegar> depends on the carrier, but it doesn't look good if they get disputed deliveries either
19:21:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean ive seen amazon drivers throw the packages more or less from their car up to the stoop of a place which if my shit isnt marked fragile i wouldnt really mind just as long as theyre throwing it at the front door
19:21:27 <bonegar> yea the amazon guys are just...
19:21:39 <bonegar> dudes on the street i am not even sure if they get paid
19:21:59 <Nude_Riker> yeah and they get penalized for theft as well, its a real shit job
19:22:10 <bonegar> at least USPS/Fed-Ex/UPS seem to pay their drivers well enough
19:22:13 <Nude_Riker> so not caring is the only option
19:22:29 <Nude_Riker> UPS is union, fedex isnt
19:22:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> if someone threw this package at the correct door it would be fine too, but whether your employer incentivizes expediency or not, if you leave shit in front of a door that has a sign saying that you shouldnt leave shit there, wouldnt you expect that the potential consequences of this would be worse than those of your employer being upset because you didnt make your rounds fast enough

19:24:43 <the_chasteful_turd> i think most of those guys dont read any signs on any door ever
19:24:46 <Nude_Riker> i would expect the metrics my job is based on to matter more than customer specific demands
19:25:27 <ajj> i did also notice delivery guys never ring the doorbell anymore, its mad annoying
19:25:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> and do you expect that there are no consequences for the driver when someones shit they delivered gets stolen, which are worse than the former
19:25:29 <bonegar> i would melt down, cry, fantasize about violence, then start refusing all mail, pretend i do not have an address at all, then open a PO box i guess.
19:25:37 <the_chasteful_turd> i had a sign not to ring the doorbell because we had a sleeping baby when ollie was born
19:25:42 <the_chasteful_turd> and guess how that worked out

19:25:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> ajj as i mentioned before usps always rings both of the doorbells for our building rather than just the correct one

19:27:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> moreso than the driver here
19:27:32 <bonegar> yea just kinda no clue about density/access 
19:28:01 <bonegar> if i had a regular theft problem it would probably be a neighbor or maybe someone just following the delivery guy
19:28:12 <registered_mirc> yeah tom remember when art i sent you was stolen
19:28:17 <registered_mirc> that was awesome.
19:28:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> i sure do!
19:28:30 <registered_mirc> i bet it went into the trash too
19:28:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> its probably guys who just go around neighborhoods during the day looking for packages on stoops or in front of doors
19:28:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> im sure it did!
19:28:36 <registered_mirc> yeah
19:28:38 <registered_mirc> 100%
19:29:09 <Nude_Riker> yeah people will straight up follow delivery drivers around
19:29:19 <bonegar> i just got a weird text from my landlord
19:29:20 <Nude_Riker> as well
19:29:25 <bonegar> it says "There's an electrician in the basement."
19:29:27 <bonegar> that's it
19:29:28 <Nude_Riker> lol
19:29:33 <NORG> scary
19:29:40 <registered_mirc> scary stories to tell in the dark
19:29:43 <the_chasteful_turd> lol
19:29:43 <NORG> I'm going to play more DQ4 if anyone is interested 
19:29:43 <bonegar> like.. is he going to turn the electricity off? can he tell me first?
19:29:45 <registered_mirc> it's the viper. i'mon my way
19:29:48 <NORG> I just finished the 'Prologue' So to speak
19:29:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i hope you have a good time NORG
19:29:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> well the package was gone less than an hour after it was supposedly delivered so if it was in fact stolen it was probably someone who was following the delivery car or at least not far behind
19:29:54 <NORG> and now I am leveling up my hero, Jenny
19:30:27 <the_chasteful_turd> dairy queen 4
19:30:47 <NORG> sheldon ring any% down to sub-40 minutes
19:30:50 <NORG> very funny
19:30:58 <registered_mirc> yah
19:30:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
19:31:04 <registered_mirc> the run is wild now
19:31:15 <registered_mirc> dist is currently testing a really fucked up new teleport glitch
19:31:20 <registered_mirc> that barely works at all
19:32:13 <registered_mirc> if you didnt have audio on his channel looks like he's just going insane
19:32:32 <ajj> lol
19:33:43 <bonegar> speaking of things that shouldn't be problems... my neighbor smoking problem has gotten worse, and I have been lobbing these things into the stairwell like grenades https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/~tgAAOSwsjJgfM~R/s-l300.jpg they're starting to build up
19:33:55 <bonegar> it's cool to see the detrius start to fill up the stairwell
19:34:18 <the_chasteful_turd> lol
19:34:25 <bonegar> they're like only a dollar
19:34:29 <the_chasteful_turd> febreeze smoke grenade
19:34:34 <registered_mirc> lol
19:34:35 <bonegar> at first i tried to kinda convertly place them in a nice way
19:34:44 <registered_mirc> paint them green to look like actual grenades
19:34:54 <bonegar> but it hasn't really helped.. so i started putting more out.. now i just chuck one into the stairwell furiously
19:35:13 <bonegar> there's gonna be like 20 of those in there by summer
19:35:20 <registered_mirc> spray paint "get fucked smoker" across their door
19:35:33 <bonegar> i mean they're kinda already fucking themselves
19:35:42 <bonegar> if i found out who was doing it i would tearfully offer to buy them a vape pen
19:36:06 <bonegar> i would drive them to the weird vape guy store myself
19:36:23 <the_chasteful_turd> leavea copy of Vape Monthly on their doormat
19:36:26 <registered_mirc> lol
19:36:27 <bonegar> lmao
19:36:32 <registered_mirc> .g vape monthly
19:36:34 <bonegar> i absolutely would
19:36:39 <registered_mirc> there it is
19:36:42 <Melber> the_chasteful_turd: i should be home around 430 or so i think
19:36:44 <Melber> just fyi
19:36:46 <registered_mirc> buy them a Zample Box
19:36:51 <bonegar> i would if i knew
19:36:57 <the_chasteful_turd> ok cool
19:37:04 <bonegar> i just dont know who is doing it in my building
19:37:12 <registered_mirc> god everything about vaping is so gross
19:37:17 <registered_mirc> Zample Box. E-Juice
19:37:21 <Melber> this afternoon got slammed with meeting despite my best efforts to avoid them entirely
19:37:24 <bonegar> maybe the woman below me, maybe the guy on the first floor, maybe the 2 people i've never seen, maybe the weird old guy with the crew cut who screams at night
19:37:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> imo tape notes in the hallway
19:37:45 <bonegar> probably not the weird old guy tho
19:37:48 <bonegar> i've done that already
19:37:49 <registered_mirc> damn bonegar you live in a uhh colorful building
19:38:00 <Melber> "night terrors" sounds like the most likely chainsmoking candidate
19:38:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> well at least my regular mail came
19:38:11 <bonegar> i actually do not think it is him oddly enough but yea
19:38:16 <bonegar> he is Most Likely
19:38:42 <Melber> old lady is my second guess
19:38:42 <bonegar> i think it might be the woman below me.. i hear her fight with people on the phone a lot
19:38:42 <registered_mirc> make the notes threatening, like If I Catch You Smoking, You Will Die
19:38:47 <bonegar> and she seems drunk a lot
19:38:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> my only recourse if fedex dont figure this shit out themselves (not fucking likely that they do) is to file a police report and then submit a renters' insurance claim
19:38:50 <registered_mirc> ahhh
19:38:56 <bonegar> yeah
19:39:04 <registered_mirc> what is the missing item tom?
19:39:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> its a scale
19:39:09 <bonegar> honestly I was thinking 'if i find out who is smoking in here not even god will help you'
19:39:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> a bathroom scale
19:39:23 <registered_mirc> lol i like that bonegar
19:39:31 <registered_mirc> threatening but like on a grand scale
19:39:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> i had a bed bath & beyond gift certificate and used it on this scale, which i need for this diet shit i am doing
19:39:40 <bonegar> i spoke to the landlord about it a long time ago, but also.. like.. i kind of don't want anyone to get evicted over it
19:39:44 <bonegar> but i want them to stop
19:40:07 <bonegar> maybe i'll hit up the hobby lobby and just cover the hallway in no smoking signs and stickers
19:40:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> why not just become a smoker yourself
19:40:16 <registered_mirc> i guess im a pretty vindictive person cos i would want that person punished
19:40:20 <bonegar> too expensive
19:40:30 <bonegar> that's like multiple PO boxes worth of money a month
19:40:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> sounds like you don't want to solve this problem.
19:40:37 <registered_mirc> lolll
19:40:40 <ajj> lol
19:40:41 <bonegar> it does?
19:40:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> sorry that was a joke
19:40:47 <bonegar> it was?
19:40:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> it was
19:40:54 <registered_mirc> zuh?
19:40:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i got the joke

19:42:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> quizzical is a word
19:42:29 <registered_mirc> you will forgive me eternally
19:42:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> quizzicle is when quiz freezes on your gutter
19:42:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> amber is the color of your internet affect
19:42:49 <bonegar> zuh is how rural leaning midwesterners would pronounce 'za' like in pizza
19:43:17 <dreddybajs> a quizzicle is an ice cream you eat when youre confused
19:43:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> a guy started singing amber in a recent channel 5 video and he said "amber is the color of your inner dream"
19:43:31 <registered_mirc> lmao actually
19:43:35 <registered_mirc> according to urban dic
19:43:36 <registered_mirc> A nutsack that is so miniscule, that its contents do not warrant being referred to as testicles, but rather a test's smaller counterpart.
19:43:41 <registered_mirc> that's quizzicle
19:43:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
19:43:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the nutshack
19:44:06 <registered_mirc> damn
19:44:16 <registered_mirc> that would be a good name for a place that sells bulk nuts
19:44:25 <registered_mirc> there's a place here called Nuts on Clark
19:44:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> nuts about nuts
19:46:27 <bonegar> i wonder if i can get free anti-tobacco propaganda from the government actually
19:46:30 <registered_mirc> ive been running around for an hour trying to figure out which ruins i missed the treasure in
19:46:39 <registered_mirc> i know there is one for sure but i cant remember where it is

20:05:19 <registered_mirc> wow, yeah maybe.
20:05:27 <registered_mirc> really makes you think.
20:08:07 <this_fellow_kermit> hudge
20:08:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ............
20:08:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> time to make a sandwich angrily
20:08:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> im so fucking pissed off about this scale shit
20:08:41 <this_fellow_kermit> let it go like incest guilt
20:08:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont have any particular interest in incest.
20:09:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> this entire dieting process was already extremely mentally taxing on me and this is really not helping
20:09:36 <bonegar> benji is into incest now too?
20:09:46 <this_fellow_kermit> its a meme you dip
20:09:51 <bonegar> oh
20:09:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> .q search cousin
20:10:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> .qs cousin
20:10:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> .qs cousin
20:10:12 <bonegar> i thought the correct meme was "incesto" or w/e
20:10:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> .qs cousin
20:10:15 <bonegar> and it was the green giant guy
20:10:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> .qs cousin
20:10:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> .qs cousin
20:10:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> anyway,
20:10:34 <bonegar> .qs incesto
20:10:44 <bonegar> lol
20:11:17 <this_fellow_kermit> https://31.media.tumblr.com/1126bc932b3723dbc329703b82c4d19a/tumblr_inline_mynn2aWJXN1sryu4t.gif
20:12:22 <this_fellow_kermit> This .gif parodies the moment in the song "Let it Go" from the hit animated feature Frozen, in which the character Elsa sings the line, "the cold never bothered me anyway," as stated in the title. In the movie, by letting her cloak fly away into the wind, she is symbolically ridding herself of her obligations to her past life. This .gif alters the context of the scene by labeling the cloak "incest guilt", to imply 
20:12:22 <this_fellow_kermit> that she is letting go of her reluctance to engage in a romantic relationship with her sister. 
20:13:14 <dreddybajs> the WICKedly talented, adele, dazeeem
20:15:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> incesto,, INCESTO
20:15:47 <registered_mirc> fat coinpurse
20:16:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i saw one of those notes on the plateau
20:16:31 <registered_mirc> its very silly
20:17:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've had some tv show on in the background and john totoro and christopher walken have some kind of gay romance subplot
20:17:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's very strange
20:17:39 <registered_mirc> lol what show
20:17:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> severance
20:17:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i guess it's an apple tv thing lol
20:18:44 <Nude_Riker> the incest guilt gif is really funny
20:19:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> idgi
20:19:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> why is incest a meme
20:19:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the only funny incest thing is that green giant es post
20:19:25 <Nude_Riker> because people on tumblr like incest
20:19:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ..why
20:19:30 <NORG> https://twitter.com/DaftLimmy/status/1502373686954717184
20:19:33 <registered_mirc> that's sooo funny
20:19:37 <Nude_Riker> because they're sick
20:19:39 <registered_mirc> tumblr people liking incest
20:19:41 <registered_mirc> lmfao
20:19:45 <registered_mirc> hilarious.
20:20:04 <Nude_Riker> thats not whats funny
20:20:18 <Nude_Riker> its that they construct these elaborate justifications around a really shitty gif
20:20:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that guy looks like he's a movie extra about to shapeshift into a demon
20:20:25 <bonegar> not sure i understand the head
20:20:30 <bonegar> is that tony robinson or w/e
20:20:43 <bonegar> with a smile filter on
20:21:32 <Nude_Riker> i think thats just how tony tobinson smiles
20:21:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats tom brady
20:21:44 <bonegar> is it?
20:21:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
20:21:51 <bonegar> are you lying to me?
20:21:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
20:21:58 <bonegar> why?
20:22:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> bit of a laugh
20:22:12 <bonegar> fair enough then, carry on
20:23:49 <letterman> tekin piss
20:23:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> feels unfair to name your book this when youre 6'7" https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ReIvmCZU/image.png
20:24:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> creating unrealistic expectations
20:24:18 <eric> If porn titles are a barometer for anything people love incest 
20:24:26 <bonegar> i knew of a few people into his stuff
20:26:00 <bonegar> without having read anything or watched anything he's said, i assume his gimmick is convincing upwardly moble new money people to cast of the shackles of middle class ethics and embrace goblinwealth
20:26:19 <Nude_Riker> yeah he's a foundational successwin guy
20:26:39 <letterman> love them
20:27:19 <Nude_Riker> like robert kiyosaki
20:27:27 <bonegar> there is genuinely a lot of cultural programming that you'd have to shed to function in a higher wealth class
20:27:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah
20:27:49 <letterman> i bet
20:27:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my friend talks about this a lot
20:28:02 <bonegar> i think most people could probably be very rich if they were open to being worse people
20:28:14 <Nude_Riker> i dont think thats true
20:28:18 <bonegar> i kinda do
20:28:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's always pointing out the ways that new money/lower class people stand out from what he's used to (old money)
20:28:37 <Nude_Riker> if for no other reason than the very nature of wealth requires poor people, so most people cannot be rich
20:28:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wonder how many calories are in a fernet and coke
20:28:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there are a ton of behavioral tells i never would have thought of
20:29:10 <Nude_Riker> my old money friend
20:29:17 <bonegar> yeah you're right in that regard but that's sorta skipping ahead a lot
20:29:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's the one who's getting married
20:29:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> how can i get drunk at the show tonight without surpassing my diet goals
20:29:39 <letterman> dont eat
20:29:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you can become friends with anyone on the internet 
20:29:51 <bonegar> you cant
20:29:51 <letterman> just drink
20:29:52 <bonegar> if you get drunk and dont eat you'll get sick and feel worse
20:29:58 <Nude_Riker> i feel like using the internet is a new money tell
20:30:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> everyone uses the internet
20:30:29 <letterman> but you shouldnt talk about using the internet
20:30:30 <bonegar> old money was using the internet in the 1970s
20:30:31 <Nude_Riker> if you're like some ducal heir why would you be on irc
20:30:33 <letterman> its so gauche
20:30:33 <bonegar> so i dunno about that one
20:30:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's not on irc
20:30:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but either way, why does it matter
20:31:13 <bonegar> i think a ducal heir could go on irc
20:31:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> internet stuff can be hobbyist in nature
20:31:24 <registered_mirc> ducal heirs can also be nerds
20:31:25 <bonegar> .g who bought SNK
20:31:25 <Nude_Riker> it doesnt matter im having fun imaginings about "new vs old money"
20:31:31 <Nude_Riker> because that also doesnt matter
20:31:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it does to old money people apparently
20:32:02 <registered_mirc> it doesnt matter in that our opinions of old money doesnt matter
20:32:09 <Nude_Riker> right, and i dont care what matters to them beyond laughing about it, so i will make up my own funny versions
20:32:15 <bonegar> old money would try to shame new money out of using the internet and still use the internet
20:32:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> im allowed to have about 900 more calories today
20:32:22 <registered_mirc> love 2 cope
20:32:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wonder how many beers that is
20:32:26 <this_fellow_kermit> https://twitter.com/elirobledo04/status/1502133709343916033?s=21
20:32:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's 9 shots 
20:32:27 <this_fellow_kermit> lmao
20:32:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> a shot is 100 cals
20:32:36 <Nude_Riker> its nouveau riche to wear sunscreen
20:32:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> i do not particularly want to have shots
20:32:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> i guess i could have like... vodka sodas with bitters
20:33:03 <bonegar> if you quit alcohol you might not even need to calorie count at all
20:33:03 <bonegar> lol
20:33:18 <registered_mirc> i sure done
20:33:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think sunscreen is probably important regardless of class status
20:33:20 <registered_mirc> dont
20:33:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah sounds like a good idea to quit all of the things i like
20:33:23 <Nude_Riker> old money gives you genetic resistance to skin cancer
20:33:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if you tan you wrinkle faster
20:33:48 <HellaBrad> New money is getting your skin replaced when the sun wears it out
20:33:58 <Nude_Riker> yeah
20:34:03 <Nude_Riker> old money wears wrinkles with pride
20:34:03 <registered_mirc> is that like
20:34:05 <registered_mirc> blood boys
20:34:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> where are you getting the skin from
20:34:13 <bonegar> the facts are the facts
20:34:18 <Nude_Riker> poor people
20:34:22 <registered_mirc> replacing old man blood with blood fransfusions from storng young men
20:34:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> one "serving" (i assume thats a shot) of fernet is apparently 135 calories
20:34:28 <registered_mirc> gransfusions
20:34:29 <registered_mirc> god damt it
20:34:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> where are the skin harvesting farms located
20:34:42 <bonegar> ... do you think they aren't harvesting skin?
20:34:45 <Nude_Riker> knowing where the farms are located is soooo new money
20:34:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no i just want to know where they're at
20:34:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like in the world
20:34:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wonder if fountain coke has the same or similar caloric density to bottled coke
20:35:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> where's the best place to farm people
20:35:11 <Nude_Riker> asking the big questions in #phiz
20:35:19 <registered_mirc> that's what we do here
20:35:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i would like to avoid the skin farms if possible
20:35:23 <registered_mirc> 5 heads
20:35:30 <bonegar> fountain coke can have less when the syrup ratio is off to the carbonated water
20:35:35 <bonegar> which happens a lot
20:36:11 <bonegar> my highschool dairy queen job taught me about this, and honestly it was way better with half-syrup imo
20:36:19 <bonegar> customers hated it tho for obvious other reasons
20:36:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> vodka soda with bitters is probably good
20:36:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> it is good yes
20:37:24 <bonegar> the switching from beers to hard liqour as a weight loss strat seems like a pretty doomed rodeo for a lot of people
20:37:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the dirt bikes and 4 wheelers are back
20:37:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> i generally prefer to drink beers though, or fernet & coke lately
20:37:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they've gone past my house 3 more times
20:37:33 <registered_mirc> vodka soda was my club drink when i both drank and went to the club
20:37:49 <registered_mirc> or vodka redbull
20:38:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think if i had a single redbull this app would delete itself from my phone and call the cops on me
20:38:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> some guys i usd to hang out with had a thinfg where they'd just do straight shots of fernet branca which was insane to me
20:39:04 <bonegar> 1 beer. nice. big size. that's pretty much all the alcohol i'll do anymore without getting physically sick
20:39:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i got Peer Pressured into joining them and almost threw up
20:39:14 <dreddybajs> Homie_in_a_geod: yeah stick to vodka with light cal mixer or white claws or something
20:39:18 <bonegar> i used to be able to drink a lot more
20:39:25 <dreddybajs> the other issue is getting drunk tends to eating high cal drunk food
20:39:28 <dreddybajs> so watch out for that one
20:40:53 <Nude_Riker> i drank 5 trulys last night, i may drink 6 tonight
20:40:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont really have that problem most of the time
20:41:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont get the "drunchies" as some call them
20:41:51 <ehn> Beer
20:41:59 <registered_mirc> now im thinking about all the times i was barely conscious leaving smartbart to the hot dog place across the street and shoveling chili dogs in my face
20:42:02 <ehn> .tw beer_boy
20:42:05 <registered_mirc> or pizza puffs
20:42:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive had a persistent fucking headache for 3 days now
20:42:16 <bonegar> drinking w/o food for me is a one way ticket to puke city
20:42:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive certainly puked from drinking too much on an empty stomach but generally if im drinking i just do not feel hungry at all
20:42:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> usually when i am drinking though, i am drinking highish abv beers
20:43:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> which are themselves filling
20:43:29 <registered_mirc> now im thinking about when anderson visited here and we got him so turnt he puked in the cab and i had to give the cab driver $50 for clean up fees
20:43:35 <bonegar> that would absolutely kill me
20:44:45 <this_fellow_kermit> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW_Gqln8RK4
20:46:19 <this_fellow_kermit> https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6x2jjSZl8iJuXihpgr1sCA/videos
20:48:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wonder how anderson is doing
20:48:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Drake and Josh star Josh Peck has joined Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer.
20:48:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> According to Variety, the 35-year-old former child star has joined the upcoming World War II epic from the celebrated filmmaker, Christopher Nolan.
20:48:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> He will reportedly play Kenneth Bainbridge, a real-life scientist who worked alongside Oppenheimer on The Manhattan Project — America’s top-secret nuclear weapon project during World War II.
20:49:35 <registered_mirc> thinking about inventing an IPA called Hoppenheimer Nuclear Option
20:49:44 <dreddybajs> thats the sons of bitches guy
20:49:50 <dreddybajs> lol registered_mirc 
20:50:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> i realized that i set the macrofactor app to allow myself more calories on fridays and saturdays
20:50:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> in anticipation of drinking
20:50:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> so now instead of 1600 i can have 1700
20:50:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> hooray.
20:50:48 <dreddybajs> make sure u log those beers anyhow
20:50:53 <dreddybajs> easy to forget after a few
20:50:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> i will be logging them
20:51:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> i will probably be too stressed out about doing it to really want more than like 2 drinks
20:51:11 <dreddybajs> 1600 seems like a pretty intense cut btw Homie_in_a_geod but if you can take it, nice job
20:51:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> well ive been fucking miserable but i havent died
20:51:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> the app might adjust itself if i could weigh myself, which i would be able to if my package with the scale i ordered hadnt been fucking stolen
20:52:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> which according to some in the chat is really a worse thing for the driver who left it in front of the door that has a sign on it saying not to leave packages there than it is for me
20:54:29 <bonegar> we're all suffering
20:54:59 <bonegar> actually it's worse for me right now actually 
20:55:48 <bonegar> just synthesizing this pain to the benefit of no one
20:56:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> it looks like bed bath & beyond might replace the scale
20:56:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hopefully it's shipped faster this time
20:57:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> that would be great
20:57:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> also hopefully i actually get it this time
20:57:29 <this_fellow_kermit> cum
20:57:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> i would really like to stop having a headache
20:58:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> maybe i should neti pot
20:58:22 <scoop_jackson> jfc i was lazying with qcing something my coworker did a few months ago and now its fuckin g me cuz i didnt catch his mistake
20:58:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> that sucks
20:59:17 <registered_mirc> sorry dude
20:59:23 <registered_mirc> what is going to happen?
20:59:34 <scoop_jackson> just means i have to do more work
20:59:50 <scoop_jackson> not the end of the world
20:59:58 <scoop_jackson> but thats what i get for cutting corners
21:00:05 <bonegar> the end of the world would mean no more work
21:03:17 <mandarin_toni> fernet & coke ftw
21:17:44 <registered_mirc> mini pizzas incoming
21:19:05 <bonegar> .gis mini pizza
21:20:19 <registered_mirc> mine are bigger, as they are on english muffins
21:20:21 <registered_mirc> but that's the idea
21:29:49 <the_chasteful_turd> tom please just eat 2000 calories until you get your scale
21:32:23 <dreddybajs> ^
21:32:37 <dreddybajs> that would also be my advice
21:32:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think we'd all agree
21:34:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> time to do my weekly search for haunted chocolatier
21:36:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> nothing new since 1/1
21:38:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hm there's a new ice cream brand that synthesizes whey using fungi
21:39:05 <registered_mirc> interesting
21:39:08 <registered_mirc> i would try that
21:39:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i want to try it but they recommend not consuming the ice cream if you have a dairy allergy
21:39:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i haven't had dairy in 10 years so i'm not sure waht it would do to me
21:39:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://braverobot.co/
21:40:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Brave Robot does not contain any animal inputs, but does contain milk protein. It’s a paradox! The FDA requires a declaration of milk proteins because the animal-free whey protein is molecularly identical to whey protein that comes from cows. We encourage ice cream eaters who have a milk protein allergy to use the same precautions with Brave Robot that they would take with dairy. (But, reminder - Brave Robot is 
21:40:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> gloriously lactose free!)
21:41:26 <registered_mirc> i kinda doubt milk protein would do anything terrible to you but it's impossible for anyone but you to really understand that
21:42:04 <registered_mirc> there's probably some stories out there of people who haven't had dairy in a long time
21:42:41 -!- mikev [uid411717@synIRC-F47681B0.uxbridge.irccloud.com] has joined #phiz
21:42:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i've heard that it's hard for the body to digest if you haven't had it in a long time
21:42:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i'm not sure
21:42:44 <bonegar> lac. tose.
21:42:46 <mikev> lmao @ that eric adams profile
21:42:49 <mikev> You see him at an emergency food pantry in the Bronx, holding up a zucchini for the crowd. “This is how we do it,” he says, presenting the zucchini. He picks up a bell pepper. “This is how you do it,” he says, presenting the bell pepper. He picks up a cucumber. “This is life,” he says, taking the cucumber with him to the podium, placing it beside his notes.
21:43:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there's a store like 10 min from that carries it
21:43:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i'm also worried it'll be too uncanny valley and i won't like it
21:43:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't like beyond meat for that reason
21:43:57 <registered_mirc> it has always struck me as kinda weird how many products try really hard to be meat
21:44:14 <registered_mirc> i guess maybe its more to try and get people off of meat than anything else
21:44:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ah it's not fungi, it's microflora
21:44:45 <mikev> Adams tip No. 2: Do not underestimate beer as a driver of alcohol abuse. “Simply put, you can get drunk on beer!” Purchase a portable CheckMan breathalyzer.
21:44:46 <bonegar> i dont think a lot of those things are genuine
21:45:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah, those products are not primarily marketed towards vegans
21:45:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they're for the "plant based" people
21:45:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and they'd rather have products that resemble what they don't necessarily want to give up entirely
21:45:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but consume less of 
21:46:15 <bonegar> industrial plant are TERRIBLE for the evironment fam and here's why we only use recycled plants
21:46:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i do appreciate that consuming fewer animal products is now lumped in with being eco-conscious becuase it means i have more options but i don't like fake meats at all
21:46:32 <mikev> they're good if you're looking to reduce your red meat intake
21:46:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah mike
21:46:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like impossible meat though
21:46:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they make a really good spicy sausage
21:47:00 <mikev> they're both good
21:47:22 <registered_mirc> i like
21:47:23 <registered_mirc> tofurkey
21:47:34 <registered_mirc> the name is funny and its tastey
21:47:54 <bonegar> i'd probably like vegan sausage over animal sausage but only because i dislike regular sausage
21:48:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> beyond meat has more of whatever synthetic addition functions as blood and i don't like it
21:48:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you should try the impossible spicy sausage
21:48:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i
21:48:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ve had tofurkey deli slices once andi don't like them
21:48:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there are certain vegan cheese brands i like
21:48:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> violife and chao
21:49:03 <mikev> the vegan cheese is not the move for me though
21:49:07 <mikev> rubbery texture
21:49:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they've gotten better
21:49:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> violife melts really well
21:49:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and it's good cold or melted i think
21:50:18 <bonegar> yea vegan cheese feels like eating a giant glob of peanut butter or oil or something
21:51:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> daiya especially feels like that
22:06:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ?? hank hill's last name is reyes in the spanish version https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/dRZVyT70/image.png

22:27:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> remember when chief keef used to refuse to answer how old he was and would only answer 3hunna

22:41:34 <mikev> ya rip
22:41:34 <NORG> its stupid
22:41:49 <NORG> sitting in chair playing game >>>>>>>>> Lifting some crap over and over
22:41:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> falling off a ladder is an insane way to die
22:42:07 <eric> .g per capita ladder deaths
22:42:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lifting to improve my gaming tech
22:42:19 <mikev> i skipped gym today for the first time in a while
22:42:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> you want to hear an insane way to die
22:42:34 <eric> Each year, there are more than 164,000 emergency room-treated injuries and 300 deaths in the U.S. that are caused by falls from ladders. Most ladder deaths are from falls of 10 feet or less.
22:42:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> my neighbor growing up got crushed by a chimney
22:42:46 <eric> bad luck
22:42:50 <NORG> ive had two uncles die from falls its so stupid
22:42:54 <eric> unless hje was kicking the chimney or something
22:43:05 <NORG> 1 of my uncles was changing numbers on a sign. fell off ladder, quadraplegic, then dead
22:43:07 <eric> sorry to hear about your neighbour in any case
22:43:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> he was renovating his own house and had to take out the chimney that had previously been in the house, and i guess he knocked it down the wrong way or it went down in a way he wasnt expecting or something
22:43:13 <NORG> 1 of my uncles was trimming trees. fell off thing, quardapelgic. then dead
22:43:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's awful
22:43:30 <eric> be careful with heights chris, good things come in threes
22:43:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> all these stories are awful
22:43:38 <NORG> im very careful
22:43:50 <eric> jesus thats awful tom
22:43:58 <NORG> i nearly shit my pants just now (Euphemism for being very angry) but i fixed my problem and now I am calm
22:44:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what happened
22:44:07 <eric> oh good
22:44:22 <NORG> i save stated in a softlock in dq4
22:44:23 <eric> being crushed to death would be very bad
22:44:34 <NORG> but i found out how to undo save states and so i only lost like 30m of progress
22:44:35 <mikev> norg, glad you are Calm
22:44:36 <NORG> instead of 20 hours
22:44:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah i remember we were eating dinnre and interrupted by frantic pounding on door and someone we didnt know was like SOMETHING AWFUL HAS HAPPENED AT KEITHS HOUSE and i guess it was his cousin and cousins wife who had come over because they were supposed to go kayaking or something
22:44:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hell yeah NORG
22:44:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> and foudn him under the collapsed chimney or w/e
22:44:44 <eric> unless it was like a giant anvel and you didnt see it coming and it smooshed your head first
22:44:54 <NORG> that would be cool
22:44:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think my top scariest ways to die are crushed/suffocated, burned to death
22:45:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> drowning seems really fuckin bad
22:45:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> drowning is apparently peaceful towards the end
22:45:18 <eric> yeah burning and drowning im agraid of most i think
22:45:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> they say that but idk man that shit seems really bad to me
22:45:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> in fact i almost drowned and you get pretty calm when you're losing oxygen
22:45:35 <NORG> https://twitter.com/WWE/status/1502408102032949259
22:45:42 <NORG> lets go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
22:45:42 <registered_mirc> ive thought about burning a lot but i feel like you would go into shock
22:45:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
22:45:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> 5:43 PM <NORG> 1 of my uncles was trimming trees. fell off thing, quardapelgic. then dead
22:45:52 <registered_mirc> and i think once you go into shock you kinda dissociate
22:45:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> dont mean to make light of this but im looking forward to when the latter part of that happens to greg abbott
22:46:04 <eric> one time i was on a lake and someone dropped something off a boat and it was sinking slowly so i jumped in after it but it was sinking faster than i could swim down
22:46:13 <NORG> greg f-word had a tree fall on him. totally different
22:46:24 <eric> and there was just like this moment were i paused in the water and had a major freak out
22:46:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> burning seems so scary
22:46:30 <NORG> he was walking, and somehow managed to not be able to dodge a tree 
22:46:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> burning doesnt seem very good no
22:46:44 <registered_mirc> yeah eric, freaking out under water is very scary
22:47:03 <registered_mirc> its happened to me a couple times swimming, and i almost drowned when i was like 6
22:47:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you only freak out for a bit
22:47:16 <NORG> one time i did too much helium out of a balloon and did a cool seizure where i could tell what was happening but couldnt control it. i imagine thats what drowning is like
22:47:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
22:47:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> i took a kayaking class in college and i think every day of that class at least one person had a situation where they thought they were going to drown
22:47:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
22:47:32 <eric> hitting the helium too hard
22:47:40 <NORG> It was cool
22:47:43 <NORG> i just wanted to do the funny voice
22:47:49 -!- ajj [~ajj4@4EDAFF02:CD141815:FAA93AE2:IP] has joined #phiz
22:47:50 <eric> when you hear the squeak
22:48:04 <registered_mirc>  love that the helium funny voice is higher, and the nitrous funny voice is lower
22:48:07 <NORG> When yuou do the funny voice, then laugh cause its funny, and the laugh is funny too...nothing better
22:48:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> one of the things we had to do in the kayaking class was learn how to do a bow rescue, wherein youre upside down and you bang the sides of your kayak so that someone will come over at a perpendicular angle with the tip of their kayak and you can grab onto it and pull yourself up
22:48:24 <registered_mirc> chop n skrew, and nightcore, respectively
22:48:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> and when i was the person upside down for this drill, the guy who was supposed to bring his kayak over fucked up and like came in with the side of his kayak at me, so i couldnt grab onto anything
22:48:49 <eric> when i was a teen i saw my dad blow up a balloon and then inhale the air thinking it would make his voice funny 
22:49:00 <registered_mirc> lolll
22:49:00 <eric> i guess because he was a little drunk and not thinking
22:49:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
22:49:06 <registered_mirc> that's amazing
22:49:09 <mikev> tom lmao https://twitter.com/blameaspartame/status/1501827880157802500
22:49:13 <eric> but it was like one of the first moments i can remember where i was like
22:49:13 <registered_mirc> im lirling at that idea
22:49:14 <mikev> i need to hit up doni jo......
22:49:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> that tweet ftw
22:49:20 <eric> damn i guess my dad is a huge dumbass like me too
22:49:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> doni jo ftw
22:49:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ahahaha
22:49:25 <registered_mirc> lmao
22:49:39 <registered_mirc> special moment eric
22:49:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> theres some gas that makes your voice super low when you inhale it and i think is actually cheaper than helium
22:49:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> i cant remember what its called though
22:49:48 <mikev> i want some of that
22:49:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> sulfur hexafluoride
22:50:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> i learned that the reason for that (and for the helium thing in the other direction) is because sound waves move at different speeds through different gases
22:50:47 <eric> is it sulfur or sodium
22:50:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> its cool
22:50:53 <eric> idr
22:51:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> its sulfur but i think it doesnt have any smell or taste
22:51:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> which is good
22:51:42 <eric> htat stuffs more dangeours because it sits inm your lunks and ytou can asphyxiate if u put in too much
22:52:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my roommate and i are watching pam & tommy
22:52:19 <eric> i dont know if this is why it does the funny voice buut its haevier than air
22:52:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u19QfJWI1oQ
22:52:46 <mikev> i stopped watching that shrimp
22:52:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wouldn't want to do the deep voice gas because i feel like my voice is already too deep
22:52:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> ya eric its because its heavier than air which makes the soundwaves slow down
22:52:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> is it not good mike
22:52:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> your voice isnt that deep
22:52:58 <mikev> i lost interest
22:53:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> seth rogen's mullet is good
22:53:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> .y what if joker could beatbox
22:54:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think mullet is probably the best hairstyle for him
22:54:16 <mikev> the stuff about their relationship is just so uninteresting
22:54:19 <mikev> and not romantic at all
22:54:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yes
22:54:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> well we're just on ep 1
22:54:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but yeah their relationship was a nightmare

23:17:48 <HellaBrad> Rare console get
23:18:04 <the`shima> i joined some discord and it involved a "glitch" with a major retailler where they're getting stock in next week but you can only purchase it now by doing some weird thing + their customer support it would get honoured
23:18:07 <the`shima> So we will see.
23:18:20 <HellaBrad> Fingers crossed 
23:18:21 <the`shima> i had to buy horizon with it tho lol
23:18:23 <the`shima> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TadDsJRWXMk
23:19:25 <HellaBrad> The first horizon was pretty fun, havent heard too much about this one except the bosses are tough
23:19:39 <the`shima> i will probs sell it or trade it or something
23:19:51 <eric> ive heard from various experts on the subject that the ui in first rate

23:29:49 <HellaBrad> El Dorgato... the lost kitty of gold
23:30:06 <HellaBrad> Love a big orange cat
23:30:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> peter
23:31:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> 🅱️eter
23:31:12 <eric> cool cat
23:31:20 <eric> pyoter
23:31:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> tom do you call mango egg a lot
23:31:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i call peter egg/eggy/my big egg
23:32:08 <eric> i probably call agy egg more often than agy
23:32:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because he has this cream-colored bed and when he curls up in it he looks like the yolk of a fried egg
23:32:41 <HellaBrad> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/rLvFb26d/20220108_192230.jpg
23:32:47 <eric> for me it is because agy likes to sit in an egg like fashion
23:33:08 <HellaBrad> This is Mr Saturn, our lazy orange boy
23:33:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> omg his face
23:33:40 <eric> `o'
23:33:55 <HellaBrad> He makes some pretty funny faces, he has a bit of a wonky eye
23:34:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> did something happen or was he just born that way
23:34:46 <HellaBrad> He can get spooked if you sneak up on his crooked angle but he's a very sweet and cuddly guy
23:36:02 <HellaBrad> Something happened when he was really young, so he's pretty used to it by now
23:36:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> was he sick or was it an injury?
23:36:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my mom had a few cats who had herpes as kittens and they had weird eyes
23:36:35 <HellaBrad> Pretty sure it was an illness, yeah something like that
23:37:23 <HellaBrad> Something in his sinus cavity kinda bulged and pushed his eye real crooked but he doesnt have any serious health problems from it, he just snores and has his weird eye
23:38:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh no ):
23:38:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm glad he's okay
23:39:30 <HellaBrad> Thanks! Me too, I love him a lot. I also dont call him egg specifically but we do in our household refer to the giant balls of cat fur we pull from their brushes as "cat eggs" :P
23:40:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hell yeah
23:40:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> cat eggs rofl
23:40:32 <HellaBrad> Saturn sheds so much its unbelievable, the amount of fur I track into my part of the house just from brushing him and them going downstairs fills a dustpan every week
23:40:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if you look at my photo you can see peter's fur all over my hoodie
23:41:32 <HellaBrad> Haha yeah the things we put up with for these sweet guys! They're lucky they're so cute
23:42:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i love peter more than anything else on this earth
23:43:06 <HellaBrad> He looks very content!

23:52:39 <bonegar> this got me laughin
23:53:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol
23:54:00 <registered_mirc> lol
23:54:15 <registered_mirc> release the bleak scripts
23:55:39 <bonegar> they debleaked it
23:55:52 <registered_mirc> they tweaked the bleak
23:56:32 <bonegar> i mean, it probably should be bleak because the character is a loser british guy whose own arrogance fucked up countless lives but w/e
