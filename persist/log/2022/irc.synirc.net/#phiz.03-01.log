16:35:46 <registered_mirc> sick
16:35:46 <William_Hootkins> i think what happened is i replaced the db file while another was still in memory
16:35:54 <William_Hootkins> i should have shut the whole shit down first
16:36:01 <eric> yeah the db connection is probably run once

16:36:47 <alansmithee_> bonegar i wrecked magrit last night with the jellyfish summon
16:36:54 <bonegar> solo?
16:36:56 <alansmithee_> like it almost felt like cheating
16:36:57 <alansmithee_> yeah
16:36:58 <bonegar> wait you can summon in the boss fight?
16:36:59 <eric> the jelly fish ftw
16:37:00 <bonegar> how
16:37:02 <eric> yeah
16:37:05 <bonegar> whaaaaat
16:37:05 <eric> just like normal
16:37:10 <William_Hootkins> damn i need some cool summons. also the bell to summon shit
16:37:11 <William_Hootkins> lol
16:37:11 <bonegar> i did not know this
16:37:12 <registered_mirc> bind your summons to the quick menu
16:37:18 <bonegar> yea i did
16:37:21 <bonegar> but half the zones are grayed out
16:37:31 <registered_mirc> you can only summon them for a boss fight i think
16:37:32 <bonegar> maybe if you have two players you cant do it idk
16:37:41 <alansmithee_> i looked up how to summon and it said they're supposed to be for boss fights
16:37:41 <bonegar> no you can summon them on the world map
16:37:41 <eric> nah u can summon them in dungeons
16:37:46 <bonegar> i summon the wolfs all the time
16:37:55 <NORG> good news everyone the no good criterion channel has updated their programming
16:37:55 <registered_mirc> you can also summon animals if you have an NPC summon in play
16:37:56 <bonegar> some places you can some you cant, i'm not sure what the rules are
16:37:57 <alansmithee_> that was the first time i got it to work
16:38:01 <bonegar> i just assumed boss fights wouldn't let you lol
16:38:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i might try helping with margit because chris and i effortlessly killed him together
16:38:08 <eric> me neither 
16:38:14 <bonegar> thinking of the jelly fish sucking on marg is hilarious tho
16:38:17 <alansmithee_> William_Hootkins: finding the bell was a bit goofy but idk if you want to be spoiled
16:38:22 <eric> i bet i can do him now but im fighting the boss at the southern castle
16:38:22 <bonegar> i want to do the fight again just for that alone
16:38:27 <eric> the southern tip 
16:38:28 <bonegar> the bell just happens
16:38:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i tried using the jellyfish on him but it didn't do much
16:38:29 <registered_mirc> you can also level up summons
16:38:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> how do you level summons
16:38:36 <William_Hootkins> i tried to go back to that church but, it didnt trigger a cutscene or anythint
16:38:38 <bonegar> you can?
16:38:38 <bonegar> how
16:38:42 <bonegar> what the..
16:38:45 <registered_mirc> you have to do a small side quest
16:38:58 <registered_mirc> you send a girl back to the round table and then do some chatting with her and the blacksmith
16:38:59 <alansmithee_> the guide i read was that there's something else
16:39:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh i should find her
16:39:13 <alansmithee_> if you want i'll just say but idk
16:39:18 <eric> the cutscene was cool 
16:39:18 <bonegar> need this explained to me in a christian youth pastor voice 
16:39:19 <eric> the moon ftw
16:39:23 <William_Hootkins> NORG: i wish the "leaving at the end of the month" thing wasnt at the bottom
16:39:31 <William_Hootkins> that u have to scroll and load 6000 times
16:39:33 <William_Hootkins> to get to
16:39:37 <bonegar> there's a girl?
16:39:40 <bonegar> did i kill her?
16:39:41 <bonegar> idk
16:39:44 <alansmithee_> but yeah idk if the jellyfish even did that much damage, just having something to divert his attention a bit helped a ton
16:39:52 <alansmithee_> i think i only used like two flask charges if that
16:39:54 <eric> ive chatted to many girls in the world between the fog or whatever
16:39:57 <bonegar> i like the wolves a lot because they look cool
16:39:59 <eric> and they are all over me let me tell you
16:40:09 <NORG> same will
16:40:16 <bonegar> wondering if i killed the girls or not
16:40:29 <registered_mirc> "spirit ashes" if you want to google
16:40:37 <bonegar> i also like the gemstone sorceror summon who wears the beard guy mask
16:40:49 <eric> i dont have enough magic points to summon that guy
16:41:01 <eric> oh wait maybe i do maybe its the wolves i dont have neough for
16:41:02 <bonegar> yah i could google a lot of this but it's kinda more fun to figure this out through passive conversation and clues in the game
16:41:04 <registered_mirc> i have a summon that's two skeletons
16:41:07 <registered_mirc> it's bad ass
16:41:12 <alansmithee_> i've only used the jellyfish, and just the once. i got the wolves and i also got something for killing some boat guy
16:41:22 <bonegar> mr god damn two skeletons over here
16:41:28 <bonegar> so damn cool
16:41:30 <bonegar> this game is so cool
16:41:37 <registered_mirc> yeah it is lol
16:41:37 <eric> yeah its fun
16:41:50 <registered_mirc> they did a great job adapting the souls formula to open world
16:41:53 <William_Hootkins> damn all the mank is leaving the channel this month
16:41:58 <William_Hootkins> gotta watch some mank
16:42:03 <bonegar> yeah, and it's genuinely wild to hear about how different everyone's builds are
16:42:04 <registered_mirc> and you still get classic souls vibes like in stormveil castle
16:42:21 <alansmithee_> also i ran into some thing that looked like tangela only instead of being a cute pokemon it was a hellish abomination and maybe the grossest thing i've seen
16:42:27 <bonegar> yea the game definitely has points where it narrows down to more trad souls stuff
16:42:35 <bonegar> the adventurer's guide is actually really cool to look at too
16:42:38 <alansmithee_> it wasn't even a boss just some nasty looking thing in a swamp
16:42:44 <bonegar> feels like a really cool video game manual
16:42:46 <registered_mirc> ive been dying to look at that but ive been too busy playing
16:42:49 <William_Hootkins> i got owned by land octopus
16:42:55 <registered_mirc> that is so awesome they included it
16:42:56 <bonegar> it's just some big splash pictures and explinations
16:43:05 <registered_mirc> i want a hard copy of the adventurer's guide very badly
16:43:09 <bonegar> reminds me of when you could buy physical media and it would come with an insert with cool pics
16:43:23 <alansmithee_> i also picked up some claws and i may try those cause that seems cool even tho i have a feeling they'd suck for me currently
16:43:30 <registered_mirc> i bought the prima games witcher 3 book and its huge and awesome but i would really like one for elden ring
16:43:32 <bonegar> i got some of those claws they look s o cool
16:43:40 <William_Hootkins> what class are you alan
16:43:42 <bonegar> my guy looks cool as heck right now lemme take a pic
16:43:45 <alansmithee_> confessor
16:43:53 <bonegar> i wonder if class effects the drops you get
16:44:14 <registered_mirc> i still haven't found good armor that i like
16:44:20 <scoop_jackson> Who are the astrologers itc
16:44:21 <eric> lol the new pup sons video was directed by jeff dutton
16:44:26 <eric> and has mitch in it
16:44:38 <William_Hootkins> nice
16:44:38 <William_Hootkins> hahaha
16:44:39 <eric> me neither mpg
16:44:39 <alansmithee_> i actually put on just cloth robes cause the heavy ass sword weighed me down
16:44:44 <alansmithee_> think i like quicker builds 
16:44:48 <alansmithee_> gotta be able to move
16:44:50 <bonegar> gonna take a pic of my guy to show you my cool guy hold on
16:44:57 <eric> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zXiLs9zKMs
16:44:59 <William_Hootkins> yeah i was quick at first cause im bandit
16:45:10 <bonegar> bandit was my fav ds1 class
16:45:47 <eric> bandit ftw
16:46:28 <bonegar> the gray hairs come with my cool helmet, so it's like a big head dress with a cool wyvern thing on it 
16:46:28 <bonegar> https://i.imgur.com/0RZDfTd.png
16:46:35 <registered_mirc> i started as dex/int prisoner but i'm levelling str
16:46:41 <registered_mirc> big sword + spells
16:46:52 <registered_mirc> and enough dex to use a bow
16:47:03 <William_Hootkins> i've added a couple points of str just to have weapon options
16:47:05 <bonegar> i started prophet and i have the most even basic bitch stats atm, but i am absolutely ready to go online once i get one more into int
16:47:08 <William_Hootkins> i need some more arrows
16:47:11 <bonegar> i will start dumping into end,str,mind
16:47:17 <registered_mirc> crafting arrows is pretty sweet
16:47:17 <William_Hootkins> annoying that i've picked up like 50 bolts but no fuckin arrows
16:47:22 <eric> do u have the crafting kit
16:47:24 <registered_mirc> i like it a lot better than buying arrows
16:47:30 <William_Hootkins> wheres crafting's kit. lol
16:47:32 <bonegar> i feel bad about killing a lot of the animals
16:47:36 <bonegar> unless they attack me
16:47:37 <eric> youi buy it from the first shop guiy
16:47:41 <alansmithee_> you buy it from some shop guy
16:47:43 <registered_mirc> crafting kit is at the first church
16:47:45 <William_Hootkins> hm. i must have missed that
16:47:46 <bonegar> i never kill the eagles or any animal that doesn't attack me
16:47:52 <alansmithee_> yeah neither do i
16:47:56 <registered_mirc> never
16:48:03 <registered_mirc> i killed a boar that came at me
16:48:04 <alansmithee_> except dragonflies cause they'll turn on you 
16:48:07 <registered_mirc> little prick
16:48:24 <William_Hootkins> yeah the boars are asshoals
16:48:27 <registered_mirc> i did not deserve his ire and he came at me anyway
16:48:28 <alansmithee_> also is there anything special for killing one of the megabears?
16:48:48 <registered_mirc> not afaik but ive only killed one that was a cave boss
16:48:51 <alansmithee_> i got led to one, hit it once for like zero damage and just horsed away
16:48:53 <registered_mirc> they are some mother fuckers
16:48:57 <bonegar> yea i killed the cave boss one
16:49:04 <alansmithee_> oh i didn't see that one
16:49:08 <registered_mirc> summoning the wolves helped a lot
16:49:14 <bonegar> the regular bears are easy enough to kill, they used to scare me at first until i stabbed one with my spear
16:49:15 <eric> the only bear i have encountered was a weird trick on a cliff side
16:49:15 <registered_mirc> otherwise it just freaks out
16:49:16 <bonegar> and it was like oh
16:49:21 <William_Hootkins> [cake boss voice] you cant kill me, i'm the cave boss
16:49:22 <bonegar> ok i can kill bears problemlessly if i need to
16:49:34 <registered_mirc> i wonder if i can now
16:49:39 <registered_mirc> they are scary
16:49:46 <eric> try stabbing
16:50:00 <alansmithee_> actually now tha ti got a summon i gotta go handle another boss i skipped
16:50:16 <alansmithee_> my confidence with a jellyfish is overwhelming!
16:50:24 <eric> yeah !
16:50:42 <William_Hootkins> i need to get summons bell and crafting's kit it seems
16:52:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i need whatever crafting instructions give you poison antidote
16:52:51 <registered_mirc> lol https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/hidetaka-miyazaki-sees-death-as-a-feature-not-a-bug
16:52:52 <alansmithee_> is there a stat that raises your carrying weight? i would've assumed str but idk
16:53:03 <registered_mirc> new yorker elden ring piece
16:53:06 <alansmithee_> like the weight that determines if you have heavy or med or light load? 
16:53:15 <eric> sounds like sopmething i dont watnt to read
16:53:27 <registered_mirc> im not reading it either
16:53:32 <registered_mirc> just marveling that it exists
16:54:19 <eric> elden ring still 3rd most played game on steam
16:54:36 <alansmithee_> behind dota 2 and what else? csgo? 
16:54:42 <William_Hootkins> ok while im at the first merchant guy is there anything else i should buy from him
16:54:42 <eric> dota 2 is 4th
16:54:49 <alansmithee_> oh dang
16:54:49 <eric> lost ark and csgo are 1 and 2
16:55:01 <eric> ive never even heard of lost ark lol
16:55:02 <alansmithee_> i didn't know lost ark was that popular
16:55:08 <William_Hootkins> well its new and free
16:55:09 <alansmithee_> it's a ftp mmo i think
16:55:11 <William_Hootkins> so that helps
16:55:17 <alansmithee_> from amazon
16:55:20 <William_Hootkins> itll fall off
16:57:12 <eric> i remember being a kid and going down the list of ftp mmos on mmorpg.com or whatever
16:57:16 <bonegar> elden ring can run smoothly on 10 year old PCs whih rules
16:57:18 <eric> and just picking one out bc i was bored
16:57:30 <eric> yeah if you dump the settings down it runs great
16:57:39 <bonegar> i have it on high and NP from me
16:57:45 <bonegar> and i only have a 1070
16:58:10 <eric> i wass  getting decent fps but i dropped it down a bit anyway
16:58:20 <eric> still have some minor stuttering i think when stuff is streamed in
16:58:25 <bonegar> i'm not too sensitive to that stuff unless it is really bad
16:58:32 <eric> yeah its nbd
16:59:10 <ajj> lost ark was also getting pushed heavy on twitch, i saw people playing it on twitch with 150,000 viewers on stream
16:59:12 <William_Hootkins> lol well the good thing about not having the crafting kit for a long time
16:59:23 <William_Hootkins> is that i have a shitload of mats
16:59:24 <bonegar> yea but.. lol if you're playing lost ark
16:59:24 <alansmithee_> yeah a lot of big streamers are playing it
16:59:46 <bonegar> amazon owns lost ark, amazon owns twitch, i'm sure a lot of the goofy money-streamers love it
16:59:51 <ajj> ive already had my fill of korean ftp mmos
16:59:59 <bonegar> yea that style/genre is exhausted
17:00:01 <eric> yeah
17:00:07 <William_Hootkins> this is like the 3rd crucial game mechanic that i've just Assumed comes later in the game
17:00:17 <William_Hootkins> when it was available almost from the jump
17:00:19 <bonegar> i still havent found the sewing kit
17:00:32 <William_Hootkins> the sewing kit is in the tunnel that connects the beach to the island
17:00:35 <bonegar> yea, classic FROM soft design, missing absolutely CORE shit
17:00:42 <eric> dont need it
17:00:44 <bonegar> love those guys
17:00:45 <William_Hootkins> near the opening area
17:00:45 <ajj> the sewing kit / tailoring tools just change the appearnece of armor
17:00:52 <bonegar> i need this more than ANYTHING
17:00:53 <bonegar> fuck
17:01:01 <bonegar> going on an EPIC quest to get this shit
17:01:28 <bonegar> it's so sick to see kingsfield 1 and 2 stuff in elden ring though
17:01:37 <bonegar> way more transparent than the souls series too
17:02:00 <bonegar> it takes a real sicko to play those though
17:02:12 <William_Hootkins> yeah
17:02:15 <William_Hootkins> real benji hours
17:02:32 <eric> tyhose games are cool
17:02:39 <eric> they look cool imo
17:02:47 <bonegar> im very glad i played through them before release of elden ring
17:02:51 <bonegar> 2 though, i didn't complete
17:02:58 <bonegar> 1 is arguably 'playable'
17:03:02 <eric> the npc models and mobs are cool looking
17:03:03 <ajj> did you ever play lost kingdoms
17:03:26 <bonegar> ajj no
17:03:34 <bonegar> is it game cube exclusive?
17:03:36 <ajj> ya
17:03:42 <ajj> im playin it on dolphin
17:03:47 <bonegar> oh wow i had no idea there was a kings field 3 and 4 either
17:03:47 <bonegar> lol
17:03:49 <bonegar> dope
17:03:53 <ajj> oh really lol
17:03:54 <bonegar> you ever stream it?
17:03:56 <bonegar> yea
17:04:01 <ajj> kf3 and 4 are much more accessible from what ive seen
17:04:05 <bonegar> lmao
17:04:05 <ajj> i watche someone do a playthrough of kf4
17:04:15 <bonegar> i had no idea they existed
17:04:30 <bonegar> me, playing the worst dumbest ones that look so cool low poly 256fes
17:04:33 <ajj> rofl
17:04:42 <ajj> they look awesome, you can see a ton of proto dark souls stuff in 4
17:04:49 <William_Hootkins> hm i guess ill get a wolfram alpha api key too

17:23:43 <bonegar> !q #phiz
17:23:46 <bonegar> lmfao
17:23:47 <William_Hootkins> lmao
17:24:03 <Rusty> I posted this video in the 2000's but accidently left it private for until now. I gave a Sunday Service on a scout trip to Shiloh battlefield about one of my religious journeys and showed this video (stop before swearing)
17:24:14 <bonegar> lol
17:24:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i was about to copy/paste that
17:24:36 <bonegar> americans remembering 9/11, somehow invading afganistan instead of saudi arabia
17:24:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm laughing at "accidentally left it private"
17:24:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> uhuh. accidentally
17:24:48 <bonegar> 20 year war until the new war
17:24:48 <registered_mirc> lmfao
17:24:49 <registered_mirc> Dude drops this the same day that ww3 starts, then uploads a video called "Horned Owl" not only a military spy drone project but an occult symbol. Knows how to skip the algorithm in both title and audio... yeah, not questionable at all.
17:24:49 <registered_mirc> "Weaving spiders come not here" huh, kevin?
17:25:00 <Rusty> trying to think of a Snyder Cut joke for this footage but i'm too tired
17:25:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this is 100% a psyop
17:25:05 <bonegar> no question
17:25:14 <registered_mirc> not going to pretend like i know that
17:25:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i am thankful for the new 9/11 footage
17:25:23 <registered_mirc> but its fun to guess
17:25:26 <Rusty> it's like when they release new stuff from Prince's vault
17:25:28 <bonegar> i dunno if it is real or not, but 9/11 is really funny
17:25:28 <Rusty> we take what we can get
17:25:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> 9/11 alive in serbia
17:25:53 <registered_mirc> the only thing i give a shit about is stuff i know
17:25:55 <bonegar> like many people 9/11 is a safe place to go to laugh
17:25:57 <registered_mirc> such as: elden ring
17:26:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's a really sick vid
17:26:05 <Rusty> the title can be read in a way that makes it seem like his nickname is 9/11 Kevin
17:26:07 <Rusty> (get your adverbs here)
17:26:13 <bonegar> lmao
17:26:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> are there any other vids of 9/11 that are so clear
17:26:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> 9/11 kevin is a GREAT nickname
17:26:29 <bonegar> 'it's me, kevin, you know, kevin, 9/11 kevin?'
17:26:42 <Rusty> 9/11 Kevin on the track
17:26:50 <registered_mirc> we need to talk about 9/11
17:26:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao

17:28:14 <bonegar> what do you mean?
17:28:29 <Rusty> Nongshim SOON Veggie noodle soup ftw
17:28:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> making connections is cool
17:28:33 <registered_mirc> just posting occult symbols in places where people react to that sort of thing
17:28:40 <registered_mirc> whip up some fervor
17:28:45 <bonegar> oh, well, i think you can just find real actual conspiracies to joke about
17:28:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah
17:28:57 <registered_mirc> they're all a joke to me
17:28:57 <William_Hootkins> quote search isn't going to work rn
17:29:04 <registered_mirc> one is as good as another
17:29:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i tihnk all the weird occult stuff is just to distract from real actual conspiracies
17:29:10 <bonegar> yea, but the jokes that trick people into believing wrong things even more are kinda sad
17:29:15 <William_Hootkins> quote search isn't going to work rn
17:29:19 <William_Hootkins> thats something alex added
17:29:24 <registered_mirc> yeah you're right
17:29:30 <registered_mirc> but i didn't actually do anything so
17:29:34 <registered_mirc> not accountable
17:29:36 <William_Hootkins> and i am not a python or regexp expert
17:29:45 <bonegar> i cant count dont worry
17:29:46 <William_Hootkins> so that bit might take me a while
17:29:49 <registered_mirc> lol
17:30:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the occult stuff can be fun to read about but it's definitely a very useful trick
17:30:17 <Rusty> yakult symbols
17:30:22 <bonegar> occult stuff is fun
17:30:43 <bonegar> but a lot of it is england guys unironically worshiping satan
17:30:56 <registered_mirc> i love occult symbols and occult stuff
17:31:03 <William_Hootkins> !q #phiz
17:31:03 <bonegar> yea it's part of human history
17:31:13 <registered_mirc> worshipping satan is just as valid as worshipping jesus tho
17:31:42 <William_Hootkins> i worship the almighty dollar like a good American
17:32:05 <bonegar> hildegard of bingen brain
17:32:16 <Rusty> !gis metropolis moloch gif
17:32:21 <alansmithee_> registered_mirc: idk if i would agree with that
17:32:23 <bonegar> buddy if i could worship the dollar my life would be golden
17:32:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's probably not good to worship evil things
17:32:34 <bonegar> but i fell into the jesus trap and now i just hate god damn dollars
17:32:47 <alansmithee_> but i'm a fan of the occult. i've thought of getting a ton of demonology books like keys of solomon and stuff
17:33:00 <registered_mirc> the whole concept of good and evil like maybe a few thousand years old
17:33:01 <Rusty> "solomon no kagi"
17:33:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my roommate has a lot of books about hte occult
17:33:09 <alansmithee_> i used to read all sorts of that stuff when i was younger, occult and paranormal shit. crypids and ufos and cults and stuff
17:33:11 <bonegar> i read some like alister crowley stuff and i just got very mad at England guy bullshit
17:33:25 <William_Hootkins> way behind on my steps today
17:33:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah he likes all that alansmithee_
17:33:31 <William_Hootkins> curse u elden ring
17:33:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> big fan of aliens 
17:33:38 <Rusty> one time i reach a bit too much of some guy's Enochian(? or something) book where he did specific rituals and talked to angels
17:33:40 <alansmithee_> i read a story by crowley in an anthology i had and it was actually pretty good for what it was, although it was kinda depressing as hell
17:33:45 <bonegar> me, a genius, went on a hike early in the AM >:D
17:34:18 <bonegar> he's so clearly a scammer alan, especially if you just read his stuff
17:34:29 <Rusty> and way back in church days i read A DIVINE REVELATION OF HELL/HEAVEN where a lady describes how God gave her tours of each
17:34:33 <bonegar> but like any scammer, it's interesting to see what he's promising and stealing from
17:34:52 <William_Hootkins> !l
17:34:52 <bonegar> like i think meditation and yoga to do more comfortable meditation is a very real thing
17:35:07 <William_Hootkins> !l cryme
17:35:10 <bonegar> so he latches onto that, but clearly wants to build a cult of personality around himself which is just... very lame
17:35:14 <alansmithee_> bonegar: i don't doubt it,, but this was just a horror story
17:35:24 <bonegar> irl is a horror story
17:35:32 <alansmithee_> now anton levay, HE'S the real deal!
17:35:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
17:35:46 <registered_mirc> anton lavey is funny
17:35:53 <registered_mirc> !y anton la vey and his calliope
17:35:56 <registered_mirc> ^
17:36:02 <William_Hootkins> bonegar: i had a child to take to daycare
17:36:08 <alansmithee_> he's basically an occult version of an ancap
17:36:09 <William_Hootkins> and also it was cold af
17:36:13 <alansmithee_> which is funny af
17:36:26 <William_Hootkins> getting warmer now though
17:36:33 <bonegar> terrifying
17:37:13 <Nude_Riker> i have procured the rotisserie chicken
17:37:16 <Nude_Riker> its keto time
17:37:21 <Rusty> occult version of ascap
17:37:33 <bonegar> i want to be 1000x nicer to anyone who has a child, but i get furious when people expect me to capitulate because they have a child
17:37:43 <William_Hootkins> anton le gay
17:37:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ^
17:37:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't know anyone with kids
17:37:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i guess i know one now
17:37:55 <William_Hootkins> im just saying morning hike is deffo the wayto go
17:37:59 <William_Hootkins> but not an option for myself
17:38:06 <bonegar> yah
17:38:09 <William_Hootkins> i usually take like a mile walk around 7pm
17:38:09 <Nude_Riker> morning hike is nice but not when its cold as shit
17:38:12 <William_Hootkins> if im getting behind
17:38:19 <bonegar> i got ya
17:38:49 <William_Hootkins> i did not make it to 10500 steps yesterday but yesterday was also deadlift day
17:38:59 <William_Hootkins> and i just did not want to make my legs go anymore
17:39:01 <William_Hootkins> by like 8pm
17:39:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wait
17:39:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i just realized
17:39:14 <bonegar> i did cold hikes, and my opinion is officially: anythign below 32 with wind is bullshit
17:39:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> 9/11 kevin put a harry potter quote in his 9/11 video description
17:39:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
17:39:21 <William_Hootkins> yeah that sucks dick
17:39:26 <Rusty> mischief managed
17:39:38 <William_Hootkins> if u got decent gloves 32 is like the edge of whats acceptable
17:39:44 <William_Hootkins> but if there's any wind its horrible
17:39:48 <bonegar> but i can handle below 32 no prob if there is no wind and snow as insulation
17:40:00 <ajj> the windchill is the worst
17:40:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> 32 is too cold
17:40:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i can't go outside until it's like 55 degrees
17:40:21 <ajj> in nebraska its always like the temperature is 30 degrees with a windchill of -11
17:40:37 <bonegar> the wind can get crazy here
17:40:44 <bonegar> but there's more sky than land here 
17:40:47 <bonegar> so i can't get mad
17:41:10 <bonegar> i also just... like wind as an idea
17:41:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> happy march everyone
17:41:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> soon it will be warm enough to go outside
17:41:30 <registered_mirc> smarch
17:41:33 <bonegar> but definitely when you get into water freezes territory it affects the human nature with all our water in us
17:41:48 <bonegar> it's insanely nice out
17:41:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> jealous
17:42:00 <registered_mirc> its so nice out that im going to play elden ring

18:36:42 <alansmithee_> like how does a horse fucking dash sideways?
18:38:51 <bonegar> me and shrimp killed 1.75 disgusting octopuses
18:41:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i just got him again by myself
18:41:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wish he gave more htan 320 runes
18:42:18 <ajj> nice
18:42:25 <alansmithee_> also is there any reason to not just pop all the golden rune things? 
18:43:38 <ajj> sometimes when you want to save up to buy an expensive item it helps to have 1 or 2 in the pocket
18:43:44 <ajj> but generally i spend em when i can
18:44:38 <ajj> also progamer tip you can just sell them to any merchent and you'll get the same amt of runes and its way faster than popping them all
18:45:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ?? you can pop the runes
18:45:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh nvm
18:45:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm an idiot
18:45:36 <bonegar> i love how all the weapons have great versatility in this game
18:45:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> or maybe i'm not an idiot
18:45:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what do you do with the runes
18:45:47 <bonegar> never thought i'd be a spear player but here i am
18:46:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've only sold them
18:47:07 <ajj> you can 'use' them in your inventory and the same thing happens
18:47:13 <ajj> it just takes like 10 seconds longer
18:47:38 <ajj> it was way more annoying in dark souls cause if you had 15 of them you had to use them all 1 by 1
18:48:41 <dreddybajs> yeah
18:48:51 <dreddybajs> still annoying you cant sell to every vendor but it's w/e
18:49:11 <dreddybajs> alansmithee_: it's nice to keep em until you need them, like you're a few thousand souls off a level
18:49:31 <dreddybajs> if you use em all you'll tend to walk around and lose all your souls more just before you get enough
18:50:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hm i got uchigatana
18:50:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> maybe i wanna switch t othis instead of flail for now
18:51:09 <bonegar> oh sick
18:53:30 <bonegar> samurai looked like such a cool starting class
18:53:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i ran into a bunch of skeletons rip
18:53:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they didn't kill me but i got scared
18:53:53 <William_Hootkins> yeah i almost did samurai
18:54:00 <alansmithee_> gonna try a dragon now
18:54:06 <William_Hootkins> gl\
18:54:10 <alansmithee_> i'm gonna get wrecked but maybe i'll do better
18:54:30 <ajj> dragons are Freaking Fail
18:54:46 <William_Hootkins> which dragon u fightin
18:54:48 <alansmithee_> man i'm tempted to get a jellyfish in real life this thing is doing wonders for my confidence
18:54:56 <William_Hootkins> lol
18:54:57 <alansmithee_> gonna go to the one right near the starting area
18:55:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> uchigatana is sick
19:09:01 <Nude_Riker> i feel confident i could defeat most jellyfish
19:11:51 <William_Hootkins> SOON. https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/eU6e2b8h/image.png
19:14:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm at some camp in caelid where some guys are fighting giant rats and i'm passively collecting runes
19:14:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> feels like cheating
19:15:40 <William_Hootkins> youll permanently lose more runes than you could ever accrue that way
19:15:43 <William_Hootkins> so i think its ok
19:16:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this seems like a really easy way to level up
19:16:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there's a site of grace right next to this encampment
19:16:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the rats wear down the guys and i'm throwing fireballs at them to kill them and get their runes
19:16:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> then i just rest and come back
19:16:58 <William_Hootkins> did anyone else go to the secret side enterance to the castle
19:17:03 <William_Hootkins> that's just a dumb dead end
19:17:03 <William_Hootkins> lol

19:30:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> reading about fc saint pauli because of one of the ll questions today and the fact that they might get promoted
19:30:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> Several bands have also made music directly related to St. Pauli: The Norwegian punk rock band Turbonegro recorded a special version of their song "I Got Erection" with re-worked German lyrics for St. Pauli.
19:30:48 <alansmithee_> and yeah i think i went in the side entrance. i'm fucking around on the other side of the world now
19:30:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> wonder how they made that work

19:31:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what was on it
19:31:30 <lavender_toni> it served its purpose
19:31:57 <lavender_toni> beyond meat and uhh jalapeno and mayo and something
19:32:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> ok the chorus of this is still i got erection
19:32:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol

19:34:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> i guess he left the band in 2010 though

19:53:46 <scoop_jackson> are you an aquawarrior or something
19:53:51 <bonegar> it's spectral
19:54:22 <scoop_jackson> !gis spectral jellyfish
19:59:26 <Melber> i wonder if i could finagle it so i could do the MSU-1 stuff with the FFIV randomizer
20:00:24 <Melber> lol the ffiv pixel remaster music is pretty good but what is this weird victor wooten shit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4BwuYALNx8&t=4992s
20:16:40 <dreddybajs> its weird in souls and elden how there are a bunch of irish/celtic names but no irish accents (from what ive heard)
20:17:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have ordered sydney cards for new deck
20:18:59 <alansmithee_> man this sucks i'm at a boss fight but it won't let me bring my trust jellyfish
20:18:59 <dreddybajs> what u get
20:19:13 <William_Hootkins> this motherr fucking giant crow can suck my ass hole
20:19:26 <dreddybajs> yea they suck lol
20:19:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> i put one of each of the foil ukiyo-e lands in sydneys deck because i am the best partner of all time
20:19:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> dreddybajs: cards for emmara soul of the accord deck
20:20:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> most notably (in terms of price) anointed procession
20:20:16 <dreddybajs> mismatching basics idk...
20:20:20 <dreddybajs> i have a foil one of those lol
20:20:28 <dreddybajs> draft chaff that i kept thinking itd be edh playable
20:20:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/4647812#paper
20:20:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> anointed procession is like 40 bucks lol
20:21:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> this decklist is subject to change a little but this is mostly it
20:21:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> 3:20 PM <dreddybajs> mismatching basics idk...
20:21:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> theyre not mismatching theres only 2 of each basic in the deck
20:21:48 <dreddybajs> o nice
20:21:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats in her 5c slivers
20:22:13 <dreddybajs> 34 lands seems very light to me
20:22:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> rest of the lands are duals/fetches/stuff like cavern of souls and sliver hive or w/e
20:22:21 <dreddybajs> but im no edh deck builder
20:22:40 <dreddybajs> oh u got ramp spells and so forth
20:22:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
20:22:49 <dreddybajs> nissa voice of zendikar is a good one
20:22:50 <alansmithee_> 34 is fine if you have a ton of ramp and stuff
20:22:51 <dreddybajs> for that type of deck
20:22:55 <alansmithee_> some of my decks ran 32
20:23:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> theres sol ring, springleaf drum, im probably going to add paradise mantle
20:23:20 <dreddybajs> u should put uhh
20:23:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> and then abundant harvest/adventurous impulse
20:23:25 <dreddybajs> whats the saga from dominaria
20:23:27 <dreddybajs> 1G
20:23:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> song of freyalise
20:23:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
20:23:31 <dreddybajs> yea
20:23:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> its going to go in i think
20:23:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have a copy somewhere
20:23:55 <dreddybajs> thats cool cause its ramp that might randomly win the game 
20:24:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
20:24:21 <William_Hootkins> nunjus
20:24:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> im thinking about putting smothering tithe in but idk
20:24:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> probably going to swap out the myojin for parhelion ii as a top end thing
20:25:14 <dreddybajs> yea play that busted card
20:25:20 <dreddybajs> everyone else will be
20:25:24 <William_Hootkins> sluck
20:26:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk how well smothering tithe fits here although i guess it helps get to the high end threats
20:26:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> like a huge X spell or whatever
20:26:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> based on early playtesting it seems like not the best use of 4 mana unless i can do it turn 2 or 3 but idk
20:27:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> the 10/15 forest plains distro on there is also definitely wrong (should be 13/12 in favor of forests)
20:27:33 <dreddybajs> idk fast mana is broken thats my opinion
20:27:33 <dreddybajs> >:D
20:27:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> the rest of the landbase is just based on what i had. if i had another boseiju it would go in there
20:27:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah but its not really that fast imo

21:10:31 <William_Hootkins> nice to get a little runeage while i do shit around the house
21:17:28 <alansmithee_> lol i just got squished by a building
21:18:43 <dreddybajs> lol
21:18:46 <dreddybajs> that happened to me... twice
21:18:50 <dreddybajs> i never learn
21:19:50 <alansmithee_> yeah i see why the reviews for this were good, and i'm glad i stuck to it
21:19:57 <alansmithee_> been playing hours the last two days
21:20:15 <alansmithee_> probably hav en't had a feel like this in a game since morrowwind 
21:20:22 <William_Hootkins> yeah
21:20:35 <William_Hootkins> its a much diff kind of game but i get that 
21:20:48 <dreddybajs> incredible game
21:21:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah will you're welcome
21:21:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's really cool how you can just crouch and get 2-3k runes
21:21:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> then rest and come back
21:22:37 <William_Hootkins> theyve found my crouching spots a few times
21:22:40 <William_Hootkins> came back and i was dead
21:22:41 <William_Hootkins> lol
21:22:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
21:22:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah sometimes the rats push them up there
21:23:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but even then you can easily pick up your runes so it doesn't matter
21:23:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i cheesed that tower too
21:23:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you can hurl fireballs at the two archers up there from teh ground and they can't get you
21:23:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there's a big shield guy on the final level that i haven't tried attacking because he spooked me
21:27:34 <William_Hootkins> i dont have any spells
21:27:35 <William_Hootkins> ftl
21:27:44 <William_Hootkins> i kiled both of those two archers
21:27:53 <William_Hootkins> theres actually: 3 shield guys up there
21:27:59 <William_Hootkins> so thats the story of how i lost 5000 runes
21:29:22 <William_Hootkins> i only have one spell rn and it requires like 16 faith
21:30:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what's your faith level?
21:30:53 <William_Hootkins> like 8
21:30:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there's someone at the roundtable that sells spells
21:31:02 <William_Hootkins> yeah i need to go back there
21:31:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there's three big shield guys??
21:31:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i only saw one
21:31:28 <William_Hootkins> at least 2
21:31:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh no
21:31:36 <William_Hootkins> theres 2 in the corners
21:31:47 <William_Hootkins> i tricked one of them into coming down the ladder
21:31:52 <William_Hootkins> and went up and saw another one
21:31:56 <William_Hootkins> and i think 2 of them pwned me
21:32:05 <William_Hootkins> so theres at least 2 but possibly a third
21:32:24 <William_Hootkins> i dont think the guy could get back up the ladder that quick but i could be wrong

21:52:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they're fun eric
21:52:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rf5 got delayed so they could add gay marriage
21:52:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wish they just patched it in
21:52:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because i've been waiting for this game for a couple years now
21:53:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they're patching it in for the jp release later on lol
21:53:09 <eric> devs finally not too lazy
21:53:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> nah it was localizers who made a fuss
21:53:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't care about this crap i just want to play the game
21:53:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it was supposed to be out last year
21:54:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the preorder bonus is lousy too
21:54:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> usually there's a good plush but this one is just a keychain plush
21:54:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so i didn't even bother
21:54:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've preordered harvest moon and rune factory games for years for this reason
21:55:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> dreddybajs: i have a mtg rules q for you
21:55:07 <eric> wow
21:55:13 <eric> physical anything is a surprise to me
21:55:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> generally i don't agree with preordering games but but that's my exception
21:55:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah
21:57:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> here's some of them https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/kXqSCNYi/20220301_165709.jpg
21:58:16 <dreddybajs> GO FOR IT Homie_in_a_geod 
21:58:17 <dreddybajs> oops
21:58:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
21:58:26 <dreddybajs> though i am no longer a juge and not au fait with new cards
21:58:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> these are very much not new cards
21:58:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> well one of them is newish
21:58:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> anyway
21:58:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> ok the question is re: utopia sprawl
21:58:45 <dreddybajs> ya
21:59:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> the language on utopia sprawl says enchant forest and it says whenever enchanted forest is tapped for mana
21:59:13 <dreddybajs> ya
21:59:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> so if you have a yavimaya out and you enchant a plains with utopia sprawl. but then the yavimaya goes away
21:59:41 <alansmithee_> falls off
21:59:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> does 1. the enchantment fall off and 2. if no, are you still able to get the extra mana
21:59:55 <alansmithee_> no longer a legal target
21:59:59 <dreddybajs> yeah it falls off
22:00:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> ok
22:00:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> ty
22:00:11 <dreddybajs> enchant X can always only enchant X
22:00:22 <alansmithee_> that rule is also why animate dead has such an insane new rules text box
22:00:25 <dreddybajs> yea
22:00:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wasnt sure if that was only when it was being cast or it continued checking
22:00:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> animate dead's rules text ftw
22:00:36 <dreddybajs> nah it's state based actions territory
22:00:51 <dreddybajs> so it would fall off and die due to state based actions, no player gets priority to do anything in between
22:01:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> got it
22:01:39 <eric> animate dad
22:01:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> that is a scenario that could possibly happen in this deck but, generally people i play with (right now that is just sydney but also the group i played with before) frown upon LD
22:03:24 <dreddybajs> classic edh player move
22:03:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> what is
22:03:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> frowning upon ld?
22:03:42 <dreddybajs> they should play vs my friend jamie's archangel avacyn deck (r/w land destruction)
22:03:44 <dreddybajs> ya
22:03:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
22:04:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> its just like, most decks have nothing to counter LD so if someones playing LD it more or less means no one else will be playing
22:05:56 <alansmithee_> a lot of edh players do
22:06:34 <alansmithee_> i had one guy concede when i revealed armaggeddon from some effect and go into this whole rant about had he known i had it, he wouldn't have even played
22:06:48 <eric> what a loser
22:06:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
22:07:03 <eric> magic players sound like such babies half the time
22:07:27 <eric> ooh i got to solve this damn game but then someone presents me with something that defeats my solution i get pissed
22:07:40 <alansmithee_> it's much worse in edh 
22:07:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> eh i mean i guess it depends on the level of your reaction but if youre playing with a group and its generally agreed that no one wants people to play a certain thing, you probably shouldnt do that
22:07:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> or find another group i guess
22:08:03 <alansmithee_> just because a lot of people think edh =  casual and casual = don't need to try to win
22:08:04 <dreddybajs> ya
22:08:10 <dreddybajs> thats why edh, is bad
22:08:21 <dreddybajs> you have to carefully negotiate whats allowed in a game of mtg
22:08:43 <alansmithee_> i remember one of my friends had some dumb chaos deck he'd play. he literally was resolving a turn in the time it took for me and another group to finish a game
22:09:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think that people should be allowed to play whatever but i also think that if you have a dedicated group that you're playing with, it's not fun when (for example) one guy is playing a cedh deck that can consistently go off on turn 3 and everyone else is playing poverty chaff
22:09:24 <alansmithee_> i mean i can feel that
22:10:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> that being said the guy who ran the group i used to play in played super degenerate shit and then would get mad if someone else hit an infinite combo on like turn 13
22:10:23 <alansmithee_> i guess my experience was less "people building decks from limited card availability" and more "people wanting to waste 3 or 4 other people's time"
22:10:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
22:10:43 <alansmithee_> although tbh outside of a couple folks i never got much pushback and just avoided those dudes
22:10:53 <dreddybajs> ya Homie_in_a_geod but i feel like power level is diff to "this strat is just not allowed even if your deck sucks"
22:11:28 <alansmithee_> hell i've seen people bitch about board wipes which is like...lol
22:11:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean if you can lock everyone else out of playing magic then your deck probably doesnt suck very much
22:11:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk whos bitching about board wipes, that's dumb as hell
22:11:48 <dreddybajs> just lost 30,000 souls
22:11:49 <dreddybajs> D;
22:11:53 <alansmithee_> i don't mind those decks (hell i played prison decks)
22:11:57 <alansmithee_> rip dreddybajs 
22:12:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> my merieke ri berit deck was probably a somewhat unfun deck to play against but it wasnt degenerate/cEDH
22:12:20 <alansmithee_> but when i talk about wasting time it's more dudes who have some durdly combo that doesn't even win but takes an hour a turn
22:12:22 <dreddybajs> alansmithee_: yeah i remember i played a game where one guy bragged about having 3-4 board wipes in all his decks, then he told someone off for casting blasphemous act later because it's "too good"
22:12:27 -!- toke_squad_yablo [~cgiirc@synIRC-385A46B9.res.spectrum.com] has joined #phiz
22:12:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> but the guy who ran my group just folded in the middle of a game he easily could have won still when i started going off and went "it's ok this just isn't fun to me"
22:12:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> like eat shit dude lol
22:12:45 <alansmithee_> dreddybajs: lmao yeah that shit sucks
22:12:53 <dreddybajs> lol for that reason i hear "you can only concede at sorcery speed" is a home rule in a lot of groups Homie_in_a_geod 
22:12:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> this guy played some lazav shit that could go off on turn 3
22:13:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
22:13:16 <eric> losing sucks i like to win so lets play again until i win
22:13:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> i changed my merieke deck anyway to be more fun/stupid
22:14:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> it used to be just about being able to untap merieke almost infinitely to machine gun down everyone elses creatures but now its just about stealing things and playing other peoples decks
22:14:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> that was kind of my original plan with it anyway
22:14:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> i should update all my decklists, they're all pretty out of date i think
22:16:36 <dreddybajs> also i think the "concede at sorcery speed" thing is to stop people going "ok, you're gonna gain 100 lifelink? i concede before damage"
22:16:45 <dreddybajs> but again if your group is doing that stuf... just tell them to stop
22:17:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> ya
22:21:40 <alansmithee_> i just realized the kamigawa lands have the kanji name of each land on them

22:28:54 <ajj> <Homie_in_a_geod> but the guy who ran my group just folded in the middle of a game he easily could have won still when i started going off and went "it's ok this just isn't fun to me"
22:28:59 <ajj> people do this in yugioh constantly lol

23:08:48 <dreddybajs> shrimp1989dspinfo: u have to beat the academy i think first
23:08:53 <alansmithee_> did you fight the giant at the capital? 
23:08:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i explored all the areas i don't immediately die in
23:09:04 <dreddybajs> the gargoyle? i ran past him lol
23:09:06 <dreddybajs> outside
23:09:16 <dreddybajs> or the 2 archers and the 1 axe giant i beat them
23:09:17 <alansmithee_> oh i think i got there a different way lol
23:10:09 <dreddybajs> i had to beat draconic tree sentinel to get in alansmithee_ 
23:10:11 <dreddybajs> it was really hard
23:10:15 <dreddybajs> shrimp1989dspinfo: what boss are u on
23:10:21 <dreddybajs> maybe we can help u out to get to next area
23:10:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've only beaten margit
23:10:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i couldn't get past the castle so i've just been running around
23:10:36 <alansmithee_> i uhh, was teleported there lol
23:10:37 <dreddybajs> oh ya so you're on stormveil
23:10:48 <dreddybajs> you should be able for the castle!! i beleive in you
23:10:55 <alansmithee_> assuming we're talking the capital city
23:11:08 <registered_mirc> capital city is another place
23:11:15 <alansmithee_> ahh ok
23:11:16 <registered_mirc> i got teleported there too
23:11:24 <registered_mirc> and theres a big fucker taking a nap

23:11:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'll try playing again tomorrow i guess
23:11:57 <alansmithee_> yeah i fell off the edge and he followed me over lol
23:12:56 <alansmithee_> i tried the claws and didn't like them unfortunately
23:13:14 <alansmithee_> seems to really not have any benefit, the damage and stagger seems less than just using a sword
23:13:28 <dreddybajs> maybe it applies bleed
23:13:30 <registered_mirc> lmfao
23:13:30 <registered_mirc> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/619709267619872771/948271769230405722/image0.png

23:14:00 <dreddybajs> hell yes
23:14:01 <dreddybajs> lmao
23:14:16 <alansmithee_> maybe that's it
23:14:20 <registered_mirc> this person is a true gamer

23:15:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i want pizza
23:15:27 <dreddybajs> i always thought turtles pizza looked soooo good
23:15:29 <dreddybajs> in the cartoon
23:15:40 <registered_mirc> yeah ive never had pizza that gooey
23:16:03 <registered_mirc> you wanna see something fucked up tho
23:16:47 <registered_mirc> https://i.imgur.com/fsNLWPu.png
23:17:06 <registered_mirc> what kind of absolute psycho would get a pizza and replace all the sauce with BBQ
23:17:06 <alansmithee_> lol what's rong with that?
23:17:13 <alansmithee_> you do it for chicken bbq
23:17:20 <alansmithee_> chicken, bbq sauce, onion
23:17:25 <registered_mirc> what the hell
23:17:33 <registered_mirc> why even bother getting a pizza at that point
23:17:40 <registered_mirc> just get bbq chicken
23:17:51 <alansmithee_> cause you want the bread and dough
23:17:59 <alansmithee_> you want a nice slice and the cheese flavor
23:18:00 <dreddybajs> yeah its a thing here
23:18:01 <dreddybajs> i hate it
23:18:02 <alansmithee_> it's good
23:18:07 <registered_mirc> no thanks
23:18:13 <registered_mirc> what about ranch
23:18:17 <registered_mirc> a ranch sauce pizza
23:18:18 <alansmithee_> i haven't had it in awhile but yeah it's a thing
23:18:20 <registered_mirc> insane people
23:18:27 <dreddybajs> its against god
23:18:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> bbq pizza sucks ass
23:18:39 <alansmithee_> https://cottageinn.com/menu/pizza/
23:18:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you can get a bbq chicky sando if you want that
23:18:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i don't like bbq pizza at all
23:18:51 <alansmithee_> they have all of those, i used to order from them a lot
23:18:53 <registered_mirc> i mean
23:18:57 <registered_mirc> japan does weird pizza
23:19:04 <registered_mirc> that's like their thing
23:19:09 <registered_mirc> i don't agree with it mostly
23:19:11 <alansmithee_> japan has some weird ass shit
23:19:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> corn and mayo pizza
23:19:21 <alansmithee_> they also had one of the best pizzas ive had there
23:19:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i love looking at jp pizza menus
23:19:25 <registered_mirc> ive had corn on a pizza that was ok
23:19:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i love corn
23:19:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't think i'd eat it on pizza
23:19:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but corn is ftw
23:19:41 <registered_mirc> it is
23:19:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> corm
23:19:44 <alansmithee_> it was funny my friend at the time ordered it, and she was like "this is the first good thing i've heard you say about japan"
23:19:51 <alansmithee_> it was called a quattro
23:20:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> quattro bajeena pizza
23:20:28 <registered_mirc> gut i know this stuff is probably good
23:20:39 <registered_mirc> it would have to be a special outing
23:20:41 <registered_mirc> like, let'
23:20:45 <registered_mirc> s get weird pizza
23:20:54 <registered_mirc> not, let's order pizza, and then someone gets some weird shit
23:21:04 <alansmithee_> bbq chicken is pretty common i thought
23:21:22 <registered_mirc> ive never had it or heard anyone ever say, hey lets get bbq chicken pizza
23:21:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah a fun thing i like to do if i'm getting pizza (or food in general) is like
23:21:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> order something normal nad then get a psycho thing to share
23:21:42 <registered_mirc> yeah
23:21:48 <the`shima> whats up guys
23:21:48 <registered_mirc> one normal pizza and one funny pizza
23:21:54 <registered_mirc> that's the move
23:22:01 <registered_mirc> we re talking about pizza that's whats up
23:22:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ordering pizza but ALSO pizza fries
23:22:14 <registered_mirc> im ok with that
23:22:25 <alansmithee_> hell i was just talking to someone who was saying how much she liked bbq pizza
23:22:29 <registered_mirc> its probably too much starch 
23:22:35 <bonegar> i guess it kinda depends on the place when it comes to pizza
23:22:43 <registered_mirc> alan, if you want it to be common its common
23:22:47 <registered_mirc> it has not been common for me
23:22:52 <registered_mirc> and i think its weird
23:22:57 <registered_mirc> but, maybe its not
23:23:03 <alansmithee_> do you get deep dish?
23:23:07 <registered_mirc> i live in chicago
23:23:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> "too much starch"
23:23:17 <alansmithee_> i know we have a lot of places that serve "chicago deep dish" but idk how authentic it is
23:23:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i can eat fries with anytihng
23:23:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> potato is my favorite carb
23:23:28 <alansmithee_> yeah i didn't know if it wwas actually a chicago thing
23:23:33 <registered_mirc> !gis lou malnati's pizza
23:23:39 <registered_mirc> that's like the gold standard
23:23:56 <alansmithee_> see that looks way better than the stuff i get, cause that crust doesn't look super thick
23:24:20 <registered_mirc> i imagine most people fuck it up but ive only had deep dish from like 2-3 places here
23:24:32 <bonegar> !gis gino's deep dish pizza
23:24:48 <registered_mirc> lou malnati's and giodano's are the two main places
23:24:49 <bonegar> looks like corn bread in that woof
23:24:54 <alansmithee_> i gotta try that
23:25:10 <registered_mirc> you can actually get lou malnati's air shipped to you
23:25:39 <alansmithee_> how expensive is that? 
23:25:47 <registered_mirc> good question, i dunno
23:26:26 <bonegar> https://www.tastesofchicago.com/category/Lou_Malnatis_Pizza?utm_source=LM&utm_medium=Web&utm_campaign=Hero_CTA
23:26:27 <registered_mirc> damn it's kinda pricey
23:26:31 <registered_mirc> https://www.tastesofchicago.com/category/Lou_Malnatis_2_Pizzas
23:26:35 <alansmithee_> apparnetly like 70 bucks for 2
23:26:39 <registered_mirc> includes shipping
23:26:53 <bonegar> i feel like deep dish is probably maybe slightly easier to make at home than regular za, if you have the right cast iron
23:26:55 <registered_mirc> i think they dry freeze it or something
23:26:57 <alansmithee_> that's not much more than the deep dish place near me per pizza lol
23:27:13 <registered_mirc> im getting detroit style pizza tonight
23:27:23 <Nude_Riker> https://twitter.com/oldking420/status/1498801990649974786
23:27:25 <registered_mirc> sorta-deep dish
23:27:33 <alansmithee_> that italian beef sandwich looks amazing
23:27:39 <alansmithee_> and detroit style pizza is great
23:27:43 <registered_mirc> yeah i love it
23:28:00 <bonegar> i just got done puking up all my lunch about 30 mins ago. i think literally the weather set me off, it's summer outside
23:28:10 <registered_mirc> sorry to hear that
23:28:17 <Nude_Riker> bleh i guess i will try and schedule doctor visit tomorrow, the weird stuff is not stopping. my mouth tastes like pennies again today
23:28:21 <Nude_Riker> damn bonegar 
23:28:26 <bonegar> it's fine, i have that post puke glow, if you know what i'm talkin about
23:28:36 <bonegar> where you feel like you're gonna die, but like 5 voms later you feel great
23:28:39 <Nude_Riker> i think i have a very minor ongoing upper respiratory infection
23:28:52 <registered_mirc> alright pizza incoming
23:28:54 <registered_mirc> very excited
23:28:56 <Nude_Riker> possibly an infection in my mouth which would be more annoying because i would have to involve a dentist
23:29:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> good luck to everyone who feels ill
23:29:08 <William_Hootkins> tee
23:29:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> mpg post a pic of your pizza when it arrives
23:29:17 <bonegar> ah geez, a dentist
23:29:18 <registered_mirc> its cool that my brain hunger is powerful enough not to let this gross discussion affect me
23:29:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the vegan pizza place is closed indefinitely
23:29:35 <registered_mirc> shrimp1989dspinfo: will do, i got pepperoin this time tho
23:29:36 <bonegar> will you post a pic of your za?
23:29:39 <registered_mirc> not very attractice
23:29:41 <alansmithee_> registered_mirc: nice you gonna elden ring later too?
23:29:43 <registered_mirc> attractive
23:29:55 <the`shima> guess ill start jojo part 3 tonight
23:29:55 <registered_mirc> alansmithee_: im elden ringing until pizza, and then more
23:29:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my roommate and i have been owned three times now trying to get pizza from the pizza place
23:30:11 <registered_mirc> like
23:30:13 <alansmithee_> sweet i've been loving it. i'm taking a break now but i'll probably stay up all night again doing it
23:30:14 <registered_mirc> was there a pizza boss
23:30:20 <registered_mirc> and it did a combo and YOU DIED
23:30:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> sadly yes
23:30:27 <registered_mirc> rip
23:30:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they keep closing unexpectedly
23:30:34 <bonegar> part 3 is when jojos starts getting really long, but also the most famous part i think
23:30:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we've ordered from there a couple times and it' sfully staffed by teens so they get confused when we order one vegan pizza and one normal one but also veg appetizers
23:31:02 <Nude_Riker> .gis jojo part 3
23:31:10 <registered_mirc> its !gis
23:31:13 <Nude_Riker> oh right
23:31:17 <Nude_Riker> !gis jojo part 3
23:31:18 <bonegar> stardust crusaders
23:31:34 <registered_mirc> alright 40 mintues til 'za
23:32:09 <registered_mirc> ive been exploring like crazy
23:32:10 <Nude_Riker> jotaro is such a bad boy
23:32:18 <registered_mirc> i have all the maps i can get before progression
23:32:31 <Nude_Riker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_OhgBAqR6s
23:32:40 <bonegar> jotaro is cool because he calls his mom a dumb bitch and yells at her then she cries a lot
23:33:06 <Nude_Riker> yar yar days indeed
23:33:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i would never call my mom a dumb bitch
23:33:34 <Nude_Riker> well you arent of the joestar bloodline
23:33:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> true
23:33:57 <registered_mirc> i called my mom a fucking bitch when i was an edgy teen with problems
23:34:00 <registered_mirc> i regret it
23:34:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my mom and i have literally never argued
23:34:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> not once in my entire life
23:34:33 <registered_mirc> damn
23:34:39 <registered_mirc> i wish that was the case for me :(
23:34:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we're bros
23:34:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when i was little i wouldn't talk to anyone except her and my dad
23:34:59 <registered_mirc> my relationship with my parents was rough til i was like 30
23:35:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> for years
23:35:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i didn't get along well with my dad until kind of recently
23:35:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> in the last few years
23:35:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i have a great stepdad which i think might be an extremely rare parent roll
23:35:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> everyone always rolls shitty step parents
23:36:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i am indifferent towards my dad's child bride
23:36:42 <bonegar> i mostly just try to do the bare minimum which is when they threaten to call the police on me for not responding to texts i tell them to knock it off
23:37:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my mom and i send pics of our cats to each other and my stepdad sends me pictures of trucks and tractors and motorcycles
23:37:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my da dhas a walmart drug phone so he can't send me pictures
23:37:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but he calls sometimes to bitch about the news
23:37:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i haven't heard from him lately because he's back together wit hthe child bride so he has an outlet
23:37:58 <William_Hootkins> does it mean something when ur tarnished boy has a glowing thing going on
23:37:59 <bonegar> dads love to get worked up about the news
23:38:13 <bonegar> depends on the glow
23:38:21 <scoop_jackson> haha my dad is a trumper annd is real stressed about biden's state of the union
23:38:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i tell him to stop watching/listening but he won't
23:38:26 <bonegar> maybe you got some power ups or used a rune toe nail thing
23:38:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i can't really put a label on my dad
23:38:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he doesn't like trump anymore
23:39:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he would have voted for sanders but didn't have that option so he voted for trump
23:39:08 <registered_mirc> my parents both know trump is a moron and im grateful for that
23:39:30 <scoop_jackson> i dont think my dad really like trump so much as he thinks trump is unfairly treated and he would vote for trump again over a democrat in a heartbeat
23:39:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> trump is really funny and it's absolutely epic he has the media all riled up about him still when he's been out of office for this long already
23:39:47 <registered_mirc> morons and fools are pretty funny
23:39:56 <bonegar> trump was probably one of the funniest presidents, rip
23:39:56 <registered_mirc> thats why they are at court with kinds
23:39:59 <registered_mirc> kings
23:40:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's dumb as hell and having a wildcard president is funnier than having a fallout ghoul president
23:40:28 <registered_mirc> it's all bad to me
23:40:34 <bonegar> obviously he was bad but it's not like rich and powerful didn't go all out winding people up to hate him even more
23:40:44 <registered_mirc> and largely meaningless with exception of how it seems to change everyone's attitudes for some reason
23:40:52 <dreddybajs> new style for my guy

23:41:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah mpg i agree
23:41:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i did enjoy all the stupid shit trump said that made its way into my cozy bubble
23:41:36 <registered_mirc> its like theatre except it sucks and affects people for real
23:41:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah
23:41:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't like the stupid party war at all
23:41:48 <scoop_jackson> lol dreddys
23:42:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they're in an entirely different social class they don't give a shit about the people battling it out on their behalf
23:47:21 -!- robophiz [~robophiz@B8C50673.F3C7BB78.33CA7D1E.IP] has joined #phiz
23:47:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have 7 ear piercings (3 in each lobe and 1 cartilage) and my nostril piercing
23:47:33 <registered_mirc> my gauges got up to 3/4"
23:47:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i had my tragus pierced but i had to take it out for an mri and never put it back in
23:47:48 <registered_mirc> i havent worn them for like almsot 10 years tho
23:47:52 <registered_mirc> ahh rip
23:48:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> all my earrings are small
23:48:03 <registered_mirc> i like the weird ear pierce places
23:48:09 <registered_mirc> with cool names
23:48:21 <registered_mirc> tragus, antitragus
23:48:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i still have a hole so i can probably shove a needle through if i wanted
23:48:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm sensitive to metals though
23:49:06 <bonegar> so you're a druid
23:49:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
23:49:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the surgical steel rings that were in my third holes made my ears spaz out
23:49:15 <William_Hootkins> i love metals
23:49:20 <registered_mirc> same
23:49:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> one of them was irritated for like two years even though i switched them out with silver
23:49:30 <registered_mirc> death metal, black metal, funeral doom metal
23:49:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it just now calmed down over the last few months
23:49:43 <alansmithee_> i like gold
23:49:46 <alansmithee_> and platinum
23:49:48 <alansmithee_> and titanium
23:49:50 <alansmithee_> and mercury
23:49:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> metal time
23:50:02 <alansmithee_> mercury is cool as hell
23:50:04 <registered_mirc> !y sickest metal riff ever
23:50:09 <registered_mirc> no not 20
23:50:10 <alansmithee_> i wish it wasn't poisonous
23:50:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what other piercings have you had mpg
23:50:21 <alansmithee_> i would take a bath in mercury
23:50:23 <bonegar> metals are funny, but im not sure i undestand what it is they're up to as elements or when they do their alloy things 
23:50:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm going to drink mercury
23:50:41 <bonegar> can you do that
23:50:51 <registered_mirc> two on one side lip rings, eyebrow rings as a teen cos i was into korn, double piercing in each side, an upper cartillage, antitragus, rook
23:50:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i want to pour mercury into m hands and let it roll around 
23:50:55 <registered_mirc> i think that's all of them
23:50:59 <alansmithee_> you can it's gonna fuck you up tho
23:51:04 <registered_mirc> i like ferrofluids
23:51:06 <registered_mirc> those rock
23:51:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ya
23:51:08 <alansmithee_> depending the amount
23:51:26 <registered_mirc> !gis ferrofluid
23:51:36 <bonegar> why are most of the elements metals anyway. seems fake.
23:51:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my mom didn't want me to get non-ear piercings as a teen  and i'm glad she didn't
23:51:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my stepdad paid for my nose ring for my 18th birthday and she was soooo mad until she saw it and then decided it was cute
23:52:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> she doesn't like tattoos either
23:52:22 <registered_mirc> i remember when nose rings were for freaks
23:52:27 <registered_mirc> piercings were for freaks
23:52:29 <bonegar> yea my parents were very strict about that stuff
23:52:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah there are too many now
23:52:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wish i didn't have tattoos but they are all hidden so it doesn't really matter i guess
23:53:10 <registered_mirc> yeah i kinda regret starting tattoos because now i have to get more until they don't look unfinished
23:53:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i only have 3 so it's fine
23:53:31 <registered_mirc> i also dont want to spend money on it anymore really
23:53:34 <registered_mirc> i have a lot, big ones
23:53:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> two small ones and a big one
23:53:37 <bonegar> i'd probably only get a tattoo if i was in some kind of clandestine cult with people
23:53:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my friend and i got matching tattoos as a drunk idea
23:54:11 <registered_mirc> thats fun
23:54:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the adidas logo with triangle punpun's face from oyasumi punpun inside of it
23:54:16 <bonegar> so that means i'll never get a tattoo because nobody will let me into their cult
23:54:27 <registered_mirc> just start your own
23:54:35 <bonegar> i wouldnt let anyone join
23:54:40 <William_Hootkins> yeah im glad i never got tattoos
23:54:42 <registered_mirc> cult of the skeleton
23:54:42 <William_Hootkins> too costly
23:54:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we don't talk anymore and looking at it makes me SAD
23:55:01 <registered_mirc> tattoo removal is better now than it ever has been before
23:55:14 <registered_mirc> but
23:55:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't think i'd ever remove it 
23:55:19 <registered_mirc> maybe you will talk again someday
23:55:27 <bonegar> you can draw upon its sadness powers as needed
23:55:43 <scoop_jackson> mpg isnt even the first person to suggest you start a cult so you should probably do it
23:55:47 <William_Hootkins> ya u might crush an audition with that
23:55:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's getting married to a woman who didn't want us to be friends so i don't think so
23:56:02 <registered_mirc> bleh
23:56:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i would join the cult of bonegar
