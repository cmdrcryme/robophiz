05:00:41 <ajj> rofl
05:01:13 <alansmithee_> Homie_in_a_geod: i'm watching that promo you linked and so far it's...idek what to think
05:01:23 <alansmithee_> the crowd's like cheering antisemitism lol
05:05:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think that was the moment that most people stopped treating it like a heel promo
05:05:52 <alansmithee_> man now i feel bad he lost lol
05:06:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> well then on the next show cm punk invited him to the ring to basically make amends and shake hands and mjf beat the shit out of him and cut his skull open and called everyone a mark for buying the promo
05:06:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
05:06:51 <alansmithee_> lmao ok fair enough
05:06:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> hes so good
05:07:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> another fun/funny mjf thing
05:07:03 <alansmithee_> i'm so fucking owned lmao
05:07:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> for like weeks it was played up that aew were having their first show on long island and mjf basically trumpeted that everyone sucked everywhere except for long island
05:07:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> and then the long island crowd gave him a hero's ovation and booed the shit out of punk
05:08:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> it was extremely funny
05:08:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> huge heel heat everywhere except for long island
05:08:40 <alansmithee_> which honestly is a heel move in itself
05:09:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> long island is a heel place
05:09:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> there are actually a shit ton of wrestlers from long island
05:09:35 <alansmithee_> well yeah everyone's fighting to get out
05:09:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
05:11:29 <ajj> rofl
05:11:30 <NORG> im rly sleepy
05:11:34 <NORG> gbut still amped up
05:12:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> good ass ppv
05:12:24 <NORG> i think that was the best 1 theyve done front to back
05:12:46 <NORG> but the 1 w/ the debuts & bucks cage match had higher highs
05:12:55 <ajj> it was rly consistently good yeah
05:12:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> ya
05:13:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> i cant believe the ahfo match was that fun lol
05:13:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> i did not expect that to be the way they ran that match
05:13:28 <NORG> other than the girls matches every single match was like high tier lol
05:13:33 <NORG> and even the jade match was okay
05:13:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> thunder and britt was good except for the finish shit
05:13:51 <NORG> i will admit i took a very long pee pee during the britt baker match but it didnt look good what i saw
05:14:07 <alansmithee_> i thought it looked a bit sloppy 
05:14:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
05:14:18 <NORG> eddie jericho was match of the night for me
05:14:19 <alansmithee_> even compared to like wwe womens matches i remember
05:14:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> eddie jericho kicked ass
05:14:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> mox and danielson also kicked ass
05:15:08 <alansmithee_> i still don't like moxley but danielson was great
05:15:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> mjf punk was as brutal as i hoped it would be
05:15:12 <ajj> i liked the preshow house of black death vs triangle match a lot lol
05:15:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> ya
05:15:24 <ajj> i love both of the spooky aew factions
05:15:29 <alansmithee_> i liked the tag match 
05:15:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> alex aberahantes is so fuckin funny in this gimmick
05:15:55 <ajj> its incredible
05:15:56 <ajj> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FNHNu_CXsAEGFGd?format=jpg&name=large
05:15:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> alex standing on the ramp and trying to look scary while going PENTA   OSCURO along with the music
05:19:40 <NORG> Lol ya he looks so stupid
05:19:46 <alansmithee_> title match i liked a lot, i liked the danielson parts of that match but thought the ending was kinda lame and seemed just to introduce regal and continue the feud, the tag  title match was cool, punk's match was cool although tbh i think that much blood is kinda gratuitous, the weird tornado tag match was way better than i thought it would be
05:20:05 <alansmithee_> the eddie jericho match was also really good
05:20:14 <NORG> only thing that didnt meet or exceed my expectations was the ladder match
05:20:20 <NORG> which was just too much corny shit
05:20:21 <alansmithee_> ladder match had some fun spots imo
05:20:25 <NORG> and not enough extremely dangerous violence
05:20:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> the ladder match was good to me for a ladder match that didnt really have high flyers in it
05:21:20 <NORG> ya it was good
05:21:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> obviously none of hobbs/wardlow/lee was going to be doing a moonsault off the top of a ladder
05:21:35 <NORG> ya i was hoping for more powerbombs through ladder bridges or some big splashes
05:22:13 <dreddybajs> sting taking that huge dive ftw
05:22:17 <dreddybajs> what a legend
05:22:36 <alansmithee_> i heard lee can do a moonsault lol

05:24:21 <dreddybajs> good angle
05:24:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> he looks a little bigger right now than he did in wwe

12:56:58 <the_tasteful_nerd> hullo
13:23:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> listening to phil spend 20 minutes talking about his back pain
13:32:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> a slob who plays video games all day has back pain? wow
13:32:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he spent literal years saying he couldn't drive or walk or do anytihng because of a Debilitating Back Injury
13:32:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> (minor car accident)
13:33:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but he pretended he wasn't able to do anything at all

13:34:30 <Nude_Riker> lmao back pain arc
13:34:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he claims he used to be a bodybuilder
13:34:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> a bodybuilder physique
13:35:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> incorrect
13:35:42 <the_tasteful_nerd> not a chance in hell
13:36:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah everyone knows this isn't true
13:36:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because there are photos of him and he was just round
13:37:46 <the_tasteful_nerd> so he doesnt know what body building is even lol
13:38:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he knows maybe 15% of the words that he uses
13:39:35 <NORG> Phil was a body builder from carrying groceries into the house until an unknown gang of assassins ran his car off the road 
13:39:39 <Nude_Riker> the good weather app someone recd to replace dark sky has too much ad shit unless you pay $25 a YEAR, ugh
13:40:35 <Nude_Riker> RIP dark sky, fuck to apple
13:41:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol NORG
13:41:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it'
13:41:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> s cool that he still references his One Day Off From Streaming as the day he exercises
13:41:50 <Nude_Riker> lol
13:42:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i use weawow
13:42:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because the stock weather app updated and now plague count numbers were before the weather for soem reason
13:42:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i don't give a shti about that, it's not hte weather
13:42:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> why should i care. show me the temperature
13:42:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> i use darksky
13:42:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there was no option to turn it off
13:43:16 <Nude_Riker> i usually just look at wunderground on desktop and the google weather app if im out but its so shit compared to dark sky...
13:43:20 <Nude_Riker> ill try weawow
13:43:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> also i have an android phone and not iphone so maybe you cannot use weawow
13:43:26 <the_tasteful_nerd> wa wa weawow
13:43:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ^
13:43:37 <Nude_Riker> yeah im on android, apple still has dark sky cause they bought it
13:43:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> if he had an iphone he could use darksky....

13:44:11 <the_tasteful_nerd> it is kinda annoying they bought darksky and havent really done anythig with it
13:44:14 <Nude_Riker> thats a long screenshot
13:44:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it gives u lots of weather info
13:44:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and you can arrange how it's displayed
13:44:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> i assumed they were gonna tightly integrate it into ios but so far that hasnt happened
13:44:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like it
13:44:37 <Nude_Riker> the_tasteful_nerd, didnt they like use the backend for their default weather
13:44:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dont know if they do or not
13:44:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> darkskyphil
13:45:00 <Nude_Riker> originally the app itself was gonna be discontinued on ios too
13:45:02 <Nude_Riker> iirc
13:45:09 <Nude_Riker> because that was the plan
13:45:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> well its taking a lot longer than expected prrobably
13:46:11 <Nude_Riker> its psych appointment day, get to say yeah the extra 5mg is good and talk about the weather
13:46:52 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah it looks like default app still uses the weather channel as its source
13:47:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> weawow uses nws
13:47:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but you can choose other options
13:48:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> actually one of them is darksky if you want ot continue receiving your weather info from them
13:48:35 <Nude_Riker> ftw

15:42:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Optical illusions (i.e., items intended to create optical illusions or interfere with the ability of the eye to perceive depth or distance, such as pinwheels and umbrellas).
15:42:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this is a funny prohibited item
15:42:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ubs arena isn't a bag-free arena which is surprising
15:43:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol no pinwheels allowed
15:44:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i guess prudential center also allows bags
15:44:37 <Nude_Riker> its weird at stores right now with the official mask mandate gone
15:44:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i
15:44:47 <the`shima> hi
15:44:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm glad i don't need to plan my jacket around its pockets
15:45:10 <Nude_Riker> im still wearing mine in stores idk
15:45:14 <Nude_Riker> hi dan
15:45:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because all my jackets that i'd wear in the arena have limited pocket space
15:45:23 <Nude_Riker> how far are you in initial d
15:45:45 <Nude_Riker> my mask (kn95) takes almost no pocket room, if i can fit my wallet i can fit my mask
15:46:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> well you have a kn95 most people do not
15:46:09 <the`shima> i havent started stage 2 yet as ive been watching joho
15:46:11 <the`shima> jojo
15:46:17 <the_tasteful_nerd> so them wearing a mask or not is largely immaterial
15:46:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i gotta bring portable batteries for our phones
15:46:22 <the`shima> very funny that ryosukes voice actor is one of the big villains in jojo
15:46:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> also masks aren't required at the arena
15:46:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> joho
15:46:59 <Nude_Riker> ive been watching the funimation dub this rewatch of initial d
15:47:25 <Nude_Riker> where are you in jojo whats happening
15:48:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> .gis weedluigi
15:49:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol

15:53:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol man
15:53:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> i lost the scoop to my preworkout
15:54:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> so every time  try to like pour some out into a glass its just a big blueberry lemonade dust explosion
15:54:26 <Nude_Riker> why not use a measuring spoon
15:54:32 <Nude_Riker> or a regular spoon
15:55:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> spoon it directly into your mouth
15:58:59 <dreddybajs> Phil ftw
16:00:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ^
16:02:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> well i could but effort
16:02:25 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dont really measure the shit anyway i just dump some in a glass
16:02:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> i always forget until im already at the dump part
16:03:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> pleemis
16:03:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> i think phil might actually be.... ftl
16:03:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> phil is epic
16:03:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he'sthe dumbest man alive

16:04:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> .seen lol_hehe
16:06:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> it is funny how stupid phil is but i dont understand people who like actively give him money
16:07:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> his freak detractors have doxed a lot of them and they have problems
16:07:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> a few of the big ones are on disability
16:07:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's very sad
16:07:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> people on disability should give me their money instead of phil
16:07:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> same
16:08:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> damn i thought i had a tiny spot of yogurt on ym leg because i was just eating yogurt but it was lotion
16:08:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> tastes terrible

16:52:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have been to berlin and budapest once each and england several times
16:52:51 <registered_mirc> i went to london once and got physically assaulted
16:52:54 <registered_mirc> that was cool
16:52:59 <Melber> north america has been by far the worst of all of them
16:53:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive only been to taiwan in asia
16:53:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wanna go look at my favorite spomenik monuments

16:54:30 <Melber> id really like to go to vietnam but it will be some time for that i imagine

16:54:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive had layovers in airports in a few countries that ive never been outside of the airport in
16:54:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> france, denmark, and iceland
16:55:06 <eric> we just went to angkor wat in cambodia 
16:55:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> angkor wat looks cool

16:55:18 <the`shima> ive never been to asia
16:55:21 <eric> the temples were really cool but ive heard the best stuff is in the south with the islands
16:55:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we shot guns on the cambodian border
16:55:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> how many cambodians did you shoot
16:55:49 <the`shima> furthest east i've been is belgrade
16:55:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> a man offered my dad six pigs for me to live in the village for a week
16:56:02 <eric> good deal
16:56:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i didn't shoot any cambodians
16:56:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> or anyone at all
16:56:30 <Melber> time to go see if i can get a new debit card
16:57:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> vietnam was better than japan ebcause my dad was doingf sex tourism so he wasn't yelling at me
16:57:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> japan he just yelled at me the whole time lol
16:57:23 <eric> japans expensive for a dad
16:57:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> [tune of the john cena theme song] sex tourist dad
16:57:45 <eric> and the sex tourism is probably not as fun there
16:57:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he had child bride AND of age gf to deal with
16:58:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he took us to a massage parlor that was one of Those types of massage parlors
16:58:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
16:58:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and the girls there kept insisting my nose was fake because it was very straight
16:58:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> my former coworker at 7-eleven was an ex-air force guy who was the biggest pervert on the planet
16:58:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> and he was always talking about going to "the rub n tug"
16:59:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my dad used to go to strip clubs and leave me in the car rofl
16:59:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he was "going to eat at the buffet"
16:59:22 <dreddybajs> jesus
16:59:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think he had a military pension and mostly worked at 7-eleven to supplement his "rub n tug" habit
16:59:39 <eric> golly
16:59:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats how i learned about the website rubmaps dot com
16:59:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ahahaha
16:59:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> military dudes are the worst type of horny
17:00:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> father of the year
17:00:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> he also would go to the "nudie beach" a lot and talked about wearing a c-string there, which is how i learned what a c-string is
17:00:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> it is this https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/o1fEBHtU/image.png
17:00:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> the wire goes in between your ass cheeks and i think you can figure out the rest
17:01:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he took me and my friend (who he desperately wished was his son) to japan and even though we kept saying we wanted to do things like go to the ghibli museum or w/e my dad would insist bobby wanted to go look at women
17:01:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> even though he was saying he didn't
17:01:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so we spent a lot of time sitting in the hotel while my dad went off and did stuff
17:02:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> your dad seems like a fucked up guy
17:02:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> my dad mostly eats fast food and listens to christopher hitchens audiobooks
17:03:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my dad has combat ptsd and wishes he never left the army or got old
17:04:32 <eric> im not sure of the details but my friends parents fell in love in thailand when his dad was on vacation 
17:04:48 <eric> and then when he was born he was sent to live as a monk for several years
17:04:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think all of these stories are funny fwiw
17:04:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol cool
17:05:28 <eric> his mom rules shes very cool and nice
17:05:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk if you all knew this but hockey is very good
17:05:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hockey ftw
17:06:00 <eric> theyre recently seperated though and from what i hear his dad has gone back to thailand for round two
17:06:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
17:06:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> shrimp1989dspinfo: check out this stat: igor shesterkin could allow goals on his next 14 shots faced and he would still lead the league in sv%
17:06:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> eyah my dad goes back to his of age vietnamese gf whenever the child bride leaves him for another man
17:06:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/dNaEVdwN/image.png
17:07:02 <dreddybajs> homie in a geod
17:07:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> thadnts me
17:07:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> should i build this dreddybajs https://strategy.channelfireball.com/all-strategy/home/grinding-the-grist-mill-in-commander-edh/
17:07:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> i already have all the expensive pieces really
17:07:51 <eric> can they get one of those 1000 pounds fatsos to sit in the net
17:08:03 <eric> sorry if thats offensive
17:08:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> eric: realistically theres no one who is big enough in the proper shape to block the entire net when stationary
17:08:43 <eric> ah well
17:08:57 <dreddybajs> grist seems sweet yea
17:09:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> they did some sports science show one time where they put like a sumo wrestler in goalie pads in a net and players easily scored on him at will
17:09:32 <eric> but what about those guys who have to get like cut out of their living room
17:09:58 <eric> .gis worlds fattest man
17:10:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> i still dont think any of them are 6 ft wide for an entire 4 feet of height which is what you would have to be to block the net
17:10:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> in its entirety
17:10:19 <eric> .gis absolute unit
17:10:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> and then theres the whole problem of getting the person into pads, and getting them on the ice, and getting them on the team plane
17:10:43 <eric> ive heared about raising to the rafters but lowering from them ??
17:11:12 <eric> i guess if it had been a possibility it would have happened by now
17:11:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> theres simply no one whos big enough to block this entire thing without some gaps https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/4fppZmfU/image.png
17:12:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> and if the gaps are stationary, even if theyre small, nhl players will be able to get pucks into them
17:12:35 <eric> i get it
17:12:57 <eric> we need even larger fatsos
17:13:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> you could probably build a literal brick wall in front of the net with 1 brick missing and it would not be able to stop a % of shots equal to an nhl goaltender
17:13:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> id like to see that tested
17:14:00 <eric> it would be cool to be able to aim well with puck and stick
17:14:15 <eric> being able to consistently knock someones hat off with a beer can would be cool
17:14:43 <dreddybajs> did u guys see that vid of steph curry doing the 15 shot drill recently
17:14:49 <dreddybajs> and he swishes every shot like its nothing
17:15:01 <Nude_Riker> not if i used very small bricks
17:15:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have an nhl sized hockey net drawn in chalk on the back of my garage and i drew targets in the corners and i am Not consistent at hitting them
17:15:19 <eric> sand sized bricks
17:15:19 <dreddybajs> https://twitter.com/StephNationCP/status/1498088275965521921
17:15:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats crazy dreddybajs 
17:15:43 <dreddybajs> nothin but net
17:15:46 <Nude_Riker> yeah when i played hockey i never practiced enough to consistently hit the holes in our "league"s wooden goalie
17:15:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> especially because curry is not an especially tall guy
17:16:08 <eric> gravitys rainbow
17:16:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> like, the mechanics that you need, as a guy who isnt already very tall, to get your release point and shooting arc high enough to do that consistently
17:16:18 <dreddybajs> basketball seems like the sport where most often an athlete gets good enough to just break the game
17:16:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> are insane
17:16:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean its insane even for the tall guys but they have a mechanical advantage
17:16:45 <Nude_Riker> for context, our league was less people than it takes to fill a single full team's roster and we just practiced and played roller hockey on a concrete floor in the 4H building they used for the animal displays at the county fair, that was 1/4 the size of a real rink
17:16:50 <Nude_Riker> no one played goalie ever
17:17:17 <eric> ive only ever played roller hockey in the lane
17:17:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> i only learned how to take a slapshot correctly in hockey this year
17:17:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> im still not very good at it
17:17:31 <Nude_Riker> there were big ass seams between the like sections of concrete and people would eat shit all the time not skipping them lol
17:17:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i never learned how to do it when i played roller hockey as a kid
17:17:47 <Nude_Riker> amazingly we did have boards though
17:17:54 <Nude_Riker> so, i got checked into the boards a lot
17:17:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> no one ever taught me that youre supposed to actually hit the ice (or floor in this case) with the stick before it impacts the puck
17:18:25 <dreddybajs> yeah it's about potential energy or w/e right
17:18:27 <dreddybajs> cool technique
17:19:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah dreddybajs youre loading the stick with energy which flexes and then kind of whips into the puck
17:19:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i am in vc dreddy
17:19:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> that being said back then i used a wooden stick and especially as a kid, good fucking luck getting any flex in that
17:19:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> much easier with a composite
17:19:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's cool wehn the guys snap their sticks from whipping pucks as hard as they can at the net
17:20:43 <eric> yeah when athletes break their gear from playing to hard is some of the most exciting stuff
17:20:49 <eric> like in baseball
17:21:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there's always broken sticks on the ice
17:21:03 <eric> not in tennis when its just people having a fit over getting owned
17:21:16 <eric> yeah i like that theres just a big bucket of sticks to grab from
17:22:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> one of our dudes snapped a stick over his leg after he missed a goal
17:22:57 <Nude_Riker> lol
17:23:06 <eric> sounds like it would hurt but idk
17:23:52 <the_tasteful_nerd> .l
17:23:54 <the_tasteful_nerd> Me
17:24:21 <eric> .g price of a pro hockey stick
17:24:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> theyve got pads on their legs so idk
17:24:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> pro hockey sticks are like 1-200 dollars
17:24:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> actually the ones the nhl players use are probably more than that because theyre specifically made to order for those players
17:25:08 <eric> yeah i reckon so
17:25:14 <eric> high price per unit
17:25:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive seen mlb players break bats over their legs
17:25:20 <eric> jesus
17:25:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> which seems like an insane thing to be able to do
17:25:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn8PfAe_c2I
17:25:34 <eric> i guess they got beefy ones form all the running
17:26:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i can't find a video of him breaking it
17:26:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think its sort of a thing like breaking a cinderblock or a board in martial arts, where theres a specific mechanical way to do it
17:26:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it was rantanen lol
17:26:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> without hurting yourself if you do it right
17:26:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> but it still seems crazy to me
17:27:16 <eric> baseball ftw
17:28:03 <eric> something really satisfying about the basic action of hitting a flying thing with a bat
17:28:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
17:28:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't really "get" baseball
17:28:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like hockey because it's unpredictable
17:28:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> i feel like its much easier to enjoy baseball if you grew up playing it (even just casually)
17:28:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i never played a sport
17:28:59 <eric> my experience going to watch baseball is just having a nice day in the sun with the fellas
17:29:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> well, no, i was on a swim team for a bit
17:29:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> but if youre an observer from like a country where baseball isnt regularly played i dont see it being very enjoyable
17:29:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah eric thats part of it too
17:29:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> you dotn even have to pay attention all the time
17:29:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> it is the best sport for Just Hanging Out
17:29:20 <eric> drinking of beer and cheering when the guy on the field hits the ball good
17:29:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> i guess watching nascar racing is probably about hanging out too
17:29:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> but that shit sucks and is boring
17:29:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my stepdad loves nascar
17:30:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he doesn't hang he watches intently the whole time
17:30:02 <eric> .y pkew pkew pkew hanging out
17:30:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> get this:
17:30:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> Asscar
17:30:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ^
17:30:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> gdi
17:30:28 <the_tasteful_nerd> someone start using the lat pulldown as soon as i got to jim
17:30:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there's a nascar track in my hometown and i worked a race once
17:30:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when i was a teen
17:30:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i worked in a hospitality tent
17:31:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/gifs_bot/status/1500883989925707776
17:31:21 <eric> saras younger sister worked at the baseball stadium here selling hot dogs and beer
17:31:34 <eric> sounds like a good summer job
17:32:08 <eric> very funny to think about dialing into the bbs to see what cool drawings people have put up over night
17:32:15 <eric> and it just looks like that pizza or whatever
17:32:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> wish we could go back
17:33:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/4IiR8qjb/image.png
17:33:25 <eric> on our first computer we had a program that just drew vga pictures on teh screen
17:33:38 <eric> and you could look at a picture of a flower or the space shuttle taking off
17:33:46 <eric> maybe you could get more pictures somehow too
17:33:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's cute
17:37:09 <Nude_Riker> lmao
17:38:23 <Nude_Riker> https://twitter.com/shrimp_delight/status/1500888030789443589
17:38:27 <eric> in retrospect its kind of weird i remember this comptur so well since i must have been mainly used when i was between the ages of 3 and 6
17:38:36 <eric> because im pretty sure we got a new pc to run windows 95
17:38:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> physical shudder ran through my body when i realized what subreddit that was shrimp1989dspinfo 
17:38:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
17:38:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> dont like it one bit
17:39:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah it took me a minute
17:46:32 <eric> did u guys ever sneeze on like your arrm and then smell your arm and you could smeel the sneeze
17:46:41 <dreddybajs> yeah
17:46:59 <eric> smells kind of good but also weird
17:47:22 <Nude_Riker> no
17:47:38 <eric> its a familiar smell thats hard to place 
17:48:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
17:48:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> i know the sneeze smell well
17:48:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> speaking of good, kind of weird smells, i got the boot boyz cologne today
17:48:46 <eric> cool
17:48:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> and, it does indeed smell good and kind of weird
17:49:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> the scent notes (ozone, metal, dust) i kind of thought were just a joke but you actually do get those smells
17:49:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
17:49:09 <eric> i think i understand that notion now
17:49:19 <eric> of like something that doesnt smell good but is beguiling
17:49:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> ya
17:49:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> like your own farts
17:50:44 <Nude_Riker> i wonder how many new employees have clicked on the tab i made in our MS team titled "Teams Etiquette' thats a pdf of bookchin's ecology of freedom
17:50:54 <Nude_Riker> i just put it there to test something and never removed it
17:51:21 <the`shima> Melber i been listening to Yes - Fragile a lot this week
17:51:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> cant stop refreshing usps tracking
17:51:28 <the`shima> some amazing tracks on there...
17:51:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> give me my magic gthe gathering cards...
17:53:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/electricalWSOP/status/1500820427513516035 lol
17:53:45 <Melber> the`shima: hell yeah that's my second favorite yes album
17:54:03 <dreddybajs> jesus, just found out my maths teacher that died walked in front of a train
17:54:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> :|
17:54:12 <dreddybajs> he was in his mid 70s 
17:54:30 <dreddybajs> i wonder if he was terminally ill or something, he was that type of guy who'd do that if so 
17:54:58 <Nude_Riker> wow
17:55:07 <Melber> debit card successfully replaced
17:55:10 <Melber> new ID in the mail
17:55:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> grats
17:57:08 <the`shima> this bass line just rules https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwPWGUhEtP0
17:57:14 <the`shima> whats your fav melber
17:57:24 <Melber> close to the edge
17:57:26 <dreddybajs> absolute tune
17:57:27 <Melber> is like a distant first
17:57:48 <dreddybajs> but the`shima are you aware of this yes-related christmas classic that benji discovered
17:57:51 <dreddybajs> .y run with the fox
17:58:33 <Melber> lmao the beginning of this song sounds so much like the 9/11 conspiracy song
17:58:41 <dreddybajs> it's so good
17:58:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> this is a good wikipedia article
17:58:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariko_Aoki_phenomenon
17:59:13 <the`shima> this is very catchy
17:59:19 <the`shima> yeah i immediately thought of martin noakes
17:59:44 <Melber> anyway the`shima i could go on for ages about it but basically
17:59:53 <Nude_Riker> roundabout ftw
18:00:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> damn there’s a full of hell show with artificial brain at vitus later this month
18:00:25 <het> I agree with Melber on yes
18:00:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wonder what artificial brain sound like with their new singer
18:00:37 <het> roundabout is very good but close to the edge is the king
18:00:50 <het> no other album has siberian khatru
18:00:59 <Nude_Riker> .y yes close to the edge
18:01:12 <Nude_Riker> .y yes siberian khatru
18:01:21 <Melber> roundabout is where i think yes started to figure out their sound - it's the first album where you sort of consistently see them doing those grander arrangements
18:01:43 <Nude_Riker> having trouble imagining a to be continued screen with the intro to this song
18:01:49 <the`shima> siberian khatru is some mario kart sounding stuff
18:01:55 <Nude_Riker> lol
18:02:07 <Melber> and they really leaned into that on close to the edge, and then bill bruford left because he apparently believed the band wouldn't be able to make a better album than that and it turns out he was right
18:02:37 <Melber> cuz closest they came after that was either relayer or going for the one and those both have some real clunkers on em
18:02:50 <the`shima> i really like heart of the sunrise but i think its cuase it has alan parsons vibes too
18:03:34 <the`shima> seen a lot of people uniornically getting onto the beegees recently
18:03:44 <Melber> well, the beegees are good
18:03:55 <Melber> the`shima: here's like my favorite drum part ever: https://youtu.be/51oPKLSuyQY?t=850
18:04:01 <Nude_Riker> do people ironically get into things these days
18:04:09 <the`shima> yeah steely dan
18:04:16 <Nude_Riker> people seem quite genuine about that
18:04:20 <dreddybajs> no, steely dan are unironically good
18:04:24 <the`shima> they are lying to themselves
18:04:31 <dreddybajs> foolish.
18:04:33 <Nude_Riker> i will remain committed to not finding out what steely dan sounds like
18:04:47 <the`shima> i tried. i couldnt see the appeal tbh
18:05:02 <Melber> i like steely dan quite a bit
18:05:04 <bonegar> im not sure there is anything unique about steely dan's sound
18:05:06 <Nude_Riker> i would say 60% of the people i see into steely dan around my age are also into jam bands, so
18:05:12 <bonegar> in think the absence of uniqueness is the interesting thing
18:05:30 <Melber> that is incorrect
18:05:32 <bonegar> it's just hyper produced pre-digital era soft-rock
18:05:34 <bonegar> no it isn'
18:05:39 <bonegar> im very right about this
18:05:44 <Nude_Riker> like their whole thing is technical proficiency isnt it? revenge of the session musicians
18:05:46 <het> 18:01 < the`shima> siberian khatru is some mario kart sounding stuff
18:05:47 <het> wtf
18:06:10 <dreddybajs> dont bother melber... we steely stans are better than this
18:06:15 <bonegar> more like studio musicians
18:06:17 <the`shima> its good but it sounds like mario kart track music
18:06:23 <the`shima> the main riff
18:06:33 <bonegar> which maybe are session musicians idk
18:06:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> i know steely dan sounds like uh lord tariq & peter gunz deja vu
18:06:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> but thats it
18:06:38 <Melber> Nude_Riker: i mean technical proficiency is part of it, but not in like the dream theater kind of way
18:06:55 <the`shima> i was surprised to hear that michael mcdonald was in steely dan becuase i like michael mcdonald a lot
18:07:13 <dreddybajs> the technical proficiency is more on the interesting songwriting side of things than like virtuosity and improv
18:07:22 <Melber> i mean "in" is probably not the correct term
18:07:28 <Melber> he sings on a couple of the songs
18:07:29 <dreddybajs> yeah he did vocal work for them
18:07:44 <bonegar> they're yachtrock for guys who are scared of water
18:07:54 <bonegar> .yt steely dan deacon blues
18:07:54 <the`shima> im very confused by this track btw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGrQTRcxdTo
18:08:04 <the`shima> extremely weird aesthetic
18:08:06 <het> the`shima: main riff fucking owns what are you talking about
18:08:16 <the`shima> im not saying its bad lol
18:08:23 <the`shima> it just reminds me of a frantic mario kart track
18:08:24 <Melber> yeah het i dont think he meant it as an insult
18:08:33 <Melber> like if i said something sounded like f zero
18:08:35 <Melber> that's high praise
18:08:38 <Nude_Riker> im sure no one will agree with me about this but i think my steely dan is jimmy buffet
18:08:45 <bonegar> to me, at least, the entire appeal of steely dan is the cornball polish
18:08:50 <het> oh I guess, sure
18:09:01 <het> this is maybe the best clickhole headline ever https://clickhole.com/mandela-effect-hundreds-of-people-remember-you-as-a-complete-loser-in-high-school/
18:09:18 <Nude_Riker> hell yeah now im listening to jimmy buffett
18:09:22 <bonegar> can you expand on steelydan is to jimmy buffet analogy?
18:09:35 <Nude_Riker> im not sure i can explain it, i just feel it
18:09:46 <eric> we watched the fiorst couple episodes of after party on recommendation (terrible show) 
18:09:49 <the`shima> christ checking lastfm
18:09:54 <bonegar> like kinda old guys who lie a lot and maybe are in the vague same wealth pool? like i imagine they meet eachother at various conferences
18:09:58 <the`shima> since january ive listened to over 800 inxs tracks ll
18:10:03 <Nude_Riker> i doubt they share just about anything in common musically
18:10:05 <het> I feel like I can see it insofar as steely dan and jimmy buffett are enjoyed by weed dads
18:10:13 <bonegar> yeah i can absolutely see the same energy in it
18:10:15 <Nude_Riker> yeah its more about that
18:10:16 <eric> but to make it even worse the premise is people in their 30s who havent changed since high school and still think constantly about people from high school
18:10:16 <the`shima> what about Frank Zappa
18:10:17 <Melber> the steely dan guys are absolutely not in the same wealth pool as jimmy buffet
18:10:29 <Melber> as the latter is one of the richest musicians in the world
18:10:47 <bonegar> zappa is the guy who refused to shower and was asked to leave the club
18:10:52 <het> well there's no Aja restaurant in times square, yes
18:11:05 <Nude_Riker> like the parrotheads and steely dan fans probably hate each other, but they resemble each other in my mind
18:11:09 <eric> its like a high school movie for people in their 30s where the tropes are just the same
18:11:13 <eric> bad show dont watch
18:11:14 <bonegar> yea i get what matt is saying
18:11:23 <dreddybajs> heh, just found out that my maths teacher did have a cancer diagnosis
18:11:26 <dreddybajs> nailed it :(
18:11:29 <Nude_Riker> :(
18:11:49 <het> dreddybajs: damn

18:39:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmao https://twitter.com/HoneydewWilkins/status/1500895472457760770
18:42:14 <the`shima> lmao is that real
18:42:27 -!- lettrist [~letty@synIRC-77688CA5.dyn.plus.net] has joined #phiz
18:45:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> it seems to be slightly edited but she still looks like shit the`shima https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/queen-hosts-trudeau-first-person-engagement-covid-diagnosis-rcna19011
18:46:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> actually it might be unedited lol
18:48:45 <scoop_jackson> Steely Dan ain’t bad
18:49:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats right
18:49:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> .y black cow
18:50:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> if it wasnt for the dan, this rap shit probably never would be goin... in
18:50:13 <scoop_jackson> Lol
18:50:35 <ajj> lol
18:51:08 <registered_mirc> lol insane elden ring wrong warp discovered yesterday
18:51:47 <dreddybajs> lol really
18:51:48 <dreddybajs> what is it
18:53:12 <registered_mirc> the grace in front of rykard can be glitched using a quit out, so if you die and get sent back to that grace, then run to some area, such as the lasta area in the game, and then quit out, it will respawn you in the default start of that area
18:53:39 <registered_mirc> the theory is the grace is on a slope so it doesn't save position
18:53:59 <bonegar> yea the game is a little weird about closing out of it for some reason
18:54:10 <dreddybajs> lol that rocks
18:54:21 <registered_mirc> souls has always been kinda interesting with quit outs and how it saves position
18:54:29 <registered_mirc> this is probably going to be patched tho
18:54:34 <the`shima> did charlie rose ever go to prison
18:54:48 <bonegar> the interviewer guy?
18:54:50 <bonegar> what'd he do
18:55:32 <the`shima> sexually assaulted someobdy i think
18:55:35 <greatest_gamer> he let his kimono fall open in the square.
18:55:55 <the`shima> On November 20, 2017, eight women who were employees of, or aspired to work for Rose, accused him of various acts of sexual misconduct including harassment, groping, and making lewd phone calls. 
18:57:16 <bonegar> lol it'd be cool to hear those phone calls
18:57:18 <bonegar> wonder what he said
19:04:45 <Nude_Riker> .y best of charlie rose
19:04:49 <Nude_Riker> lol
19:05:35 <Nude_Riker> so far these are not creepy

19:25:13 <Melber> Just give myself a deeply unpleasant experience 
19:26:30 <registered_mirc> damn, if a pop is deeply unpleasant
19:29:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
19:29:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> a nitro brewed soda is the stupidest fucking idea i have heard of recently
19:29:34 <Nude_Riker> lmao
19:29:47 <Nude_Riker> 'you know what i want is a soda thats Smooth'
19:29:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have received the rest of the cards i was waiting for for sydneys deck (except i also ordered 3 more cards that will not come for a few more days but i have things i can play instead of those for now)
19:30:07 <Nude_Riker> i dont even like nitro beer most of the time
19:30:32 <dreddybajs> dex bleed build is so fun in elden
19:30:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> im generally ambivalent about nitro beer but it is certainly a better idea than nitro soda
19:31:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> dreddybajs: what do you think for making 2 cuts here https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/4647812#paper
19:31:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> i kinda wanna see how the deck plays manawise, if its consistently doing well on that front i'll cut abundant harvest
19:33:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> maybe one of the vehicles
19:33:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> raise the alarm is still borderline but it does seem like a decent value play in all phases of the game so i'm leaning towards keeping it
19:34:03 <Nude_Riker> nitro cold brew is one of the few nitro things i think is good, but i also wont ever buy it
19:34:36 <dreddybajs> hmm probably 1-2 of the protection spells Homie_in_a_geod ?you should be able to rebuild quickly after a wrath anyway right
19:34:40 <dreddybajs> so i dont think you need so many
19:34:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh yeah actually
19:34:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> unbreakable formation is probably the worst of those
19:35:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> although it can be a finisher
19:35:42 <registered_mirc> it is almost pizza time for lunch
19:35:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> so actually make a stand is worse
19:36:09 <dreddybajs> yteah agreed
19:36:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> how do you feel about dryad arbor being in the deck strictly as a crew enabler in the early game
19:36:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think my pod was ever a 'bolt your dryad arbor on t1' kind of group
19:37:26 <dreddybajs> hm
19:37:30 <dreddybajs> seems a bit weak to me
19:37:31 <dreddybajs> but idk
19:38:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> it's definitely weak but my thinking is the main drawback (vulnerability to removal) is not really a drawback because no one will want to waste a removal spell on it
19:38:22 <dreddybajs> it does set you back if you get wrathed though
19:38:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> gets hit by wraths but that doesnt really bother me either at that point in the game
19:38:35 <dreddybajs> hm yea
19:38:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> i also have a bunch of convoke stuff which it can enable the turn it's played
19:39:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> which is kind of cute
19:39:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean, so can a forest, obviously
19:39:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> but just in terms of limiting one of its inherent drawbacks
19:40:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think the upside of being able to crew caravan or bankbuster if i only have emmara and havent made any other tokens yet is enough to keep it in
19:41:13 <dreddybajs> yeah that makes sense
19:41:30 <dreddybajs> maybe it randomly saves emmara from an edict sometime too
19:41:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> mm yeah true
19:42:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> that will be helpful for syd against my tergrid deck lol
19:42:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think my tergrid deck might be inadvertently too spiky lol
19:43:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have just absolutely mopped the floor with sydney every time i've played her with it but then again she is playing a creature deck and it's 1v1
19:44:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> according to mtggoldfish my ragavan went up $15 today
19:45:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> badass
19:45:38 <dreddybajs> yeah cause they didnt ban it
19:45:40 <dreddybajs> makes sense
19:45:42 <dreddybajs> rip lurrus lol
19:45:44 <dreddybajs> fuckin stupid card
19:45:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh was there a banned/restricted today
19:45:56 <dreddybajs> yea lurrus banned in modern and pioneer
19:45:59 <dreddybajs> and some pauper stuff
19:46:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> having player bowl for lunch
19:46:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> rip lurrus
19:46:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> a huge fuckin mistake of a card
19:46:20 <dreddybajs> also, wts 1 lurrus
19:46:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://www.playabowls.com/
19:46:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have lurrus as my commander in my idiotic combo edh deck
19:46:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i dont actually use lurrus
19:46:56 <bonegar> .gis playerbowl food
19:46:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> i could have picked any bw commander
19:47:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/4326639#paper
19:48:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> damn im surprised disciple was legal in pauper before now
19:48:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> really powerful card
19:50:53 <dreddybajs> any arcane chads in the chat https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/VfpJLNpN/image.png
19:52:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> going to a lot of show's this week
19:52:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> seeing the microphones tomorrow, and then iceage the day after, and the armed the day after that
19:53:07 <dreddybajs> damn hell yeah
19:53:14 <dreddybajs> i didnt know microphones were touring
19:53:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> ya its pubeman's first tour as the microphones in like 15 years
19:53:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> no dead wife songs this time
19:53:53 <dreddybajs> yeah i didnt go when he was touring that
19:53:54 <dreddybajs> too sad 
19:54:00 <dreddybajs> even though it's incredible stuff
19:54:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> i did and it was extremely good but definitely not something i need to do more than once
19:57:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l
19:57:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> pog
19:57:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> they named themselves a thing u can abbreviate 'pog' because thats what u say whren u hear them
19:58:22 <registered_mirc> poggers
20:00:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> holy shit lmfao
20:00:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/benjanun_s/status/1500449954783186944
20:00:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> what the fuck
20:04:05 -!- this_fellow_kermit [uid252679@synIRC-E4851C6.helmsley.irccloud.com] has joined #phiz
20:04:45 <registered_mirc> he sounds like he's trying to be as racist as DFW
20:04:48 <dreddybajs> lol Homie_in_a_geod 
20:04:53 <dreddybajs> reading that in the billy crystal jazz man voice
20:05:13 <registered_mirc> wardine be cry
20:05:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> its a she but yeah registered_mirc 
20:05:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> this reply is also very funny to me https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/glkYknmn/image.png
20:06:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> "I don't speak AAVE but generally I can understand what's being said"
20:06:20 <ajj> lmao
20:06:46 <the_tasteful_nerd> .l
20:06:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> is there some strain of wokeness now where we have to treat AAVE as a completely distinct language from english
20:06:56 <the_tasteful_nerd> yes
20:07:00 <dreddybajs> lol
20:07:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> the anthropologist's view
20:07:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> seems counterproductive to me
20:07:26 <the_tasteful_nerd> it is!
20:07:53 <registered_mirc> woken brain
20:08:13 <dreddybajs> irish people love aave because it has similar constructions to hiberno-english
20:08:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> i love aave because all of my favorite rap songs are written in it. and also, it has the n word
20:08:44 <registered_mirc> remember when it was called "jive"
20:08:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
20:08:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> do people still say ebonics
20:09:05 <registered_mirc> im sure some people do
20:09:08 <dreddybajs> big L doesn't (he's dead)
20:09:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think ebonics is a better name honestly
20:09:38 <dreddybajs> i never thought of ebony being the root of ebonics until just now
20:09:38 <dreddybajs> huh
20:09:50 <registered_mirc> AAVE sounds more technical tho, which allows a person to gain some distance from being labelled a racist
20:09:54 <registered_mirc> ...right? :D
20:10:04 <dreddybajs> not sure what you're going for there tbh
20:10:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> registered_mirc: i mean it sounds more technical but like, i think that's bad
20:10:15 <registered_mirc> yes
20:10:17 <registered_mirc> that is what i am saying
20:10:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> like other languages dont have some name that was dreamed up in an academic context
20:10:26 <registered_mirc> being technical as a means to gain distance from a thing
20:10:28 <registered_mirc> like irony
20:10:35 <dreddybajs> yes they do, i literally just mentioned hiberno-english for example
20:10:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> why should this one, if you want to treat it as a fully distinct language
20:11:07 <registered_mirc> we should dutifully categorize things
20:11:09 <dreddybajs> i think a dialect having a formalised technical name gives it legitimacy in the white middle class world
20:11:14 <dreddybajs> so it's probably important in that regard
20:11:24 <Nude_Riker> AAVE is PMC
20:11:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> its a private military contractor?
20:12:00 <registered_mirc> being technical also allows the white man to chin stroke about it
20:12:05 <Nude_Riker> thats right, it is the new name for akademi
20:12:30 <dreddybajs> don't think so, people can chin stroke about it whether theyre calling it aave or ebonics or pidgin or jive
20:12:54 <registered_mirc> thats true, they can, and do
20:13:44 <dreddybajs> and i have no idea about this, but i would guess it's likely that black academic voices had a lot to do with formalisation and legitimisation of their dialect
20:14:05 <dreddybajs> supposing that it's somehow a white chin stroking pursuit is a bit out of left field to me
20:14:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> im going to conjecture (maybe optimistically) that AAVE as a term was probably coined or popularized by a black academic; however i also dont think it should be up to academics of any race to come up with the name of a language
20:14:57 <Nude_Riker> .g history of the term aave
20:15:14 <registered_mirc> boing
20:15:28 <dreddybajs> i dont think i have any opinion on who should and should not come up with the name of languages
20:15:31 <Nude_Riker> damn, doesnt say who coined it
20:15:46 <registered_mirc> academia coined ebonics tho
20:15:57 <registered_mirc> we know that much
20:18:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> dreddybajs: i think a decent rule of thumb would be that the name for a language should align generally with whatever any random native speaker of the language would call it (ie their response to 'what language do you speak')
20:18:59 <dreddybajs> right but i think if you asked an african-american that they'd respond "english"
20:19:09 <dreddybajs> so it falls upon academics to define the dialects within that further
20:19:13 <Nude_Riker> right
20:19:20 <Nude_Riker> they are not separate languages
20:19:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> right but thats the distinction between a language and a dialect
20:19:33 <dreddybajs> im...aware of that...
20:19:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> as opposed to two completely separate languages, which is how apparently some people want to treat them
20:19:41 <dreddybajs> but the conversation is about the name of a dialect
20:19:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> that was my point
20:19:57 <dreddybajs> im confused but i think we agree on that
20:20:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> i do too
20:20:10 <registered_mirc> i think you should fight to the death anyway
20:20:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats right.
20:20:22 <dreddybajs> love when elden ring crashes and then scolds me for not quitting properly
20:20:30 <registered_mirc> it is your fault
20:20:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> its supposed to be a hard game ciaran.
20:21:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> if you cant deal with that part of the difficulty curve go play bejeweled.
20:21:07 <registered_mirc> lmao
20:21:09 <dreddybajs> >:(
20:21:27 <registered_mirc> tom that was the perfect "cool guy internet gamer" voice
20:21:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
20:21:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> it would be cool to design a game that is deliberately buggy and the 'game' is based on circumventing the bugs
20:21:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> has anyone tried to do that before
20:22:05 <registered_mirc> lol
20:22:08 <registered_mirc> game dev simulator
20:22:09 <dreddybajs> yes, it's called street fighter 2 and it's the greatest game of all time
20:22:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
20:22:36 <dreddybajs> (what im referring to is cancels in street fighter 2 were originally a bug)
20:22:38 <Nude_Riker> if they are intentional they are not bugs
20:22:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> at some point the game stops launching because files are corrupted and you have to figure out how to uncorrupt the files to continue
20:22:47 <dreddybajs> and are the foundations of combos in fighting games ever since
20:23:02 <registered_mirc> more interested in guile handcuffs
20:23:25 <dreddybajs> lol Homie_in_a_geod that just unlocked a deep teenage web memory for me: does anyone remember a website game that was basically a "hacking" game and every level you had to do more and more intricate stuff to figure out the next url
20:23:38 <dreddybajs> like at the start it was an invisible jpg, then it was you had to open the source for the webpage, etc
20:23:44 <dreddybajs> like 2006 era probably
20:23:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> no shit Nude_Riker
20:23:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> no shit Nude_Riker 
20:24:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> the idea is to deliberately program in things that present as bugs and you can have weird shit happen with save files and whatever and it is a kind of puzzle to figure it out
20:24:04 <dreddybajs> no SHIT matt
20:24:04 <registered_mirc> lol
20:24:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk why that happened irccloud was being weird.
20:24:21 <registered_mirc> yeah that sounds too much like my job
20:24:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> i did not mean to curse at matt twice, just once
20:24:23 <registered_mirc> no thanks
20:24:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> until he says some other pedantic shit
20:24:43 <dreddybajs> its happening to me lately because my switch controller i play elden ring on is fucked up on windows and using it sometimes triggers things in my irccloud window
20:24:48 <dreddybajs> like up arrow to repeat previous text
20:25:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> i never played or even know much about undertale but it is my understandign that there was some weird stuff with save files built into the game or something
20:25:06 <Nude_Riker> i think the stanley parable does that and that guys other projects do similar things
20:25:24 <dreddybajs> mgs2...
20:25:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> and uh what was that fake japanese vn game that people liked
20:25:36 <dreddybajs> doki doki literature club?
20:25:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> doki doki literature club yeah
20:25:50 <Nude_Riker> i started that and quit before i ever got to the weird stuff
20:26:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l
20:26:16 <registered_mirc> lol that game looks ridiculous
20:26:21 <dreddybajs> it's really good
20:26:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> hes doing a really good mark lanegan impression on this one the_tasteful_nerd 
20:26:22 <registered_mirc> non-starter
20:26:26 <the_tasteful_nerd> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/xpU7GANq/image.png
20:26:27 <dreddybajs> rip mark lanegan
20:26:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> almost feels like a tribute... what did he know...
20:26:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
20:26:39 <dreddybajs> registered_mirc: im not a VN guy but someone convinced me to play that and im glad i did
20:26:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> hank gribbohm
20:26:48 <registered_mirc> looks like weeb shit idk
20:26:49 <registered_mirc> not for me
20:27:06 <dreddybajs> well yes its a fuckin anime visual novel
20:27:09 <Nude_Riker> VNs: click to continue
20:27:26 <dreddybajs> (mpg watching anime) this is like a damn cartoon
20:27:26 <registered_mirc> im a game developer!
20:27:29 <Nude_Riker> most VNs fail to meet the qualifications for game, but that one i think is supposed to
20:27:34 <registered_mirc> anime are cartoons yes
20:27:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah registered_mirc the idea is that it starts off that way and then some weird and creepy shit happens
20:27:44 <registered_mirc> thank you for sarcastically clearing that up for me
20:28:06 <dreddybajs> it wasnt sarcasm, it was satire
20:28:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont especially care to play it but it seems like it was a good idea
20:28:11 <registered_mirc> whatever you say!
20:28:18 <dreddybajs> u mad?
20:28:24 <registered_mirc> i mean
20:28:26 <registered_mirc> you can fuck off
20:28:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> dont fight friends.
20:28:45 <dreddybajs> i fell down a hole and died 
20:28:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> i have purchased thew new crazzy mountain dew flavor
20:28:53 <dreddybajs> what is it will
20:28:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> down in a hole..............
20:29:01 <the_tasteful_nerd> lost alll my souuuuulls......
20:29:05 <dreddybajs> lol
20:29:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> i think its like raspberyry lemonade?
20:29:14 <Melber> Got 2 figure out what 2 do with this pork belly
20:29:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> raspberyry
20:29:23 <registered_mirc> eat it
20:29:25 <registered_mirc> raw
20:29:26 <Melber> Preferably with the Kimchi I made
20:29:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> this mf said raspberyry
20:30:01 <dreddybajs> Melber: bulgogi seems like the obvious answer
20:30:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> you could do ramen too
20:30:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah make some sort of gochujang glaze
20:30:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive never worked with pork belly before it seems hard to do right
20:30:51 <Melber> I do not know how to make bulgogi and this seems like an expensive way to figure it out
20:30:57 <dreddybajs> ask stav on twitter
20:31:00 <registered_mirc> Homie_in_a_geod: not if you have an instant pot
20:31:01 <dreddybajs> he's the pork belly king
20:31:06 <dreddybajs> oh no wait that's pork shoulder he likes
20:31:08 <registered_mirc> it's brainless with an instant pot
20:31:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> pork shoulder ftw
20:31:21 <Melber> Homie_in_a_geod: I mean it depends, it's easy on a smoker or something
20:31:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> sydney made carnitas last night with some pork shoulder
20:31:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> and mac & cheese
20:31:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> 😋
20:31:41 <Melber> The problem with doing it on a smoker is that takes forever
20:31:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> a smoker is not a particularly easy thing to have in new york city
20:31:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i do have an instant pot
20:32:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> i would just braise it with a vaguely korean braising liquid
20:32:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah fish sauce and gochujang
20:32:14 <registered_mirc> i never made it before and did it with an instant pot and it was pretty much perfect
20:32:16 <Melber> I'm just saying it can be very easy with the right tools 
20:32:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> gochujang+soy+rice vinegar+sesame oil
20:32:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> that sounds good
20:32:19 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah and fish sauce
20:32:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> fish sauce ftw
20:32:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> indeed
20:32:34 <Melber> Maybe I should wait until this weekend so I'm not eating it all by myself
20:32:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> they always make fish sauce caramel on masterchef australia
20:32:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> im curious about that
20:32:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> hm
20:32:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> interesting
20:33:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> what do they use it for
20:33:07 <Nude_Riker> i like to eat the crusted fish sauce around the top of the bottle >:)
20:33:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> freak
20:33:15 <Nude_Riker> its like candy
20:33:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> settle down
20:33:35 <Nude_Riker> you should try it
20:33:45 <dreddybajs> :|
20:33:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> i'm fine continuing not to be a freak
20:34:06 <Nude_Riker> sorry you are too afraid to experience flavor

20:46:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> fuckin hideous
20:46:55 <registered_mirc> they make me feel nostalgic
20:47:00 <registered_mirc> i like playing with revised cards
20:47:16 <registered_mirc> my lightning bolts are revised
20:47:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean dont get me wrong id be happy to have some white border duals or other cool shit
20:47:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> i just think the borders look terrible
20:47:48 <registered_mirc> im more offended by the digital painting art than anything else
20:47:54 <registered_mirc> bring back oil painters
20:48:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> its unfortunate that the best current artist they employ has turned out to be an antivax guy
20:48:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
20:48:26 <registered_mirc> lol
20:48:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> his art still rips though
20:48:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/wJHKjO76/image.png
20:49:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/XZn6XMYo/image.png

20:49:17 <dreddybajs> yeah he rocks
20:49:19 <registered_mirc> they should hire some actual metal artists to do art
20:49:25 <registered_mirc> lewandowski magic cards
20:49:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> it would kick ass if they had lewandowski do card art
20:49:46 <registered_mirc> yeah
20:49:48 <dreddybajs> https://cdn.inprnt.com/thumbs/1d/ed/1dedea816054bdf46a35c018e3482138.jpg?response-cache-control=max-age=2628000
20:49:53 <dreddybajs> i love this one
20:50:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah its great
20:50:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> his stasis is great too
20:50:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/KS80Uquy/image.png
20:50:25 <dreddybajs> i dont mind that hes antivax so much, i was concerned that he was going to the convoy protest shit 
20:50:31 <dreddybajs> but it seems like hes just a real dumbass, not a fascist
20:50:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah exactly
20:50:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> just stupid
20:51:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> although honestly like... i do not understand how a person who is generally decent at all ever gets it in their head that "we need to stand up for medical freedom" or whatever bullshit
20:51:36 <dreddybajs> yeah and also is okay with standing alongside literal swastikas for that purpose
20:59:18 <the_tasteful_nerd> this shirt ftw https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/DXdZXbCP/1646686753.JPG
20:59:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> dreddybajs: yeah i mean i think that shit for most people just comes down to strictly not even thinking about it
20:59:25 <the_tasteful_nerd> band shirts that arent black ftw
20:59:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> most of the rank and file people on the right simply do not practice introspection
21:00:02 <dreddybajs> true... probably equally true for liberals
21:00:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
21:02:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> the ones who do have some degree of introspection on the right have very little in the way of consternation about handwaving away things like some people with nazi flags at the protest as 'that wasnt what it was about and those people dont represent me, personally, or this whole event'
21:02:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> speaking of handwaving problematic elements away
21:02:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l
21:02:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> more band shirts that are not black or white please
21:02:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> maybe more like footwaving
21:03:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> im wearing duff's anniversary tshirt
21:03:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah well i think they can be introspective to a degree but are quite eager to accept any explication of the world as it is that doesnt implicate them as part of the problem
21:04:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> yup
21:04:36 <dreddybajs> Homie_in_a_geod: yeah there's a great free book called The Authoritarians by bob altemeyer that explains that on the right - their fear response to feeling unsafe wrt to terrorism/war/freedoms being taken away is so strong that they're willing to handwave away almost any negative about a leader that will make them feel safe on those issues
21:04:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.instagram.com/p/CYw6qXFpzc5/ this is the shirt im wearing but im not taking a pic of myself because i havent showered
21:04:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i look like shit
21:05:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> sounds about right dreddybajs 
21:05:02 <dreddybajs> https://theauthoritarians.org/ from 2006, still very worth reading imo
21:05:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
21:05:12 <the_tasteful_nerd> good shirt
21:05:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> you never went to duffs did you
21:05:26 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dont believe so
21:05:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> damn we gotta fix that next time you come through nyc
21:05:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> duffs ftmfw
21:06:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think i wasnt really hip to duffs yet the time you came and stayed with me
21:06:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> which is stupid because i definitely should have been
21:07:29 <the_tasteful_nerd> oh ok right in the middle of wmsburg huh
21:07:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah right off the marcy j train
21:07:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> i feel like i may have walked past it but i havent been in
21:08:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk if you would have walked past it, the 'heart' of what people think of as williamsburg is a good bit north/west of there
21:08:30 <the_tasteful_nerd> oh yeah its like right around the corner from that airbnb apt we stayed in a long time
21:08:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> ago
21:08:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh nvm in that case
21:09:01 <Melber> judge today was remarkably respectful of my trans client, did a p good job for an old white dude
21:09:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> anyway it owns
21:09:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> i knew i had been in that area for some reason
21:09:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> nice
21:09:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> did you go to a show at baby's all right
21:09:54 <the_tasteful_nerd> is that where we saw ovlov?
21:10:02 <the_tasteful_nerd> no it was somewhere else
21:10:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> no we saw ovlov at silent barn
21:10:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah
21:10:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> i guess not then
21:10:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> i remember one night we saw part of a show at baby's all right and then went to secret project robot and saw... i guess it was sewingneedle that night
21:10:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i dont think everyone was at the thing at baby's
21:10:46 <dreddybajs> lmao
21:10:56 <dreddybajs> buí crawled in the cutlery drawer while my mam had it open
21:11:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> man what the hell was the show at baby's
21:11:08 <dreddybajs> and my mam closed it because she was nervous buí would fall down the back of the drawers
21:11:17 <dreddybajs> so we just had an emergency cat drawer extraction situation
21:11:17 <the_tasteful_nerd> that might have been something u saw w/ alex before i got there
21:11:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> that seems correct to me but im not sure
21:11:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> another time that alex was here we saw chui wan and carsick cars at babys but there was also something i saw at babys when other people were here
21:11:56 <the_tasteful_nerd> cause when i was up there we saw the ovlov/bad history month show and the skeletonwitch/oathbreaker show
21:12:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> and i think thats it
21:12:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh right
21:12:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah you werent here for prf
21:12:37 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah i was going to but then Had a dang son instead
21:12:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> idiot.
21:13:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh it was grlwood that we saw at baby's
21:13:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think

21:14:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> remember when  was going to have a good time in pittsburgh seeing friends and cool metal bands but then instead spent like 5 days in the hospital
21:14:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> I*
21:15:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> please refer to this for my position on that question dreddybajs 
21:15:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> 4:02 PM <Homie_in_a_geod> speaking of handwaving problematic elements away

21:15:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmfao
21:16:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> lmao
21:17:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> Homie_in_a_geod: I was listening to to this EP by a sludge/death metal band called Ashbreather
21:17:58 <the_tasteful_nerd> and they have Lil B on the third track
21:18:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
21:18:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> https://ashbreather.bandcamp.com/album/ow-my-eye
21:18:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
21:18:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> does that mean lil b has a m-a page
21:18:58 <the_tasteful_nerd> hmm let's see
21:18:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Lil_B/924889
21:19:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> yes he does
21:19:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> yup
21:19:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> lmao
21:19:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think i might have discovered this when i was looking for funny m-a pages
21:19:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> i thought it was a joke or just some old recorded sample at first
21:19:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> cause the song is like 9 min long
21:19:54 <the_tasteful_nerd> but then he shows up and spits a verse
21:19:54 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
21:20:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
21:20:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l
21:20:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> ftw
21:20:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> this new posthumous king von is good 
21:20:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> rip :(
21:20:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> :/
21:21:30 <greatest_gamer> drill time
21:21:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> greetings greatest_gamer
21:22:01 <greatest_gamer> hi cutie
21:22:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> :)
21:22:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> i had something to ask you but now i cannot remember what it was
21:23:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> it probably had to do with working out
21:23:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> i am currently in the 'i need to work out' phase of the cycle that i go through every so often which goes not working out and vehemently hating the concept of working out -> i need to work out -> working out for a while -> get frustrated with lack of results and stop working out
21:25:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l
21:25:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> im not sure i care for this type of thing anymore
21:27:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> my best advice in that regard is to: pick something, and make sure its easy as possible at first, but remain consistent
21:28:28 <the_tasteful_nerd> and also in order to get good results you need to kinda figure out what you want those results to be so you can tailor whatever you do towards that
21:28:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> i would like to lose fat and water weight
21:28:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> moreso than anything
21:29:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> and also just keep in in mind that results can take a while to make themselves apparent but consistency is the key and _something_ is better than nothing, always, even if its pretty easy and low intensity
21:29:20 <the_tasteful_nerd> well that stuff is largely diet
21:29:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont really care that much about getting strong
21:29:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> BUT building muscle over time can help increase your metabolism, which helps
21:30:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> id like to start doing stationary bike stuff 
21:30:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> we're going to get a new stationary bike soon
21:31:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> if im going to diet i could probably use some resources for that
21:31:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk how to fuckin diet effectively
21:31:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> eat less calories
21:31:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> my best recommendation is to use macrofactor
21:31:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah but i also dont have any idea how to count calories
21:31:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> which costs money but is extremely effective
21:32:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> and sydney cooks most of the food
21:32:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> do you have a food scale
21:32:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> we do
21:33:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> macrofactor makes it about as easy as it can be to count calories and you dont have to nail the number exactly for it to figure out where you need to be calorically 
21:33:12 <the_tasteful_nerd> you can create a "recipe" with all the ingredients in their proportions
21:33:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> it feels like such a fuckin lift to incorporate that shit into my routine but i guess i can try it
21:33:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> how much does it cost
21:33:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> and then when you give yourself a serving jus weigh how much of that food you are eating 
21:33:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> and log it as "i ate 400g of CHicken Stew"
21:33:56 <the_tasteful_nerd> its like 55-60 bucks a year
21:34:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> hm
21:34:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats not so bad i guess
21:34:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> there are monthly and 6 month memberships too but theyre more expensive on the month
21:34:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> i would recommend you download that, and get used to just logging what you eat
21:34:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> and not even bother changing anything about your diet
21:35:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean changing anything about my diet would have to be pretty gradual anyway because id need to incorporate doing actual meal prep and shit and i dont do any of that
21:35:37 <the_tasteful_nerd> trust me when i say you dont rly have to go whole hog there
21:35:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> i would just log
21:35:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> all it needs is logging of food thats accurate to about +/i 30% of whateverr the actual value is, and logging your weight
21:35:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> we would need to get a scale too because we don't have one
21:36:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> a person scale
21:36:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> and over about 1-2 weeks it will zero in on what your total daily energy expenditure 
21:36:11 <the_tasteful_nerd> is
21:36:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> which is a kind of annoying fuckin thing to store anyway
21:36:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> i guess we're going to ikea soon, they probably have bathroom scales
21:36:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> and then you can just tell it at what rate you want to lose, gain, or maintain
21:36:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> and it will tell you what calorie range to shoot for
21:37:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> alright
21:37:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> ill give it a shot
21:37:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> it's remarkably good at what it does if you can be consistent with it. once you use it for a while too it remembers what foods you eat at what times
21:37:46 <the_tasteful_nerd> and suggests them to you
21:37:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> im trying to keep an open mind but i am extremely full of internal reasoning dialogue about why this wont work
21:37:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> that is my automatic response to this every time
21:38:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> if you eat less calories than you expend, you will lose weight
21:38:12 <the_tasteful_nerd> this is a tool to let you know you are doing that
21:38:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> well i currently expend almost no calories which is part of why i would like to work out too
21:38:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
21:38:37 <the_tasteful_nerd> well you do, by breathing, and walkimg and stuff
21:38:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> theyre whol thing is to try and make logging food as quick and easy as possible so adherence is easy
21:38:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont do much of the latter
21:39:18 <the_tasteful_nerd> if u wanna set a goal just to drop some weight, macrofactor logging and trying to get a certain amount of steps per day (over whatever your avg is) will get you there
21:39:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> like if you look back and your phone says u avg like 4000 steps a day then try and get 6500 or 7000
21:39:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> and gradually increase that number
21:40:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> exercise is largely a drop in the bucket when it comes to energy expenditure
21:40:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol i hope you dont think that theres any chance that i avg 4000 steps a day
21:40:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dunno maybe not now
21:40:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> probably more like 400
21:40:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i am not exaggerating
21:40:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> but before when you had to go out more often
21:40:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah back then it was more
21:41:01 <the_tasteful_nerd> you could do like an actual "workout" and burn like 150 calories
21:41:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> or just, walk around more
21:41:08 <the_tasteful_nerd> move more
21:41:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> and that will largely have the same effect
21:41:31 <greatest_gamer> eating for weight loss is so much harder than working out now that i’ve worked out a lot and dieted a lot
21:41:50 <greatest_gamer> i wish i could just work it off that would be a delight
21:42:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah itd be nice if it worked that way
21:42:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> cardio's a scam unless you intentionally want to increase your cardio vascular capacity
21:42:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> i've been doing this cut for like 9 weeks eating ~500 calories under maintenance
21:42:43 <the_tasteful_nerd> and the only cardio i do is get 10k steps a day
21:42:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> and walk incline treadmill for like 30-40 min once a week
21:42:55 <greatest_gamer> the boxing has been tremendous for that i feel like my conditioning has improved a lot
21:43:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> and i'm down 12 lbs
21:43:26 <eric> I got a note in my change that I've never seen before 
21:43:28 <greatest_gamer> i’ve gone from 30s rounds to 1m to 90s all the way up to 3 minute rounds
21:43:33 <the_tasteful_nerd> nice
21:43:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> im thinkin about buying a sled now
21:43:43 <eric> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/u2VFtzZt/irccloudcapture3649867490285300207.jpg
21:43:47 <greatest_gamer> and when he does a combo where i have to duck, if i don’t really duck or like half ass it, he Will
21:43:47 <eric> Portrait mode
21:43:49 <greatest_gamer> hit me
21:43:56 <greatest_gamer> he’s throwing the pad at my head Hars
21:44:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> it is asking me to select my current estimated body fat range and i genuinely have 0 clue
21:44:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> probably 20-30%
21:44:30 <greatest_gamer> and doing that squat in the middle of boxing is so hard sometimes but it’s like well i don’t really want to get hit either
21:44:35 <greatest_gamer> good motivator
21:44:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol yeah
21:45:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> ur halfway to those weird eastern europeans dthat do like squats and have someone hit them in the gut when they come back up
21:45:37 <greatest_gamer> hahahaha
21:45:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk what i should select for 'the type of training i plan to do during this program, if any'
21:46:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> can i change this later
21:46:03 <greatest_gamer> none
21:46:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> yes
21:46:11 <the_tasteful_nerd> you can create a new goal at any time so dont worry about it
21:46:14 <the_tasteful_nerd> just put like sedentary
21:46:24 <Nude_Riker> sedento
21:46:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> ok im doing sedentary for now because we dont have a bike yet and i dont have any plan about doing weights
21:46:39 <this_fellow_kermit> hudge
21:46:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> all of this stuff is just initial setup for the algorithm and from here on out it solely uses your food intake and weight as data points
21:46:54 <greatest_gamer> most people are in that category even id they work out a bit
21:47:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> so in like 2 weeks it wont matter what you picked anyway
21:47:47 <greatest_gamer> my dad asked me to talk to my brother about working out lol
21:47:51 <greatest_gamer> how the tables have turned
21:47:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> i had to guess my weight and guess my body fat % so i have no idea if the initial goals are skewed because of that
21:48:03 <this_fellow_kermit> ass fat
21:48:27 <greatest_gamer> i’m gonna bully the shit out of my brother and be like i’ve been waiting 35 years for this you doughy bitch
21:48:30 <the_tasteful_nerd> it doesnt matter too much
21:48:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> but you do need a scale lol
21:48:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> so you can weigh
21:48:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> how does this crap work for adding food to the food log
21:49:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> whatevfer my phone is about to die and i need to do some work
21:49:08 <greatest_gamer> you mush em all together
21:49:16 <greatest_gamer> it’s hard if you’re using dry foods
21:49:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> .
21:49:45 <greatest_gamer> i didn’t want to eat all my food mushed into a log either dude but look at me now
21:50:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
21:50:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> i just dont understand how the damn app works
21:50:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> its pretty intuitive they have a knowledge base
21:50:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> its funny that it takes you through like 300 questions to figure out your goals and whatever but then it doesnt actualyl give you any kind of tutorial for how to use the app
21:50:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> i gotta go get ollie
21:50:57 <greatest_gamer> gotta catch some air
21:51:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> anyway i set my weight goal at 170. would be nice to get there
21:51:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive not been 170 in a very very long time
21:52:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> theres a food log button at the bottom
21:52:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> when i was like 21-22 i was 140 and then shot pretty much directly to 190-200 and have been around there ever since
21:52:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> https://help.macrofactorapp.com/
21:52:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive got to do some work ill play around with it later
21:53:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> im just eating more of the same leftovers i had this morning tonight so i guess once i have them built in as a recipe i can put that in for what i had earlier
21:54:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> yup
21:54:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> the more you use it the quicker it is to log

22:52:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> yes it does
22:52:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> but i want to do it now just to be a fuckin freak
22:52:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i only like pressies anyway, straight mdma broke my brain and i never want to touch it again
22:53:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> i almost drowned on straight mdma after being up for 48 hours binging on RC stims
22:53:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> that was funny
22:53:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> tbh it would probably be fun if you only did a little
22:53:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl omg
22:54:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> i was floating down a creek in an inner tube and i was caught in an eddy where the creak branched off to the long island sound and i was too fucked up to realize i could easily just walk myself onto the sand instead of trying to fight the current
22:54:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the only time i did mdma i was laying in my friend's bed crying for 4 hours straight and it permanently altered my brain
22:54:23 <bonegar> idk what mdma does tbh
22:54:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i had a multi-year severe depressive episode
22:54:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol oh my god
22:54:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> i was paddling a hard as i could in this innertube and wearing myself out almost falling through it and underneath the water and all my friends were shouting JUST WALK ON SHORE and i couldnt hear them over my idiots paddling
22:54:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm glad you didn't drown
22:54:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
22:55:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i just want like... a little mdma mixed with some meth
22:55:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's cool
22:55:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> what was going through my head at that time was 'boy are my parents going to be confused when they read this tox report'
22:55:36 <bonegar> lol
22:55:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
22:55:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats basically what i was on
22:55:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> nice dude
22:56:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> anyway i eventually did hear someone telling me to walk onto the shore and then i turned 90 degrees and easily walked onto the shore with the inner tube
22:56:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
22:56:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hell yeah
22:56:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> later that same day i went to work at 7-eleven after still continuously ripping my 4-MEC all day and i went into the bathroom and sneezed blood all over the mirror
22:57:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> at that point i realized 'ok... no more of this ever then'
22:57:26 <NORG> lol

23:54:52 <the_tasteful_nerd> u dont have to stand for this shit
23:54:54 <eric> its a course ive already paid for
23:56:20 <eric> the classes are still somewhat helpful but its mostly just because i get to talk with the other students a bit and she like correct us and stuff 
23:57:13 <dreddybajs> im back at it again streamin elden ring in discord
23:57:31 <eric> but there is no structure to the course at all and we do pretty much the same thing every week
23:57:56 <eric> like i feel like she comes up with the homework in the last 5 minutes of class
23:58:34 <eric> and shell get an idea to teach us something specific in the last half of the class but we have no idea its coming so shell ask us questions that nobody is prepared to answer
23:58:41 <eric> very bizarre
23:58:47 <dreddybajs> sounds like a bad teacher alright
23:59:03 <dreddybajs> is there anyone you can contact about the course not being satisfactory apart from her
23:59:20 <eric> we do an evaluation at the end which i will be honest in
23:59:52 <bonegar> how many other people are in your class
