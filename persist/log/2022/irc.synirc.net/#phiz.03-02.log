00:00:00 <bonegar> gathering enough cult seed money to reboot blade II and make it better
00:00:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
00:00:14 <bonegar> i really think i could make a better blade 2
00:00:19 <scoop_jackson> Were the blade comics good
00:00:25 <alansmithee_> they already doing a new blade
00:00:29 <bonegar> i dunno but i think i understand blade more than the comics
00:00:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they got mahershala ali to play blade in the reboot which is honestly a respectable choice
00:00:33 <alansmithee_> also some of them were fine
00:00:36 <bonegar> they need to hire me
00:00:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and wesley snipes is happy with that
00:00:44 <registered_mirc> Hire Fans
00:00:44 <bonegar> the blade understanderer
00:00:50 <alansmithee_> i doubt they'll do rated r tho 
00:00:58 <alansmithee_> which i think the original was
00:00:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but bonegar i would support you if you brought wesley snipes back
00:01:06 <bonegar> the world is full of vampires, now more than ever, and I need blade to kill them
00:01:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ^
00:01:13 <alansmithee_> i read a few of the original blade comics from different eras they were ok
00:01:18 <registered_mirc> the world IS a vampire
00:01:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> watch the blade anime
00:01:20 <scoop_jackson> What really matters is the soundtrack
00:01:22 <dreddybajs> what if it were Balde and it starred me
00:01:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my friend remixed the soundtrack and it's cool
00:01:36 <bonegar> i want to see blade kill a rich businessman in a cool way
00:01:45 <registered_mirc> with a sword
00:01:59 <bonegar> and then you find out the businessman was an evil vampire which is obvious, but also a regular vampire, which is also obvious
00:02:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://kilbourne.bandcamp.com/album/bloodrave-music-from-blade
00:02:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> for osme reason it's only showing the first track but they're all in there if you scroll down
00:02:47 <bonegar> blade 1 and 2 were uniquely obsessed with evil irish guys
00:03:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i guess it's a rescore not a remix but the blade songs are in there
00:03:10 <registered_mirc> they had cool names like Deacon Frost
00:03:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's funny whe nthey say deacon frost in the anime
00:03:26 <registered_mirc> sounds alike a dark souls name
00:03:32 <bonegar> definitely does
00:03:34 <bonegar> deacons of the deep
00:03:48 <registered_mirc> deacon frost the ice vampire
00:03:53 <scoop_jackson> this is cool
00:04:03 <dreddybajs> is anyone else noticing in the elden ring ost during eerie moments theres this super high pitched dissonant interval
00:04:10 <dreddybajs> it drives me insane its so offputting
00:04:10 <registered_mirc> yes
00:04:18 <dreddybajs> like its cool
00:04:20 <dreddybajs> but yea
00:04:27 <registered_mirc> that means its working

00:05:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> birds get old as hell

00:05:45 <William_Hootkins> The State of the Biden Presidency Is Strong
00:05:45 <William_Hootkins> Ignore his lousy approval numbers. Biden is handling the Ukraine crisis with astonishing skill.
00:05:47 <registered_mirc> i had a cockateil named alfy for a few years but i think it died
00:05:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think cockatoos also live a long time
00:05:51 <William_Hootkins> oh yeah?
00:05:57 <alansmithee_> i think some birds live long. like parrots and shit
00:06:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> cockatiels have fairly short lifespans
00:06:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my mom's bird is probably like 10
00:06:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i tihnk mason has mentioned her 
00:06:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> her name is Janice
00:06:25 <bonegar> i wanted to get a bird for a long time
00:06:50 <alansmithee_> there's a cockatoo that lived 83 years at a zoo
00:06:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> birds are cool as hell but my cats would eat whatever bird i get
00:07:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao gotcha is having so much fun with the paper
00:07:07 <alansmithee_> near chicago apparently
00:07:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> birds are cool because you can teach them swears
00:07:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my mom's bird yells dammit all the time
00:07:33 <alansmithee_> ravens have lived over 60 years
00:07:35 <bonegar> lol
00:07:36 <William_Hootkins> i had a lovebird for a long time
00:07:38 <William_Hootkins> named mango
00:07:45 <alansmithee_> apparently they don't show signs of aging either so fuck birds :(
00:07:54 <William_Hootkins> she lived to be like 15 or something
00:07:54 <alansmithee_> fakeass wannabe dinosaurs

00:12:08 <Nude_Riker> i liked pittsburgh the one time i went there for work

03:13:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oic
03:14:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> i was relatively popular on twitter in like 2012 when 3000 followers was a lot of followers to have
03:14:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> i still have that number now and now that isnt a lot
03:16:53 <bonegar> like 1 out of 4 people can play elden ring lmao
03:17:04 <bonegar> these PUG summons are so bad soemtimes
03:17:10 <bonegar> just some guy who runs off and dies in 1 second
03:17:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's me
03:17:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> sounds like me too
03:17:26 <bonegar> lol nah
03:17:27 <bonegar> way worse
03:17:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> (i havent played it yet)
03:17:33 <bonegar> like probably kids

03:19:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> people should see this and understand who the true victims of the war are
03:23:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i love when hockey guys throw themselves onto the ice to block pucks
03:23:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's very funny and dramatic
03:27:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> dan girardi used to be really good at that
03:27:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> so good that i got a jersey with his name on it
03:27:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol hell yeah
03:27:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> erik johnson does it a lot
03:27:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> our manlet samuel girard did it right before i sent that message
03:28:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's funny seeing him do it because he's so small compared to everyone else
03:28:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> remember when erik johnson missed an entire season because he ran himself over with a golf cart
03:29:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
03:40:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's actually stupider, he was getting out of the golf cart before it was totally stopped and his foot got stuck in between the pedals and he tore some ligaments
03:40:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this picture is so funny https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/dmDqbMrm/image.png
03:40:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he got hot though
03:41:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> in this pic he looks like he could be mouth mcfadden's brother
03:43:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
03:44:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> good teeth https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/R5QvGlhU/image.png
03:47:08 <William_Hootkins> matewan extremely good film
03:47:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> his wife hates that he won't wear his fake teeth
03:47:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/_piccone/status/1498857305043255296
03:47:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> she says she finds them in weird places around the house
03:48:51 <pubeman77> remember when he tore his knee up horsing around drunk on a golf cart
03:49:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah that's what we're talking about rofl
03:49:06 <pubeman77> somewhat of a bust
03:49:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm glad we have him
03:49:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's great
03:49:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's a good team guy too
03:49:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> everyone loves him
03:49:40 <pubeman77> i was unhappy
03:49:52 <pubeman77> that our oly #1 pick in forever didn't do anything
03:49:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
03:50:07 <pubeman77> but i guess we got a couple good seasons from chris stewart and a number from shattenkirk
03:50:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> if it makes you feel better we currently have a #1 and #2 overall from back to back years who everyone expected to light the world on fire and they havent
03:50:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> also if it makes you feel better youve won a cup in the last 25 years
03:50:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if we don't win this year i'm killing myself
03:51:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> (we're not going to win this year)
03:51:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> id recommend you dont
03:51:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> putting my life on the line for a sports team
03:51:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we're goign to choke again sadly
03:52:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/GracchiSimp/status/1498713376737873920
03:52:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> you wont have to worry about it because people like this run the world
03:53:22 <ehn> lol
03:53:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's cool
03:54:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if we get nuked i would rather be hit and die immediately than live with the aftermath
03:55:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk man it might be cool to live in cormac mccarthys classic novel "the road" for a little while
03:55:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> id give it a shot. coudl always just kill myself if it doesnt rule
03:56:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i need things to be a certain way and a post-apocalyptic environment is like the exact opposite of all of that
03:57:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think that i need things to be a certain way but ive also never tried shooting my way into the abandoned supermarket to get the last remaining spaghettios
03:57:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> who knows i might like it
03:57:57 <eric> I made good dinner then. Ate ice cream
03:58:05 <bonegar> the road

04:07:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what ice cream flavor
04:07:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> goodnight tom
04:16:06 <pubeman77> tom lmao @ that wheel clip
04:17:23 <eric> 1 scoop vanilla 1 scoop cherry Garcia 
04:17:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> makes sense
04:20:45 <pubeman77> that sounds good
04:21:34 <bonegar> you got multiple ice creams in your own home
04:25:35 <het> tbh I was just thinking about maybe making another ice cream
04:25:36 <het> maybe tomorrow
04:26:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/JBTNjeHJ/image.png

04:26:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i would have been so mad if the avs got a no goal call on this
04:29:18 <pubeman77> lmao one of my friends boyfriend is working a tool show
04:29:30 <pubeman77> "stagehanding the Tool concert tonight and he said they forced them to turn away and not look at the band as they came off stage"
04:47:48 <ehn> looks goalish
04:50:20 <pubeman77> thats not a goal if that's the best frame they have
04:50:28 <pubeman77> but it would make me mad
04:52:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ya

05:14:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what was it
05:17:18 <pubeman77> should i get pillars of eternity
05:17:20 <pubeman77> 2
05:17:29 <pubeman77> or the first pathfinder
05:18:07 <het> shrimp1989dspinfo: oh he made a joke CD podcast where he voiced two guys talking about how great the dark knight is but how it would benefit from a hard R, and then had a segment with og oggilby talking about buster keaton or some shit
05:18:18 <pubeman77> lol
05:18:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
05:18:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we need more hard Rs in cinema
05:19:16 <bonegar> i liked pillars of eternity
05:19:21 <bonegar> pathfinder idk
05:19:46 <pubeman77> going michael richards mode
05:20:21 <het> https://twitter.com/Psyche1226/status/1498733684165333000
05:20:25 <ajj2> pathfinder is more complicated and more like a straight version of playing the tabletop game 
05:20:32 <ajj2> its got some extra kingdom management stuff too 
05:21:57 <scoop_jackson> 0
05:22:12 <bonegar> i need to find a guy who sells sorceries
05:23:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's in the castle
05:23:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> stormveil
05:23:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> after the birds there's a church
05:23:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's in the church
05:23:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i hope i'm remembering this correctly. i marked him on my map
05:23:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> pretty sure he's a sorc
05:24:00 <ajj2> yah he sells sorc weapon arts 
05:24:20 <ajj2> theres also a lady in the the waypoint ruins next to the right side of the limgrave lake
05:24:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i need more faith spells
05:24:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> something stronger than the fireball
05:24:45 <ajj2> same 
05:24:57 <bonegar> me too
05:24:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the fireball is ftw but i'm not doing enough damage
05:25:32 <ajj2> i know theres prayer books you can turn in but im having a hard time finding them
05:26:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i want to find cool armor too
05:26:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm wearing knight clothes and i don't like them
05:26:25 <ajj2> its bonkers how hard armor is to find in this
05:26:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> bonegar's outfit is cool
05:26:33 <ajj2> i think ive fond like 1 chestpiece and thats it
05:26:44 <ajj2> and its worse than the one i have
05:26:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've found lots of stuff but it's mostly worse than ym starting clothes
05:26:59 <ajj2> yeah
05:27:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> only reason i wore the knight clothes is because i needed slightly better defense against margit
05:27:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> tomorrow i will finish the castle
05:27:30 <ajj2> niceee
05:27:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've been running around the last couple days runefarming and exploring
05:27:50 <ajj2> the castle is so fuckin cool 
05:27:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm level 35 or 36 now
05:27:53 <bonegar> i finally grinded up my int/faith enough and end enough and i can actually start leveling up
05:28:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my stats are all balanced
05:28:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> except the last one
05:28:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and it is 9
05:28:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i don't remember what iti s
05:28:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> arcane?
05:28:43 <bonegar> yea
05:28:45 <bonegar> arcane
05:28:52 <bonegar> seems like there might be some spells that require the stat
05:29:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> seeing a lot of glintstone spellcasters in the area i was exploring earlier
05:29:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like how they look
05:29:58 <bonegar> i just got one of their big hats
05:30:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hell yeah
05:30:14 <ajj2> ftmfw
05:33:41 <bonegar> glintstone arc is really good
05:41:56 <bonegar> just found a cool katana
05:42:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what is it
05:42:44 <bonegar> meteoric ore blade
05:42:52 <bonegar> requires str 15, dex 14, int 18
05:42:56 <bonegar> guess im getting my int to 18
05:43:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i found the uchigatana and have switched to that

13:29:59 <William_Hootkins> peak performance incoming
13:31:02 <Nude_Riker> today i need to do review meetings with my help desk Team, not looking forward to it but i will just say "ok i need to put something you did thats not in your listed duties so we can bump up your score"
13:31:04 <William_Hootkins> that shitty wawa breakfast hoagie was incredibly satisfying
13:31:19 <Nude_Riker> nice
13:31:33 <Nude_Riker> i got up and immediately took a few bites directly off the rotisserie chicken
13:32:12 <William_Hootkins> cutting really makes you appreciate the shittier things in life

14:37:56 <William_Hootkins> we love crymebot
14:41:43 <William_Hootkins> lol the whole reason i stood this bot up in the first place was to try and build a replacement for the weather function
14:42:00 <William_Hootkins> but like every api sucks in some way
14:42:30 <William_Hootkins> accuweather you only get 50 calls a day
14:42:45 <William_Hootkins> open weather you have to pass it your latitude and longitude
14:42:52 <William_Hootkins> darksky is gone
14:54:02 <William_Hootkins> hmm maybe i will try this weather2020 service it supports zipcode lookup
14:58:24 <greatest_gamer> it’s not 2020 dood
15:00:08 <William_Hootkins> maybe it will still work
15:00:21 <William_Hootkins> it would be funny if it just gave you the weather for the current day, but in 2020
15:00:26 <William_Hootkins> totally useless
15:02:56 <William_Hootkins> never mind its a timed trial period
15:02:57 <William_Hootkins> fuck you
15:03:33 <scoop_jackson> my friends older bro was one of the darkskys guy i should get the skinny on why he left
15:06:22 <William_Hootkins> probably because apple bought them no
15:07:10 <scoop_jackson> naw this was way before that
15:08:20 <scoop_jackson> Credit Suisse asks investors to destroy documents linked to oligarch and tycoon yacht loans
15:08:21 <scoop_jackson> lol
15:09:10 <William_Hootkins> ugh this has the same issue as openweather
15:09:16 <William_Hootkins> needs location specified in lat/lon
15:09:27 <greatest_gamer> registered_mirc: i was scrounging in some ancient ruins and came across this glyph. i made a rubbing and was hoping u could help interpret.
15:09:32 <William_Hootkins> so i'd have to have a seperate lookup on zip code to match lat/lon i guess
15:09:38 <greatest_gamer> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/EBoReP31/1646233770.JPG
15:09:42 <William_Hootkins> lmao mason
15:10:09 <William_Hootkins> i guess google maps api could probably return lat/lon by zip
15:10:54 <William_Hootkins> this is all way more work than making people type shit into wolfram alpha though
15:10:59 <William_Hootkins> so i think i might leave it be
15:17:02 <bonegar> anyone else have vivid dreams about allah and converting to islam last night?
15:19:14 <greatest_gamer> what did allah look like?
15:19:35 <bonegar> idk he called me on my phone and asked to play elden ring w/ me
15:19:58 <bonegar> and i got really excited but i couldn't figure out how to convert to islam
15:22:51 <eric> Oh there's an NPC who gives you the item
15:23:19 <bonegar> classic NPC move
15:24:14 <Melber> gdi im on zoom court and have no idea when im gonna be called and i really have to piss
15:24:27 <scoop_jackson> i dreamed about calling some blatently non vegatarian things vegatarian and then tried to avoid getting called out about something
15:24:33 <scoop_jackson> *about that
15:24:39 <bonegar> lol
15:25:38 <Nude_Riker> scheduled a video appointment for weird sinus stuff because the next in person one for my primary care doc was 4/20, wonder if this will get cancelled or be someone different
15:25:38 <Nude_Riker> , or be a waste of time where they say "you should come in"
15:25:52 <bonegar> sounds about right
15:26:27 <bonegar> telehealth is cool because it's just doctors going 'stop calling me'
15:28:10 <William_Hootkins> my one ailment cant be handled by telehealth so im hoping it just goes away in the next month or so
15:28:37 <bonegar> the system works
15:28:59 <Nude_Riker> it seems likely they will say they need to see me in person to do the "feel the lymph nodes, look in the ear, listen to the chest" routine
15:29:50 <Nude_Riker> i'll just pay the copay for them to tell me that though because maybe theyll tell me a secret way to do that faster
15:30:18 <bonegar> i had one of those scheduled in january and they rescheduled it two times, then stopped responding and eventually i just gave up 
15:30:31 <William_Hootkins> yeah maybe
15:30:34 <William_Hootkins> i just have an injury
15:30:48 <William_Hootkins> and i know any doctor will just say "stop working out"
15:30:52 <William_Hootkins> which is incorrect
15:31:09 <William_Hootkins> well, maybe correct but suboptimal
15:31:16 <Nude_Riker> lol
15:31:31 <William_Hootkins> if i still have lingering issues w/ it in a month i'll go to a physical therapist
15:31:54 <William_Hootkins> i think i have it figured out w/ these bfr bands though
15:32:30 <William_Hootkins> pretty wild being sore as hell from doing 15lb db presses and 30lb db bench presses
15:33:18 <bonegar> i'm pretty convinced i'd injure myself if i did weight training alone, eventhough it's probably superior and more efficient than just doing some body weight stuff 
15:34:14 <Nude_Riker> yeah i assume i would do a lot of damage to my body
15:37:09 -!- Rusty [uid73303@synIRC-350B032A.hampstead.irccloud.com] has joined #phiz
15:37:10 <William_Hootkins> incorrect
15:37:36 <William_Hootkins> its one of the safest forms of exercise, as long as you are not a total psycho and try to use way more weight than you know you can handle right off the bat
15:38:00 <Rusty>  Rusty joined  •  Channel mode: +snr  
15:38:00 <Rusty> 10:37 AM <William_Hootkins> incorrect
15:38:00 <Rusty> bitch you joined an irc channel. AND I DON'T LIKE IT
15:38:07 <William_Hootkins> lol
15:38:22 <William_Hootkins> bodyweight resistance training is great too but progressing is a bit more complex over time
15:38:39 <William_Hootkins> you have to track more variables
15:39:42 <Rusty> what's the bot thing for youtube, is it !y or !yt or !youtube
15:39:46 <Rusty> or is there not one currently
15:39:57 <William_Hootkins> .y
15:40:03 <William_Hootkins> i changed the trigger to .
15:40:11 <registered_mirc> lmao check out this self-importance https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/944021461004349501/948605109108109342/unknown.png

15:41:12 <William_Hootkins> yeah i was keeping it at ! in case phizbot ever returned so there wouldbt be a conflict
15:41:19 <William_Hootkins> but that might not happen so, here we are
15:41:24 <registered_mirc> i liked the !
15:41:28 <registered_mirc> more exciting
15:41:29 <William_Hootkins> its old school
15:41:32 <William_Hootkins> mirc era

15:41:52 <registered_mirc> i thinik it should stay ! but thats me
15:41:54 <William_Hootkins> :)
15:42:09 <William_Hootkins> i;m not sure if i can have multiples i never tried that and the documentation doesnt specify
15:42:52 <Rusty> .y qadir nickname
15:42:59 <Rusty> remembered this GTA4 banger today
15:52:01 <William_Hootkins> i never got very far in gta4
15:52:08 <William_Hootkins> thats the one i never finished
15:54:13 <bonegar> Niko is a war veteran from Eastern Europe, where he witnessed some of the worst atrocities humans are capable of, causing him to develop a very cynical view on life. After becoming involved with a Russian crime syndicate and discovering that his unit was sold out to enemy forces, he decides to move to Liberty City to pursue the American Dream, inspired by the tales of luxury and riches of his 
15:54:13 <bonegar> cousin Roman, who had been living there for the last decade. 
15:58:12 <dreddybajs> fuck yes radahn down
15:58:15 <dreddybajs> damn whata cool fight
15:59:33 <William_Hootkins> niko my cousin
16:01:53 <bonegar> i never really liked the 'humor' in the gta games. 
16:04:59 <scoop_jackson> !g which gta games did tim sweeney pick the songs for
16:05:10 <scoop_jackson> .g which gta games did tim sweeney pick the songs for
16:05:27 <William_Hootkins> ew
16:05:45 <William_Hootkins> some of it is fine but some of it has aged very poorly yes
16:08:10 <Nude_Riker> yeah the worst parts of GTA were the story
16:08:31 <eric> Will the next GTA be a period piece 
16:08:50 <bonegar> in the WILD WEST
16:08:58 <bonegar> and they'll call it... Red Dead Redemption 2
16:09:09 <bonegar> Mafia 2
16:09:19 <bonegar> Ubisoft vikings game asscreed 2
16:09:56 <Nude_Riker> i dont want to play them but i think that tweet saying fromsoft should do ass creed for souls games and make them based on world civs was right
16:09:57 <William_Hootkins> right said fred redemption 3
16:10:09 <Nude_Riker> malaysouls
16:10:17 <eric> Well I just mean that vice city was set in the 80s and San Andreas the 90s
16:10:20 <bonegar> what
16:10:24 <bonegar> i dont understand that sentence
16:10:30 <eric> I guess 4 and 5 have been contemporary 
16:10:39 <bonegar> whatever that tweet is saying sounds extremely wrong
16:10:41 <William_Hootkins> elden ring is sort of that except not based on world civs
16:10:45 <Nude_Riker> bonegar, https://twitter.com/oldking420/status/1498801990649974786
16:10:51 <bonegar> wrong
16:10:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> penisdick
16:10:56 <bonegar> big disagree from me
16:11:07 <bonegar> the last thing i want is weird nazi shit, just give me a big bird ghost
16:11:13 <eric> No
16:11:25 <eric> Make up something new please
16:11:26 <William_Hootkins> that is true if it was real cultures there would be less insane creatures
16:11:45 <bonegar> a take so bad i have to assume it's a troll
16:11:51 <Nude_Riker> well he's saying the mythology of those cultures
16:11:59 <Nude_Riker> so im sure theres lots of weird creatures
16:12:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have had very bad diarrhea since about 2 am
16:12:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> had to get out of bed like 4 times
16:12:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> this sucks
16:12:54 <Rusty> damn
16:12:59 <bonegar> i dont think from software would even be very good at that, and i don't really want ethnorealism in these games at all
16:13:01 <eric> Another bonus is that when it's just fantasy they get around some Japanese guy thinking geruda would be a good boss
16:13:09 <bonegar> it's clear they already borrow a ton anyway
16:13:36 <bonegar> from human history, like various helmets and weapons and stuff
16:13:50 <Rusty> how about some mods with harmful stereotypes/myths. Protocols of the Elden Ring of Zion
16:13:58 <bonegar> lol
16:14:13 <William_Hootkins> lol
16:14:17 <bonegar> the tarnished coming for your runecoins
16:14:17 <Rusty> weirdly racist Mario rom hacks walked so racist souls mods could run
16:14:39 <William_Hootkins> damn tom is having Arby's Revenge
16:15:20 <Nude_Riker> beefer's curse
16:15:25 <bonegar> anyway, fromsoft clearly takes inspiration from a ton of real world mythology stuff, as well as real human history... so that tweet is just a very dumb guy not understanding that and obsessing over nationalism 
16:15:39 <Nude_Riker> i think actually he was mostly making a joke
16:15:50 <bonegar> yea, he made himself one
16:16:19 <eric> It would be cool if there were more good games in the world about various sibjects
16:16:20 <bonegar> i can say absolutely moronic things too, it's very easy
16:16:37 <eric> But from soft doesn't need to make them all
16:16:52 <William_Hootkins> check this out
16:16:54 <William_Hootkins> grumsoft
16:17:05 <Nude_Riker> check this out: scrumsoft (everyone booing)
16:17:14 <William_Hootkins> i made you a game https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/6plqcWiY/image.png
16:17:30 <Nude_Riker> but you eated it?
16:17:37 <eric> Star trek épisode of a planet of gamers and Riker must compete to save the enterprise 
16:17:55 <ajj2> lol
16:17:59 <eric> Maybe Jordi instead
16:20:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> what ig he was jortsi and he wore jorts
16:20:51 <Nude_Riker> !gis geordi in jorts
16:21:12 <bonegar> it's kinda sad that there will never be a new tng, until machine learning can create models of all the actors from previous episodes to generate new movements 
16:21:19 <eric> .gis levar burton in shorts
16:21:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> one of phil's big stream guys i guess stopped giving him money and gave an interview to some kiwifarms guys and reading about all this is giving me a headache
16:21:39 <William_Hootkins> lol
16:21:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't understand any of these people
16:21:46 <bonegar> i wonder what it'd be like to get into like ... 80s/90s tng paperback fiction
16:21:53 <William_Hootkins> epic basement haul here https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/IKGyEHyi/IMG_3910.JPG
16:21:57 <eric> treasure
16:22:04 <Rusty> nice
16:22:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
16:22:07 <bonegar> shrimp, i think the hate-watching twists them into monsters
16:22:07 <Nude_Riker> oof
16:22:16 <William_Hootkins> lord knows how old this shit is
16:22:18 <eric> yes there is darkness in their hearts
16:22:21 <NORG> [10:17] <William_Hootkins> i made you a game https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/6plqcWiY/image.png
16:22:23 <NORG> oh boy what flavor
16:22:33 <William_Hootkins> cant even imagine what i would have gotten the banana shit for
16:22:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> NORG onlyicedcoffee is a new detractor
16:22:43 <bonegar> lol
16:22:45 <eric> having fun with jamaican rum
16:23:05 <bonegar> pour it all into a jug, take 1 gulp and puke
16:23:09 <NORG> i think oic is a detractor to the detractors
16:23:22 <NORG> a new european donating 150 dollars a day (organically) will appear out of nowhere
16:23:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he did an interview with detractor youtubers
16:23:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
16:23:28 <eric> in fact phil is the fel portal that allows evil to enter the realms of man
16:23:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm not going to listen to this shit
16:23:39 <NORG> me neither
16:23:47 <bonegar> i could imagine like a banana schnapps khalua drink maybe
16:24:04 <Rusty> banana schnapps + foster's. banana fosters
16:24:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's so insane to me that there are like 5 big detractor youtubers who get thousands more views during their streams than phil does
16:24:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> not collectively but each one
16:24:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> detractors have their favorite king detractors
16:24:27 <bonegar> phil definitely is a manifestation of successful negative energy
16:24:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah bonegar he is
16:24:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> im really hungry because of the complete evacuation of my guts
16:25:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> but im also not confident that i can successfully eat food at this time
16:25:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> arby
16:25:18 <eric> a spot of dried toast perchance
16:25:22 <NORG> Im gonna door dash some chik fila soon
16:25:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> arby would not be the move at this time i think
16:25:30 <bonegar> what happened to your guts?
16:25:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk my dinner last night made me sick i guess because i was up pretty much all night having diarrhea
16:25:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> replace the old arby with new arby
16:26:09 <bonegar> i feel that. i was doing all kinds of barfing yesterday. 
16:26:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> why is everyone ill
16:26:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> be well
16:26:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> sydney made massaman curry w/ tofu and i guess something in it made me sick. we have made the massaman curry with beef several times and ive never had a problem
16:26:41 <bonegar> im blaming the weather and ground beef for my barfing yesterday, but mostly the weather
16:26:56 <NORG> browned geef
16:27:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> negative energies in the atmosphere manifesting as illnesses
16:27:43 <bonegar> well, it went from feezing to summer overnight 
16:28:01 <bonegar> just weird to breathe in hot heavy humid air in march 1
16:28:02 <eric> hard to stomach the realities of climate change
16:28:16 <bonegar> you know like when you get altitude sickness
16:28:40 <William_Hootkins> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/XFq7UIVG/image.png

16:30:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> we must distribute suffering evenly throughout the world
16:31:08 <William_Hootkins> this is suffering that didn't need to happen
16:31:10 <scoop_jackson> cocaine energy?
16:31:12 <William_Hootkins> so i shant be partaking
16:31:21 <eric> its fake cocaine energy even worse
16:31:25 <scoop_jackson> ^
16:31:30 <bonegar> that video is just what it feels like to be around other people to me
16:31:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive never met someone on cocaine as annoying as this
16:32:00 <eric> its like growing up watching tv presenters who are actually on cocaine
16:32:08 <eric> and modeling your thing after that
16:32:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> the cake does sound good though.
16:32:34 <bonegar> i think a lot of zoomers are just really shouty because they grew up watching youtuber videos and have youtube presenter energy
16:32:54 <eric> yeah honestly one of the most annoying things about this to me is that he suggests the recipe is weird
16:33:02 <eric> fuck off pal theres a million ways to bake a damn cake
16:34:13 <het> I lasted even less time into that video than I did the gerblin
16:34:14 <bonegar> i just watched it again
16:34:27 <NORG> i watched the video
16:34:37 <bonegar> this is like.. idk, this is how people behave lmao
16:34:37 <NORG> he's cool
16:34:57 <NORG> who's gerblin
16:35:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> most people do not behave like this
16:35:09 <bonegar> maybe not where you live
16:35:15 <eric> .g gerblin tiktok lady
16:35:33 <eric> that was actually it
16:35:39 <bonegar> 'zany'
16:36:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i shan't be clicking play on any of those
16:36:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the thumbnails are nough
16:36:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> enough

16:36:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> theres the gerblin video norg
16:37:31 <eric> ive never seen this youtube interface before
16:37:47 <bonegar> there are a lot of like.. very standard 'nerds' out here, like the kind of people who stick star wars stickers on the back of their cars, but think they're being tasteful because it's only black and white.. and they all kinda do some variant of that zany-nerd schtick

16:43:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> thanks neogaf for the posters i'm going to buy
16:43:25 <bonegar> lol i've absolutely seen posters of this in people's houses
16:43:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> one of the friends in this couple is the one who is always posting stupid bullcrap from these dumbass podcasts about boooks that she listens to about how "these are the types of books you should read this year. 1. a childrens book by a native american 2. a young adult novel by a disabled person
16:43:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> vault boy posters
16:43:43 <eric> lol
16:44:02 <bonegar> that was half my bookclub
16:44:10 <bonegar> it was rough lmao. thankfully we dissolved finally
16:44:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm gonna start a book club where we just read every pretty little liars book
16:44:54 <bonegar> lmao
16:44:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/B50VB7mF/Screen%20Shot%202022-03-02%20at%2011.44.41%20AM.png
16:45:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> this neogaf thread rules
16:45:16 <bonegar> lmao
16:45:24 <bonegar> this is how normal people live
16:45:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm thinking of the photos of phil's house after leanna left when he put up the video game art that she didn't want him to hang
16:45:32 <eric> it dissolved after bonegar suggested the first volume of knausgaard
16:45:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
16:45:47 <bonegar> lol

16:45:50 <scoop_jackson> when i was a freshman in college i went to the nerd club and never went again b/c of the atmosphere
16:45:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> why do these assholes get to own houses and i have to rent
16:45:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
16:45:56 <eric> what was it shrimp
16:46:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> my strubgle by jomny sun
16:46:02 <Rusty> i made these for myself & some close HS friends a few years ago, i think it’s the one videogame thing i have hanging up https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/FrK3APeK/IMG_9569.JPG
16:46:13 <eric> oh was it like a bunch of stuff
16:46:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah
16:46:21 <eric> thats cool rusty
16:46:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i can go through his insty and find it
16:46:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ddr ftw
16:46:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have cat stuff all over my walls
16:46:41 <bonegar> my college anime club watched dubbed anime, that was a big enough redflag for me to never get involved. also i would have never admitted to watching anime in college.
16:46:48 <Rusty> all the engravings had our shit-ass xanga names on them
16:46:54 <Rusty> lol bonegar
16:46:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> shrimp1989dspinfo: because the sort of life that a person leads where a person comes to believe that this is 'tasteful art' is congruous with the sort of life that a person leads where they Are Rich
16:47:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> someone described my house as a grandmother and her weird nerd grandson living together
16:47:22 <scoop_jackson> lol i took like a japanese history class to fulfull the distributional requirements and the prof asked us the first day if any of us watched anime and two ppl raised their hands
16:47:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i just buy crap from flea markets and thrift storesto put up
16:47:37 <eric> trap sprung
16:47:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> instead of seeking out gaming posters or whatever
16:47:39 <Rusty> lol
16:47:49 <eric> lol
16:47:59 <scoop_jackson> (i am sure that there were at least 3 other ppl in the class including me that would watch anime sometimes)
16:48:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/o243iBmr/Screen%20Shot%202022-03-02%20at%2011.47.49%20AM.png
16:48:15 <eric> my vibe is thriftstore / crap ive gotten for free / junk ive had my entire life
16:48:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> steve would take his jp classes here sometimes when he was visiting and i would peek at the videos fo the other people and this one guy was like absolutely fully surrounded by gunpla and anime figgies
16:48:22 <bonegar> i mean, i do understand 'you are supposed to hang something on your walls. what do i hang on my walls? something I like? well i guess if i frame it, that makes it fancy. and it's styled in a way that might not upset my parents who still do not know who mario is'
16:48:27 <eric> basically a pile of moldering crap and i bury myself deep within
16:48:35 <bonegar> definitely very early 20s move

16:49:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> I'm a bit surprised that I haven't seen anything else by Zac Gorman here; I have a print of this one about the house:
16:49:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/UqZtYOaP/image.png
16:49:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> if i saw this in someones house i would leave
16:50:09 <bonegar> i would simply pretend not to know what it is
16:50:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> scrolling through phil's insty to try and find his wall art and my NEgative Emotions have been awakened by the fact that tihs man literally has a wife who loves him
16:50:23 <bonegar> which could make things better or worse, if they start explaining
16:50:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> even without knowing what it is, the artstyle and the text are bad enough
16:50:44 <eric> we have some real art but since were moving about so much ive not had the chance to really put it up

17:18:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> The nice thing about game artwork is that it can be as overt or subtle as you like. And certain mainstays like Mario are seen more as retro geek hipsterish nowadays. It's all a matter of your comfort zone. Gaming is an important hobby to me. I'm not so insecure in thinking that I can't
17:18:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> (that's the end of the post. it ends like that)

17:23:35 <registered_mirc> i just assume i am super fucked up lol
17:23:37 <registered_mirc> total goblin

17:24:00 <registered_mirc> god that comic book image is insane
17:24:01 <lavender_toni> goblin wife
17:24:09 <pubeman77> my tax returns were accepted
17:24:11 <pubeman77> vary naice
17:24:12 <bonegar> goblin wife
17:24:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i feel like i am very repellent
17:24:59 <lavender_toni> im not going to have a wife anytime soon
17:25:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm becoming the woman version of the dudes who get mad abotu other dudes having wives
17:26:00 <bonegar> i'm unintentionally infuriating to be around so i'm just gonna get thrown into a wall or a television. i already gave the whole relationship thing my best shot. so i'm free to do whatever i want and it rules 
17:26:03 <registered_mirc> youve been with anni for like many years tho
17:26:07 <registered_mirc> youre practically married
17:26:09 <lavender_toni> we broke up a while back
17:26:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmao
17:26:12 <registered_mirc> aw shit
17:26:13 <registered_mirc> sorry man
17:26:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/GegAJnes/image.png
17:26:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> you made ico Dark and Gritty
17:26:30 <lavender_toni> its fine it was for the best for everyone
17:26:58 <bonegar> alone ftw
17:27:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm not really sure what i do wrong but sometimes it has funny results
17:27:29 <lavender_toni> unfortunately im very bad at being single and practically dating the neofolk girl already
17:27:41 <registered_mirc> neofolk girl
17:27:41 <NORG> lol
17:27:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like an ex hated me so much he wrote me an email a decade ago that i still laugh about
17:27:50 <bonegar> i'm not sure there's really such a thing as right or wrong, but people will just extract whatever they can out of you then move on when they get bored
17:27:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and ended with "my art has no place in your loathsome hands"
17:27:59 <registered_mirc> lol
17:28:00 <registered_mirc> hahahaha
17:28:05 <registered_mirc> what the fuck
17:28:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when i received it i was in the car with mason
17:28:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i read the whole tihng outloud
17:28:17 <lavender_toni> damn thats good shrimp
17:28:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and we were just hollering laughing
17:28:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it took liek 30 minutes to get through
17:28:29 <bonegar> lol
17:28:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> this guy said "my wife bought me this, it's absolutely gorgeous in person" https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/w4CADebF/image.png
17:28:34 <registered_mirc> i've probably written some pretty cringe emails for exs but never anything like that
17:28:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've had a few dudes hate me intensely
17:28:54 <scoop_jackson> "my art has no place in your loathsome hands"
17:29:00 <the`shima> linking this cursed as fuck thing again https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un3TmvzoVYM
17:29:08 <the`shima> i still cant get my head around it
17:29:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but lately i've just had guyswho neglect me and then vanish for no real reason
17:29:22 <the`shima> my man being ghosted
17:29:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> i maintained good relations with all the people i dated (which was only 3 people)
17:29:35 <bonegar> i will ghost anyone so i will never get mad at being ghosted
17:29:40 <bonegar> it's all fair play to me
17:29:55 <registered_mirc> the last girl i was with assumed we were in an open relationship but neglected to tell me
17:30:00 <scoop_jackson> lol
17:30:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it hurts me very deeply because i don't really like getting close to people
17:30:02 <bonegar> lol
17:30:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> it rules the`shima 
17:30:13 -!- letty [~letty@synIRC-77688CA5.dyn.plus.net] has joined #phiz
17:30:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol registered_mirc 
17:30:15 <lavender_toni> im a friend to all men
17:30:16 <bonegar> shrimp neither do i, that's why i'm very comfortable with it
17:30:17 <registered_mirc> i found out because she brought her other guy to a party and i was like oh ok its like that
17:30:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> not in a relationship way
17:30:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> its because you give off poly vibes
17:30:25 <registered_mirc> i was Not Nice to her about it
17:30:27 <bonegar> someone ghosts me? it's very relieving 
17:30:28 <the`shima> i hang out with the last two dudes i was kinda seeing. we had big disagreement and fallings out but i reached out to them after a few months to put things right
17:30:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i would have flipped out
17:30:32 <bonegar> oh ok, cool. np.
17:30:35 <the`shima> that sucks
17:30:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> you gotta stop wearing a vest and porkpie hat everywhere
17:30:50 <registered_mirc> shrimp1989dspinfo: i will not repeat the things i said to her while drunk
17:30:51 <lavender_toni> lmao
17:30:51 <bonegar> lol
17:31:01 <registered_mirc> and tbh that was the catalyst for me quitting alcohol so maybe a blessing in disguise
17:31:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> steve was one of my only friends before we started dating so all of this shit still hurts really bad even though it's been like 3 months now
17:31:20 <lavender_toni> dman you dated matts cat? it all makes sense now
17:31:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> registered_mirc> shrimp1989dspinfo: i will not repeat the things i said to her while drunk
17:31:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
17:31:29 <scoop_jackson> 3 months isnt that long depending on hte relationship
17:31:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> did you apologize by singing the song my own worst enemy by lit
17:31:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ahahha
17:31:41 <registered_mirc> no
17:31:43 <registered_mirc> i dont know that song
17:31:44 <the`shima> i dont really have any opinion on open relationships and stuff from a totally personal point of view these days but i think forcing that on somebody is really really awful
17:31:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think you probably do whether or not you realize it
17:31:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> .y lit my own worst enemy
17:31:57 <scoop_jackson> just have clear communications
17:32:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't want to date someone who wants an open relationship
17:32:15 <registered_mirc> i dunno, do i project the air of someone who knows the band lit lol
17:32:19 <registered_mirc> i know they exist
17:32:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i know the band lit
17:32:24 <Nude_Riker> lmao epic games bought bandcamp
17:32:25 <registered_mirc> but and what they look like
17:32:27 <bonegar> open relationship is just being a friend
17:32:27 <Nude_Riker> RIP bandcamp
17:32:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah bonegar
17:32:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> a friend who plows
17:32:40 <registered_mirc> its really not but whatever
17:32:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it just seems like a complicated mess
17:32:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> you were around and probably like... hearing alternative rock radio at the time
17:33:02 <registered_mirc> it's stupid bullshit for people who are fence sitters
17:33:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they play my own worst enemy at ball arena so i get to hear that song all the time
17:33:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> well yeah mpg that as well
17:33:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> i actually had this cd and i also saw them live
17:33:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if you're afraid of commitment just be honest about it
17:33:46 <the`shima> ya tom i guess i do have an opinion i guess i mean im just cool with it. the last two relationships of sorts i've had were both based on an agreement that it was fine to be romantically intimate and fuck other people. i guess i just wouldt seek to ever be like THIS HAS TO BE CLOSED/THIS HAS TO BE OPEN
17:33:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> im tom
17:34:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i would probably murder someone in that scenario
17:34:02 <lavender_toni> im toni
17:34:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i would go absolutely batshit insane. no thank you
17:34:25 <registered_mirc> shrimp1989dspinfo: well the last one i was not ready for immediate commitment and made that clear because i wanted to let things just be as they were but evidently that wasn't enough for her
17:34:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> controversial opinion: monogamy is good
17:34:45 <registered_mirc> plus she cheated on her bf (who was my friend) with me, so i kinda didnt trust her either
17:34:46 <Nude_Riker> i think many things are good
17:34:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> monogamy is ftw
17:34:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> 12:33 PM <registered_mirc> it's stupid bullshit for people who are fence sitters
17:34:49 <registered_mirc> im a bad person
17:34:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> what about people who are flagpole sittas
17:35:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i was in that situation before and i felt bad aobut it for the entire relationship
17:35:24 <lavender_toni> i dont have a moral objection to open relationship but almost all cases ive seen of them have been for the wrong reasons
17:35:29 <registered_mirc> yeah
17:35:34 <Nude_Riker> the main thing i dont get about people who are in open or poly or w/e is where do they get all the energy
17:35:35 <registered_mirc> im not against it
17:35:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but his ex still wanted to be friends with me and she was like extremely grateful that i triggered their breakup
17:35:42 <lavender_toni> but two of my very good friends have been together for 10yrs and they were open for like 6-7 of that so i guess ti can work
17:35:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> becuase she hated being with him lmfao
17:35:47 <registered_mirc> but, you are not allowed to put me in an open relationship without telling me
17:35:48 <registered_mirc> lol
17:35:49 <bonegar> polycule stuff seems very bad, and i was only joking about friendship being 'open relationship' 
17:35:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> 12:34 PM <Nude_Riker> i think many things are good
17:35:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/clyTuym0/image.png
17:36:10 <registered_mirc> polycule stuff seems toxic as fuck to me
17:36:17 <the`shima> i think thats probably where i come at it from. i dont really think monogamy/polygamy matters that much, personally. i think how you love somebody does and i really dont vibe with a lot of peoples ideas of love - often very posessive, "i'd do anything for you" - and so on and that kind of fits more typically with monogamy
17:36:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Welcome To My Polycule
17:36:20 <bonegar> yea i dont buy it
17:36:22 <Nude_Riker> people do get weirdly jealous about platonic friendship stuff too though
17:36:36 <registered_mirc> yeah
17:36:41 <registered_mirc> i used to be one of those
17:36:41 <bonegar> yea
17:36:50 <Nude_Riker> "i thought we were best friends (monog)"
17:36:52 <registered_mirc> i might still be depending on the behavior
17:37:05 <registered_mirc> like if people are friends, whatever, but if they're friends and also very physical
17:37:06 <registered_mirc> not thanks
17:37:08 <lavender_toni> polyamigous friendship
17:37:09 <registered_mirc> no thanks
17:37:53 <bonegar> i suppose i got pretty angry at my oldest friend maintaining a relationship with my ex and lying to me about it for years, and found out they met up every thanksgiving and easter and was lying to me about it.. so it got too hard to talk to them anymore and i had to cut all ties with them
17:37:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm friends with dudes nad i know that can worry people so i'm jsut extremely open about my friendships and if i'm texting someone while hanging out wit hthe person i'm in a relationship with i kind of summarize the conversation to keep them from worrying
17:38:05 <the`shima> matt people fundamnentally dont understand what love is when it comes to relationships/friendships imo. people see things as possessive and transactional when imo if you love somebody you shoudl just want them to grow and become something better with or without you
17:38:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but that probably stems from an ex being extremely psycho about my friendships
17:38:13 <bonegar> sucks but like... just had no idea how to emotionally get through that. im sure they think im petty
17:38:23 <the`shima> i have been really bad for this before tho lol
17:38:23 <Nude_Riker> i lost two friends in the last couple of years because it turns out i was friendzoning them and they wanted to bone
17:38:34 <Nude_Riker> sorry i thought you actually wanted to be my friend
17:38:45 <bonegar> lol yea that sucks
17:39:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah when steve broke up with me he was like "you've done so much for me and helped me grow and i haven't given you anything" like bro it's not transactional i don't care
17:39:04 <registered_mirc> bonegar: well the lying thing sucks so
17:39:11 <registered_mirc> i dont think youre super out of line
17:39:18 <the`shima> lol yeah shrimp1989dspinfo
17:39:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i did all that stuff because i care 
17:39:24 <bonegar> no but like, people are just always going to do terrible things
17:39:29 <Nude_Riker> that reminds me i need to finish reading that bell hooks book
17:39:29 <bonegar> so you have to forgive them or whatever
17:39:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's also a really shitty reason to dump someone
17:39:40 <bonegar> so i could forgive them but i just didn't ever want to see them again
17:39:41 <Nude_Riker> which better fucking tell me how to love in the second half
17:39:55 <the`shima> i really hate hooking up fwiw  too
17:39:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it was just one of his reasons, the other being "our personalities don't match" but then why are we friends
17:40:01 <registered_mirc> yeah there are many many people who i just dont ever want to see or think about again
17:40:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> pathetic flimsy non-reasons
17:40:22 <registered_mirc> shrimp1989dspinfo: im very close with my old gf pam, we're bff now
17:40:26 <bonegar> also my ex did pretty terrible things, and this was my closest friend, and they were all like 'i can compartmentalize. we don't talk about you at ALL. well okay we talk about you some, but..'
17:40:29 <registered_mirc> but i would never date her again
17:40:29 <Nude_Riker> i am kind of scared of running into one of them when i go back to oregon, we were long time internet friends and she lives in portland now
17:40:30 <bonegar> it was jsut lie after lie after lie
17:40:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> hooking up sucks fuckin ass and i do not understand how anyone likes it
17:40:35 <bonegar> i assumed maybe they were fucking
17:40:36 <bonegar> dont care
17:40:42 <lavender_toni> you should bone matt
17:40:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont understand how anyone enjoys sex without emotional attachment
17:40:48 <Nude_Riker> absolutely not lavender_toni 
17:40:49 <registered_mirc> i like hooking up
17:40:55 <the`shima> i find it very hard to do anything unless im enjoying any kind of actual intimacy with the person but that does make some relationships with guys awful as the line between deep friendship/"romantic" gets blurry
17:41:03 <lavender_toni> why not
17:41:09 <registered_mirc> sometimes someone is just hot and you wanna bone and let that be the end of it
17:41:13 <the`shima> yeah tom. literally
17:41:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't know that feel mpg
17:41:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk registered_mirc that doesnt register for me
17:41:30 <bonegar> i think there are a lot of people who consider sex a 'biological need' and it has nothing to do with emotion
17:41:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i can't imagine sleeping with someone i'm not already invovled with
17:41:35 <registered_mirc> its fine im used to being in this position
17:41:36 <bonegar> and a lot of those people are out there on the dating apps
17:41:39 <the`shima> i'd rather just go masturbate in a toilet than have sex with somebody random i was chatting to in a bar all night about crap
17:41:39 <NORG> i tried hooking up w ppl after my last relatipnship epicaly failed
17:41:44 <Nude_Riker> because i do not find them attractive and they cut off contact after i said them telling me they were going to kill themselves because of me and disappearing for months made me need to step back when they resurfaced
17:41:51 <NORG> not for me
17:41:51 <registered_mirc> i dont believe i could make you understand either so its cool
17:41:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think youre wrong mpg i just do not feel it myself
17:41:58 <lavender_toni> thats a good reason
17:42:00 <registered_mirc> ive had quite a lot of fun tho
17:42:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> bonegar your ex sounds awful
17:42:05 <Nude_Riker> thank you toni
17:42:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> it is not a thing that i can do
17:42:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i looked at tinder once for 20 minutes and it made me feel extremely bad
17:42:21 <bonegar> i can barely talk about it
17:42:25 <Nude_Riker> i feel bad every time i look at tinder as well
17:42:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm sorry bonegar
17:42:30 <registered_mirc>  fwiw ive never had like a healthy mental outlook about sex so
17:42:36 <lavender_toni> i would like to enjoy sex without any kind of emotional attachment but i dont think im built for it
17:42:43 <registered_mirc> like i saw porn when i was super duper young and im pretty sure that skewed my outlook
17:42:44 <the`shima> i think in my life i've probably spent 16 minutes or something looking at grindr and i was immediately put off eveyr time lolo
17:42:45 <bonegar> nah it's fine
17:42:52 <NORG> Grindr ftw
17:42:59 <Nude_Riker> grindr seems better and much worse
17:43:01 <registered_mirc> my friend is a developer for grindr
17:43:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> if i have some sort of fantasy scenario of having sex with a person who i think is hot, it is coupled with the imagination of having an emotional attachment to that person also
17:43:03 <NORG> Hey bro? Whats up. Here's my cock.
17:43:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i just really want a loving caring relationship and sex comes with that in my brain
17:43:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i am also very reserved about that sort of thing and i can't imagine exposing myself like that to just anyone
17:43:20 <bonegar> it's my fault. i committed to relationship and was dumb enough to believe they loved me when they said they did because i wanted to... classic trick to believe things you want to hear
17:43:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> steve is my cat toni.
17:43:25 <NORG> Or if theyre a bottom: Hey bro? whats up. Heres my bent over in front of my mirror w/ mah harry ass cheeks spread wide
17:43:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> very terrible thought
17:43:29 <bonegar> i'll never fall for that one again. never want to hear.
17:43:32 <lavender_toni> what are matts boys called
17:43:32 <registered_mirc> shrimp1989dspinfo: being an alcoholic makes it a lot easier.
17:43:36 <lavender_toni> i thgought steve was one of them
17:43:38 <Nude_Riker> jackie chan and sammo hung
17:43:45 <lavender_toni> pretty close
17:43:48 <NORG> lol
17:43:49 <lavender_toni> steve chan
17:43:56 <registered_mirc> steve is will's cat
17:43:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've been an alcoholic!! the most i did was kiss people and then feel bad about it lmao
17:44:11 <registered_mirc> i dunno then
17:44:11 <the`shima> i think ideally id just like lots of deep intimate relationships with guys and if a bunch of them are sexual that is good lol. i dont want open in a "lets hook up with people/bring 3rd people into this/whatever"
17:44:32 <the`shima> but id be fine with monogamy too if thats how it went. who knows
17:44:32 <the_tasteful_nerd> alcoholism ftw
17:44:34 <NORG> the last time i hooked up w/ someone from tinder i got my wee wee sucked then they segued that into talking about being child trafficked. that was cool
17:44:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> for me sex w/o emotional attachment isnt really better than jacking off. and with jacking off i dont have to feel bad about it and wonder if i could have done something differently to foment an emotional attachment
17:44:44 <registered_mirc> alcoholism fuckin sucks please dont say its ftw
17:44:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> fortunately i dont have to worry about this anymore
17:44:48 <lavender_toni> i want normal boring monogamy with a relatively normal not boring woman
17:44:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> jacking off makes me feel bad so i simply don't do it
17:44:50 <bonegar> i can barely drink anymore it sucks
17:44:57 <bonegar> 1 beer and im over
17:44:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> i love my alcoholism 
17:45:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> agreed lavender_toni 
17:45:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah toni i want sometihng like taht
17:45:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i have that
17:45:16 <NORG> Give me monogaomy or give me breastts
17:45:20 <lavender_toni> lol
17:45:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> unfortunately i'm old and my chances of finding that are very slim
17:45:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> what about both, Norg
17:45:27 <lavender_toni> how old are you
17:45:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> you arent old
17:45:30 <the_tasteful_nerd> mammography
17:45:31 <lavender_toni> let me guess, 32
17:45:34 <the`shima> i agree tom. i also think jacking off is better than sex with no emotional attaachment cause at least you can have it linked to some fantasy element which is very hard if youre just fucking somebody for the sake of it lol
17:45:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
17:45:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah the`shima 
17:45:51 <NORG> jacking, wacking, cranking & spanking all kick so much ass
17:45:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'll be 32 this year but i like talking about being old and hitting the wall
17:45:54 <registered_mirc> yall making me feel pretty bad about my whole sitch
17:46:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> im sorry mpg
17:46:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've hit the wall! it's all over for me!
17:46:20 <the_tasteful_nerd> stfu u dont even have a child
17:46:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> mpg i'm sorry too, i didn't mean to make you feel bad
17:46:24 <lavender_toni> i feel like dating in your 30s should be simpler once you meet people who agree re: kids
17:46:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's just different outlooks i guess
17:46:29 <bonegar> there's definitely that feeling where you realize your peers in your dating pool are all jaded and have tons of baggage to work through
17:46:29 <NORG> nobodys judging mpg just different strokes for differnt folks
17:46:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think it's probably different for men and women too
17:46:41 <the`shima> ya nobody is judging anybody here
17:46:53 <lavender_toni> im judging djcozmik
17:46:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats not true the`shima im judging norg
17:46:54 <the`shima> also theres some Gay Shit in there which is obviously gonna be different
17:46:54 <registered_mirc> not judging but
17:46:59 <registered_mirc> i feel like an absolute freak now
17:47:01 <bonegar> i guess that's why you see older people start praying on people in their early 20s to date
17:47:06 <bonegar> preying
17:47:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> youre not a freak mpg
17:47:11 <NORG> Judge my nut's sack.
17:47:14 <registered_mirc> also im about to be 42 lol
17:47:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you're not, i know other people who are able to do that too
17:47:17 <registered_mirc> what is even left for me
17:47:24 <NORG> elden ring 2
17:47:28 <registered_mirc> yeah
17:47:31 <bonegar> hell, most of elden ring 1 still
17:47:33 <registered_mirc> that's the ring i wanna put on it
17:47:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dunno you got probably another 35 years to think about it probably
17:47:41 <registered_mirc> put an elden ring on it
17:47:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> fwiw registered_mirc probably the worst relationship tension that i had with sydney near the start of our relationship was that she had a similar outlook to hooking up as you do and i couldnt understand it
17:47:57 <the`shima> i wish the bot with quotes was in here so i could demonstate that im the real freak here
17:48:03 <NORG> quotes are back
17:48:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> it is in here.
17:48:04 <lavender_toni> youre just in the company of a bunch of weird nerds registered_mirc dont worry youre normal
17:48:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> so its not like that outlook is only for freaks or that you are the only person in the world who has it
17:48:08 <NORG> the floor is yours
17:48:10 <bonegar> .q 4
17:48:16 <the`shima> .q genesis
17:48:19 <registered_mirc> the`shima: let's not play the 1 up game
17:48:19 <the`shima> ffs
17:48:22 <lavender_toni> .q search genesis
17:48:22 <bonegar> no wordsearch yet
17:48:31 <NORG> v_v 
17:48:31 <bonegar> .q
17:48:34 <registered_mirc> i know precisely how many women ive slept with
17:48:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> oh. serch doesnt work.
17:48:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> serch is not back.
17:48:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> me too
17:48:41 <registered_mirc> here's a hit: it's close to my age
17:48:42 <the_tasteful_nerd> .q dan
17:49:14 <registered_mirc> there are like 3 maybe 4 whos names i did not know or remember
17:49:23 <NORG> i would have to think for me but its not that many i just have a bad memory + lack of emotional connection even w/ people i genuinely was in "wuv" with
17:49:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dont begrudge anyone hooking up but i've been in a monogamous relationship for longer in my life than i have not been
17:49:42 <the_tasteful_nerd> so i cant even really envision it properly
17:49:43 <registered_mirc> yeah you have dude
17:49:55 <the`shima> the hottest thing i ever masturbated to was this electronic music video 10 years ago or so that depicted the book of genesis and birth of adam. like this very hot guy was naked and emerged from mud and then they projected human works of art/culture on his body as he stood up. i've spent years trying to find it and have never seen it. it was tremendous
17:49:58 <registered_mirc> your relationship with windsor is the stuff of legend
17:50:03 <bonegar> in my experience, there's really nothing you can do. you can love someone, be there for them, do everything you can, but it'll never be enough.
17:50:08 <lavender_toni> incredibly mishima posting
17:50:09 <bonegar> unless it is
17:50:13 <NORG> me to person i love: I love you. [in my brain: i wonder if they get off the island]
17:50:20 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
17:50:37 <registered_mirc> lol
17:50:52 <bonegar> better to get into cars or video games
17:51:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah bonegar that's what happened with steve and why i am having so much trouble with it
17:51:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no matter what i did it didn't really matter
17:51:36 <registered_mirc> that's very sad
17:51:48 <bonegar> yeah i feel you deeply. i've spent a lot of time with that kind of feeling
17:52:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he always had a problem with sometihng i was doing and if i changed it it still wasn't really good enough
17:52:25 <bonegar> yea... it's like they despise you for loving them
17:52:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and he would withhold affection and then get mad at me when i asked him to be a little nicer to me
17:52:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> sounds like His Problem
17:53:01 <registered_mirc> yeah definitely
17:53:06 <the`shima> agreed
17:53:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> who knows
17:53:13 <registered_mirc> it was projected on to you but that's not your fault
17:53:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> i mean the obv answer to me is he's insecure
17:53:19 <bonegar> i never really like.. asked for things, except like... 'you said you would be home at 6 and it's 10 pm and you haven't texted me i'm worried are you okay?' and then that turning into a big fight
17:53:19 <lavender_toni> yeah he sounds worse than steve the cat
17:53:19 <registered_mirc> ^
17:53:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> thats an insecure way of handling a relatiobship
17:53:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he got mad becausei talked to him too much
17:53:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he said it made him exhausted
17:53:39 <ajj2> i'm, erm, normal.
17:53:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
17:53:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like it's such a shitty thing to say to your gf
17:53:57 <bonegar> shrimp yea i got the exhausted thing too
17:54:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah steve the cat wold at least run in the room and slap u right in ur face
17:54:11 <dreddybajs> he seems like an asshole and you seem like a very nice person who deserves better shrimp1989dspinfo !
17:54:15 <dreddybajs> also new drip https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/xGVoYThE/image.png
17:54:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> "i barely talk to anyone" and then i see him talking to like 20 people on discord all at the same time nonstop
17:54:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah. he lacks introspection
17:54:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> or if he has it, he doesn't like what he sees
17:55:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> so he externalizes it
17:55:09 <the`shima> remember when alex had problems with his ex and she was like "you have time for your irc friends though dont you!"
17:55:15 <ajj2> rofl
17:55:16 <NORG> :'(
17:55:26 <NORG> if she only knew :'( :'(
17:55:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he definitely doesn't like what he sees and he'll "joke" about how he's a bad person
17:55:27 <the`shima> i miss alex
17:55:27 <bonegar> weaponizing anything in your partner's life to take them down a peg
17:55:29 <bonegar> it sucks
17:56:03 <bonegar> when someone says they're a bad person i 100% believe it now
17:56:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but he also sees himself as some selfless being but he'd refuse to see why i would get upset when he'd literlaly never compliment me or hold my hand first 
17:56:15 <NORG> im good 
17:56:17 <bonegar> because of 'jokes' like that
17:56:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah bonegar i think this really changes my outlook on that
17:56:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> people who say they are a bad person, are a bad person, but not for the reasons they think
17:56:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> 12:48 PM <registered_mirc> here's a hit: it's close to my age
17:56:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> mine would also be close to my age, if i were 6
17:56:46 <bonegar> i definitely come from the 'im a bad person because i wasted half a tomato yesterday'
17:56:55 <bonegar> but some people are like 'oh i'm a bad person' and they date raped someone
17:57:01 <bonegar> very much the 'we are not the same' meme
17:57:11 <bonegar> but with no jokes there
17:57:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> im a good person,
17:57:29 <lavender_toni> ive had some "believe people when they tell you who they are" experiences too
17:57:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> his mom doesn't like how he acts towards me but she says she thinks deep down he's a good person, she just doesn't know if he can get past everything bad that has happened to him
17:57:31 <lavender_toni> its a surprisingly hard lesson
17:57:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> theyre bad because they are using the "im a bad person" schtick to manipulate you
17:57:40 <bonegar> it really is
17:57:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and he did have an awful life but i don't think that really excuses throwing someone away on a whim
17:57:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he cuts people out very easily
17:58:04 <het> yeesh https://twitter.com/Bandcamp/status/1499068917947510788
17:58:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> Fort,    Night.
17:58:16 <bonegar> how long were you together shrimp?
17:58:18 <registered_mirc> this stuff is so triggering lol im like, why am i here
17:58:23 <bonegar> you dont have to answer anything or w/e 
17:58:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the last time he was here and we were on ketamine he said he doesn't know if he's capable of loving anyone
17:58:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like a year
17:58:30 <bonegar> ah yea
17:58:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and it feels very gay to be this upset over a year long relationship
17:58:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because it was just a year
17:58:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> im sorry mpg i love you
17:58:52 <registered_mirc> thanks homie
17:58:55 <registered_mirc> in a geode
17:58:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> :)
17:59:08 <het> you know what would be a good bot function would be if it randomly lied about someone else pasting a link previously
17:59:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> a year is a long time to be with someone
17:59:17 <ajj2> rofl het
17:59:22 <het> "wow, you idiot, mikev pasted that 3 minutes ago"
17:59:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
17:59:32 <het> yeah a year does not seem like a short time
17:59:36 <ajj2> that would work cause that mfer is ALWAYS link sniping me
17:59:37 <the_tasteful_nerd> code it and i'll throw it on the bot het
17:59:40 <bonegar> mine was 10.. so i lost basically lost all my 20s to it. rip.
17:59:47 <het> the_tasteful_nerd: what's the bot written in
17:59:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's awful, i'm sorry
17:59:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> pythn
17:59:52 <the_tasteful_nerd> python
17:59:59 <het> do you have the code handy because I definitely could do that
18:00:11 <registered_mirc> pop that sucker on github will
18:00:27 <lavender_toni> the girl ive been seeing doesnt drink or smoke or anything and she was aghast when i told her that id never had sex with someone for the first time sober
18:00:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> i could code one that does it every time but i'd be a bit out of my depth w/ the random aspects of it
18:00:34 <lavender_toni> different lifestyles
18:00:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dated someone for a little under 3 years when i was between 17 and 20 and it permanently fucked me up forever and i never got fully over it
18:01:17 <bonegar> mine was also a marriage so it was like... i think i could have accepted some things if it was 'just dating'... but it was like 'hey you promised wtf'
18:01:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> that relationship still feelsl ike it lasted forever when it was significantly less long than my current one. but i guess everything that happens to you when you are 17-20 feels extremely significant
18:01:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my mind got permanently warped by a 26 year old who whisked me away to portland when i was 18
18:02:17 <the`shima> clarence the baker
18:02:22 <lavender_toni> 17-20 are potent years
18:02:25 <bonegar> yea that's a big time for anyone
18:02:34 <lavender_toni> luckily i didnt do anything but listen to reggae and sit on irc then
18:02:36 <het> Homie_in_a_geod: wait how long have you been with sydney now?
18:02:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> this december was our 3 year anniversary
18:03:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that relationship sucked and i didn't get over it for many years and even after i was over it i still cried when i found out he was getting married
18:03:05 <het> oh okay
18:03:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> we were also friends for like 2 years before that
18:03:09 <NORG> gimme some reggae
18:03:10 <het> that seems about right I guess
18:03:11 <the_tasteful_nerd> heres the url history plugin https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/9Lts0rBO/urlhistory
18:03:12 <het> ah yes I see what you mean
18:03:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> gimme some reggae
18:03:32 <NORG> i was looking up old gfs the other week as one does
18:03:32 <the_tasteful_nerd> the`shima> clarence the baker
18:03:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> betraying my race
18:03:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> clarence the baker
18:03:43 <NORG> and one of them died in 2018 lol. very weird seeing that
18:03:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> yikes
18:03:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> that sucks
18:04:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the loathsome hands guy looks like he literally has aids or cancer or something now
18:04:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and it's really funny to me
18:04:19 <registered_mirc> sorry norg
18:04:21 <registered_mirc> thats sad
18:04:23 <the`shima> clarence the baker fwt
18:04:35 <bonegar> i feel a deep contentment in opting out of ever doing relationship stuff again
18:04:39 <bonegar> not a path for everyone though
18:04:42 <scoop_jackson> online dating is real bad thats what ive learned
18:04:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and another one does weird clown shit online for attention
18:04:54 <registered_mirc> yeah i am like not in a rush to be in anything again soon
18:05:02 <the`shima> drinking cum in vietnam
18:05:03 <scoop_jackson> my friends want to set me up with someone maybe i can get married that way
18:05:18 <bonegar> lol
18:05:21 <registered_mirc> as good a way to meet someone as anything else
18:05:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i want to be in a relationship but i am afraid of meeting someone else who will hurt me so i am not going to look for anything
18:05:25 <registered_mirc> better than a dating app
18:05:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i mean i'm not ready either way but i ahve no idea how to meet someone when i am eventually over this stupid shit
18:05:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> my ex who i broke up with when i was 20 is still dating the guy she left me for and as far as i can tell he is deeply unhappy but afraid to leave her because she is unstable. which is exactly how it was for me. owned
18:05:48 <NORG> any time i go out to dinner w/ my mom for a birthday or holiday or w/e she tries to hook me up w/ the waitress if its a girl
18:05:50 <NORG> always really cool
18:05:51 <the`shima> tbh i think a lot of my thoughts on relationships changed after watching anime. specifically vinland saga and evangelion during lockdown
18:05:55 <scoop_jackson> the only good thing about the dating apps is sometimes i match with someone way out of my league and it gives me a self esteem boost
18:05:55 <the`shima> the cringe man
18:06:03 <bonegar> yea shrimp, i think you gotta find a way to not be hurt when you confront the things that hurt you again...which sucks
18:06:07 <lavender_toni> i would recommend nic to every single woman i know
18:06:17 <scoop_jackson> likewise toni
18:06:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah tom the portland guy was like bitching about his now wife to me constantly before we stopped talking and he also offered to fly me back out there once
18:06:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol ugh
18:06:42 <scoop_jackson> lol
18:06:46 <bonegar> yikes
18:06:54 <the`shima> theres a bit in the final evangelion movie where they expain that although one of the characters was a loving caring person they were only doing it for their own happyness not shinji's and i'm like "Yes."
18:06:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> one of my other exes is married to some old guy in north carolina now and has had a baby with him, and the other one lives in philly and works at a cheese store, which is cool
18:07:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> all my exes seem miserable except the married one and my roommate
18:07:38 <lavender_toni> roommate ex
18:07:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> the one in philly seems good and the others seem bad but i bear none of them any malice
18:07:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we broke up many years ago but continued living together
18:08:06 <registered_mirc> i think goodness for art and video game
18:08:12 <registered_mirc> or i would be truely miserable
18:08:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we were sleeping in separate rooms before we broke up so it wasn't some weird thing, it was just like a formal ending
18:08:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we're just bros
18:08:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that was like... 6 years ago now
18:09:09 <NORG> my last ex got married like 4 months after we broke up 
18:09:20 <bonegar> lol that was quick
18:09:21 <scoop_jackson> lol
18:09:23 <eric> Lol
18:09:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> things probably would have been different if we didn't meet when we were at the most psycho points in our lives (early 20s) but it's what it's
18:09:33 <eric> Idk what's up with my exes anymore 
18:09:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> getting married 4 months after a breakup is epicv
18:09:37 <the`shima> the hudson river.... two years ago...
18:09:37 <lavender_toni> you prepped them well norg
18:09:39 <eric> We've lost touch it's been a while
18:09:43 <NORG> she ask me to marry a lot lol
18:09:52 <bonegar> i have no contact with any of mine, and i really have no desire to snoop
18:09:53 <NORG> but im like...i still live w/ my parents im not ready to be married
18:09:59 <lavender_toni> i dont know anything about the people i bfiedly dated like 10yrs ago
18:10:04 <lavender_toni> barely remember their names
18:10:33 <scoop_jackson> so i know one couple that got married from online dating but otherwise its all been from other stuff
18:10:40 <scoop_jackson> i would have thought more would have met online
18:10:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've only had one short relationship and that wasn't a relationship so muc has like an insane barrage of psychic attacks on my mind
18:10:43 <scoop_jackson> among my friends
18:10:43 <NORG> i only talk to one of my exes but shes cool we had a very very messy breakup but then like a while after both realized it was rly stupid to be messy
18:10:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the rest of them have been at least a year
18:10:49 <NORG> coz there were lots of things we like about each other as friends 
18:10:51 <eric> Think about how princes in medieval times felt Chris 
18:10:57 <scoop_jackson> lol
18:11:10 <NORG> they felt bad ass i bet
18:11:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> tbf NORG the last two guys i've dated have been unemployed and this last one lived with his mom until literally this past weekend
18:11:52 <lavender_toni> internet dating seems fine to me
18:11:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so i don't think that really matters for everyone
18:11:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> the day after i got engaged my ex from when i was 20 posted some cryptic stuff in chinese that was definitely about me on twitter and then rapidly deleted it
18:12:09 <lavender_toni> i think being a male vegan makes me very desired among my, uhh, target group so its easy
18:12:18 <NORG> o ya i dont think it matters for dating but just my own hangups i would like
18:12:21 <NORG> want to be self-sustaining
18:12:25 <NORG> before i think about being married
18:12:31 <eric> Yeah I have more (in quantity) deep relationship with people online than irl
18:12:31 <bonegar> i wanted to get married so i did. i think living in San Francisco and my partner making absolutely insane money basically made them realize being married at all was 'holding them back'
18:12:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> me too eric
18:12:41 <eric> So online dating doesn't sound strange to me
18:12:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol toni being a vegan woman feels like a nightmare because dudes get so hung up on my dietary preferences
18:12:56 <NORG> tom is that the stinky pussy ex
18:12:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> yes
18:13:00 <bonegar> so they got rid of me on our 10 year anneversary lol, so they wouldn't have to pay alimony or something
18:13:03 <eric> But the tinder game sounds awful
18:13:05 <bonegar> money's so cool
18:13:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like i'm gonna ban them from eating whatever
18:13:17 <eric> Maybe I'd be good at it though 
18:13:23 <lavender_toni> you need to ban them from eating whatever
18:13:26 <lavender_toni> accept no subtitutes
18:13:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've mentioned this before but i got dumped once because a guy liked cheese and didn't want to have to stop eating it/didn't know what we would eat together
18:13:55 <lavender_toni> lol
18:13:56 <lavender_toni> classic
18:13:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he came back and i stupidly accepted but like... it's not that hard
18:13:57 <NORG> my ex who got married quickly was vegan she would just occasionaly be like "your diet should be better" to me
18:14:05 <NORG> which in fairness was during me eating two double burgers from whataburger or something
18:14:06 <scoop_jackson> she was right
18:14:23 <bonegar> sounds like the cheese guy wouldn't have worked out anyway and did you a favor
18:14:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i love cooking for people and i will plan meals so that if whoever i'm with wants to eat meat or cheese or whatever it can be added to the dish
18:14:35 <lavender_toni> everyone has a cheese ex here
18:14:39 <eric> I'm going to eat this linguine Alfredo and I guess youll just have plain noodles 
18:14:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's really not that hard!
18:15:09 <NORG> my stepmom has a couple vegan brothers that are like
18:15:11 <bonegar> it was too hard for cheese-guy
18:15:16 <NORG> the cringe type that u think are just fake people
18:15:28 <lavender_toni> i wouldnt date someone who eats meat but i live in a nordic metropolis so i guess i can afford to be picky
18:15:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he was a weird freak who would j/o in the bathroom 5 times a day when we were hanging out instead of acknowledging that i was around
18:15:44 <NORG> lmfao
18:15:45 <NORG> cool
18:15:48 <eric> Wow
18:15:48 <ajj2> lmao
18:15:48 <lavender_toni> lol
18:15:53 <bonegar> yea i can understand certain dietary habits means it's probably just not going to be a good match for a longterm relationship
18:16:10 <lavender_toni> 5 times a day bathroom j/o cheese ex
18:16:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
18:16:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it really sucked!
18:16:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he also made 140k while i was making 34k and i had to buy all the groceries
18:16:38 <registered_mirc> uh
18:16:40 <registered_mirc> what the fuck
18:16:41 <bonegar> yeah there's something about like..
18:16:41 <scoop_jackson> thats wild shrimp
18:16:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like... i am visiting you... why am i doing the grocery shopping
18:16:52 <scoop_jackson> the grocery thing too but more the jackoff thing
18:17:01 <bonegar> guys who start getting into the 6 digit salaries getting absolutely nightmarish
18:17:07 <bonegar> just some kinda epigenetic trigger
18:17:14 <scoop_jackson> the real reason why bonegar and etc fight
18:17:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah we'd just sit for hours on the couch not talking
18:17:20 <lavender_toni> luckily not a concern for me
18:17:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and he would get up occasionally to go j/o
18:17:30 <scoop_jackson> lmao
18:17:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i would try to say something to him and he would ignore me
18:17:36 <lavender_toni> thats truly insane
18:17:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> cool i cant wait to turn into one of those guys
18:17:41 <registered_mirc> i guess im probably nightmarish now that im a six figure
18:17:50 <registered_mirc> but, i try to keep it to myself if i can
18:17:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> maybe in like 10 yrs ill go full psycho
18:17:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> that will rock
18:18:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i've literally had like one good relationship and the rest have been absolute nightmares like this
18:18:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't know what's supposed to be good and bad 
18:18:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and now i feel like i have too much baggage from dating some real psychos to like... function normally
18:18:45 -!- ajj3 [~ajj4@1F4EE97F:A2747E56:FAA93AE2:IP] has joined #phiz
18:18:49 <eric> U seem good
18:19:01 <eric> U got job u play game 
18:19:04 <eric> What else do you need
18:19:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's what i'm wondering
18:19:22 <bonegar> the emotional stability to maintain a relationship without projecting your pain into others in ways that undermine yourself
18:19:28 <bonegar> 1 and 2 are on lock but 3 is a trick
18:19:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i get very antsy when someone treats me well, it makes me feel like something bad is going to happen
18:19:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
18:20:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because that has generally been how things work
18:20:17 <bonegar> yea.. any complement is like 'not today, satan'
18:20:49 <bonegar> 'you're so smart' is something i would hear a lot and it always would make me seethe
18:21:03 <bonegar> tell it to your dog
18:21:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> thats unfortunate
18:21:08 <lavender_toni> glad ive always had a massively inflated self esteem
18:21:23 <eric> He'll yeah 
18:21:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my self esteem became good and then this last relationship happened so it seemed like maybe it was the wrong thing to work on
18:21:33 <eric> I'm smart no shit dumb ass
18:21:45 <bonegar> nothing genuine about complements
18:21:46 <scoop_jackson> i used to take you're smart as a compliment until i realized they were calling jeb bush the smart one because he sucked and they had nothing else to call him
18:21:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> fake it till u make it
18:21:51 -!- ajj [~ajj4@1F4EE97F:A2747E56:FAA93AE2:IP] has joined #phiz
18:21:55 <scoop_jackson> i have mixed self esteem
18:22:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> jeb bush is epic
18:22:04 <bonegar> yeah it's something you say to get someone to do something
18:22:15 <lavender_toni> i think youre smart nic, unfortunately you waste it on some real dumb shit
18:22:20 <bonegar> lmao
18:22:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
18:22:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> ya
18:22:29 <bonegar> as if there is anything on this earth besides dumb shit
18:22:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i love to fill my mind with stupid garbage instead of things that "matter"
18:23:48 <Nude_Riker> being smart is fake
18:23:52 <NORG> my online friend group got totally decimated bcoz my best friend fell in love w/ our other friends wife and then she also fell in love w/ him and now they're married instead
18:23:53 <Nude_Riker> being dumb is real though
18:23:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh my god
18:23:59 <scoop_jackson> both are fake
18:24:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> ahhhhh, my mind palace *surveys a vast garbage dump that extends beyond the horizon*
18:24:07 <bonegar> beign dumb as possible is probably the best way to live
18:24:14 <lavender_toni> damn norg thats cool
18:24:17 <lavender_toni> total drama
18:24:17 <NORG> it was cool
18:24:23 <NORG> it was insane drama
18:24:32 <NORG> coz the first guy she was married to, our friend, turns out he was a real stinker 
18:24:40 <NORG> so it worked out best for everyone involved really, except him i suppose
18:24:43 <the_tasteful_nerd> damn
18:24:46 <bonegar> lol
18:24:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> being a stinker is no good
18:24:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my philosophy twitter ex used to get mad because i'd watch stupid reality tv shows instead of reading Thinking Man's shit but i'm not the one who is six figures in debt to work part time as a dishwasher
18:24:53 <bonegar> what was his problem and why was everyone friends with a stinker 
18:24:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so who's the real smart one in this scenario
18:25:00 <lavender_toni> lol shrimp
18:25:01 <NORG> well we didnt know he was a stinker
18:25:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah think ur way out of that situation bitch
18:25:07 <bonegar> guess i was friends with many stinkers i needed to learn to 'sever' from as i got older
18:25:08 <lavender_toni> there are many kind of smart
18:25:08 <NORG> but he was just ur typical very controlling jealous bf
18:25:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> there is
18:25:18 <the_tasteful_nerd> apple smart
18:25:20 <NORG> like we'd play pubg and she would be in voice chat and laugh at somethin i said or my friend said
18:25:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> (eric is apple smart)
18:25:27 <bonegar> listing the smarts
18:25:33 <NORG> & after we got off voice chat he'd like go to where she was playin and ask why she laughed at a joke
18:25:39 <bonegar> ya got street smarts, apple smarts, book smarts *thinking*
18:25:45 <NORG> + had all her txts and emails and stuff forwarded to his phone lol
18:25:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh my god
18:25:49 <NORG> just normal guy behavior
18:25:56 <het> yikes
18:25:57 <lavender_toni> im in a good position where i spend all my working hours on stupid reality shows so i can occasionally participate in normie conversations but then spend my free time on thinking man shit and looking at birds
18:25:58 <bonegar> lol
18:26:00 <scoop_jackson> yike
18:26:04 <scoop_jackson> lmao lavender_toni 
18:26:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah definitely not an insecure person at all
18:26:12 <NORG> idr how it happened but it was me my bff and her in a call by ourselves
18:26:15 <NORG> and she just drops it casually like
18:26:19 <NORG> Yea all my texts go to his phone too
18:26:19 <bonegar> damn i'd love to see a cool bird
18:26:24 <NORG> we were like Hmmm...thats not normal u know
18:26:27 <NORG> epic conditioning
18:26:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dont have enuff time to do too much thinking man shit really
18:26:34 <het> I'm apple dumb because my airpods max are being serviced by apple for the second time in three months
18:26:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> which is free in a way
18:26:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> freeing*
18:27:33 <lavender_toni> in soviet russia, you service apple airpods yourself
18:27:41 <scoop_jackson> for the past few years ive basically only interacted with people that ive known for years and am close with, which is good from the no drama perspective
18:27:51 <scoop_jackson> but it is fun to meet peopel
18:28:02 <bonegar> i'd love to service my own airpods
18:28:19 <bonegar> but i dunno about those soviet russian guys, they seem to do a lot of lying tricks i can't understand
18:28:32 <the_tasteful_nerd> thinking about bonegar sucking off airpods now
18:28:47 <NORG> Ya i have a pretty small friend circle by design
18:28:52 <bonegar> well one of them doesnt work at all, either left or right ear
18:28:54 <NORG> getting close to new ppl is stinky
18:28:55 <bonegar> if i suck it will it fix it
18:28:57 <lavender_toni> i was thinking that a while back nic, how i hadnt really got to know a new person for several years
18:29:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> suck it off see what happens
18:29:05 <lavender_toni> it is quite fun learning about a new person
18:29:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> know whats pretty funny
18:29:33 <NORG> https://twitter.com/BulletTrain/status/1499021721055240200
18:29:35 <NORG> lets go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18:29:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> is i never talk about sex with my irl guy friends, which i think is a fairly normal paradigm for guys and their irl guy friends
18:29:54 <Nude_Riker> yeah
18:29:54 <bonegar> july 15th feels impossibly far away
18:29:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> sydney and her girl friends, who are always talking about sex, were aghast at this
18:30:01 <lavender_toni> galaxy brain https://twitter.com/BergAslak/status/1499069039053885449
18:30:15 <Nude_Riker> that is exactly the case i have observed as well tom
18:30:16 <bonegar> is this like a guy richie movie wtf
18:30:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> like my 2 best irl guy friends, i dont think i have ever talked about sex with them
18:30:19 <Nude_Riker> women be talking about fuckin
18:30:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
18:30:26 <bonegar> lmao
18:30:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> women also be sending each other nudes
18:30:29 <lavender_toni> yeah ive literally never had a conversation about sex with guy friends irl
18:30:32 <bonegar> im like why does this look so ugly and bad
18:30:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> talking about sex is uncomfortable
18:30:48 <Nude_Riker> this is probably part of toxic patriarchy and we should change it
18:30:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> probably
18:31:08 <Nude_Riker> but, i do not want to
18:31:10 <bonegar> maybe like...
18:31:19 <bonegar> 1 out of every 10,000 people should have sex
18:31:19 <bonegar> if
18:31:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> who gets to decide which ones do
18:31:34 <Nude_Riker> i am not going to ask my friend hey man you having sex with your wife? hows that going
18:31:37 <bonegar> allah
18:31:58 <registered_mirc> hows the peepin
18:32:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> you should
18:32:11 <the_tasteful_nerd> check in on your sex friends
18:32:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> did i ever tell you what my old landlord said about allah and hdtvs
18:32:14 <lavender_toni> this started playing in my head https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kNS-ELtM1Q
18:32:20 <bonegar> yea
18:32:26 <het> so fellas, how's the sex going?
18:32:28 <Nude_Riker> allah and hdtvs (angels and airwaves cover)
18:32:29 <bonegar> it might part of why i dreamed about allah
18:32:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/pisscop/status/1491810373963554821
18:32:41 <lavender_toni> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF0dLdIwVeI
18:32:50 <Nude_Riker> ^
18:33:03 <lavender_toni> lol tom
18:33:06 <NORG> https://twitter.com/Bandcamp/status/1499068917947510788
18:33:12 <NORG> Now this is awesomel.
18:33:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> lavender_toni: he was albanian and very possibly a war criminal who fled
18:33:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmfao
18:33:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> Fort,   Night.
18:33:45 <lavender_toni> my landlord is a giant megacorp
18:33:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> mine too
18:34:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> guys talking about sex is just that scene from nathan for you
18:34:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> in the "Guy Zone" episode
18:34:32 <NORG> sometimes drink grandsons pee
18:35:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> not just grandson
18:35:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> any little kid
18:35:06 <het> Homie_in_a_geod: lol
18:35:21 <het> after 5 it's terrible
18:35:32 <Nude_Riker> i dont think its even that men arent comfortable talking about the emotional dimensions/needs etc, because ladies sex chat seems pretty mechanics focused anyway
18:35:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
18:36:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't know how women talk about it
18:36:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> or men really
18:36:30 <lavender_toni> lol russia has a good crew left
18:36:31 <lavender_toni> The only countries to vote no in support of Moscow were Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria. Longstanding allies Cuba and Venezuela joined China in abstaining.
18:36:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> .y def jam picard
18:36:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> this is how men talk about sex
18:36:48 <registered_mirc> i dont talk about sex with my friends
18:37:03 <registered_mirc> except my bff one time but it was more of a serious conversation and not a bro-down
18:37:16 <lavender_toni> i only talk about football with my friends like god intended
18:37:41 <bonegar> my biggest sex thought is trying to stare at a man's penis so hard it ejaculates without anyone touching it.
18:38:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
18:38:10 <lavender_toni> worth a try
18:38:12 <bonegar> that's pretty much it
18:38:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats what paul atreides had to think about during the trial of the gom-jabbar
18:38:33 <bonegar> lmao
18:39:01 <registered_mirc> what if that trial was actually a sex game and not a pain game
18:39:02 <lavender_toni> "Putin, in a conversation with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said that the Ukrainian security forces are using Indian students in Kharkiv as human shields, the Kremlin said" feel like hes scraping at the bottom of the barrel here too
18:39:05 <registered_mirc> Try Not To Cum in 30 Seconds
18:39:05 <bonegar> explaining various tantric meditations, but like in mystical ways, not hollywood actor ways
18:39:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmao registered_mirc 
18:39:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> he puts his dick in the box
18:39:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> fear is the boner killer
18:39:29 <bonegar> lmao
18:39:42 <the_tasteful_nerd> 1:39:06 PM <registered_mirc> Try Not To Cum in 30 Seconds
18:39:58 <the_tasteful_nerd> BORED? TRY THIS WEIRD BOX THAT MAKES YOU CUM IN 15 SECONDS
18:39:58 <scoop_jackson> heres some sex chat with the bros i remember: one of my (dude) friends was talking about how he was faking orgasms (?!) in a relationship a long time ago and thought he was getting away with it but it turns out the person he was hooking up with absolutely knew and was asking another friend why he would never ejaculate contemporaneously 
18:40:16 <bonegar> lol
18:40:21 <registered_mirc> lol
18:40:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
18:40:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol steve just told me he's not coming over until monday morning which is the same day as the long island hockey game and the trip there is over 2 hours 
18:40:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and his drive here is 3 hours
18:40:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> i remember your friend talking about how he got an infection from getting poop in his dick from anal sex scoop_jackson 
18:40:44 <scoop_jackson> different guy but he loves to talk about sex
18:40:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's like doign everything he can to not hang out while still going to these games and it's going to be a terrible time and i'm dreading it
18:40:50 <scoop_jackson> (the guy you met)
18:41:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> why did he fake them
18:41:02 <bonegar> can you just tell him not to come?
18:41:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no because i already bought the tickets
18:41:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> well. you bought them
18:41:24 <bonegar> can you just not  give him a ticket?
18:41:26 <the_tasteful_nerd> you can decide who gets them
18:41:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
18:41:54 <lavender_toni> wait where do you live shrimp
18:41:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm more just bothered by how much he doesn't want to hang out without saying he doesn't want to
18:41:55 <scoop_jackson> unclear to me shrimp 
18:42:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i live in new jersey
18:42:05 <lavender_toni> cool
18:42:08 <lavender_toni> the cool part of america
18:42:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> acually u shold go "i left your ticket at the box office" and then, not do that
18:42:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> sadly ticketmaster makes you use an app
18:42:41 <bonegar> lol no just tell him you dont really want to go with him to the game with him or talk to him anymore
18:42:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when i go to his house to hang out he doesn't talk to me and instead sits on discord and laughs at his friends posts
18:42:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> fail
18:43:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i don't understand why he agrees to hang out when he just does that
18:43:08 <pubeman77> lol
18:43:08 <lavender_toni> go to the game with tom instead
18:43:10 <lavender_toni> hes much nicer
18:43:11 <pubeman77> that's so alpha
18:43:16 <pubeman77> negging hb10
18:43:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> ya
18:43:35 <the`shima> oh wow roman is selling chelsea
18:43:39 <bonegar> some people just agree to things
18:43:43 <the_tasteful_nerd> i think hanging out with a person who clearly doesnt respect your feelings is probably not good, for your self esteem
18:43:43 <bonegar> when they shouldn't
18:43:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's not that type of person is the thing
18:43:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> or good, for anything or anyone really
18:43:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> his mom is even confused by it
18:44:02 <pubeman77> he is emotionally stunted, simple as
18:44:10 <registered_mirc> tbh he's probably just Comfortable
18:44:11 <bonegar> put me in a room with him for 10 minutes
18:44:14 <bonegar> he'll break
18:44:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wish
18:44:17 <lavender_toni> disappointed that the chess smart guy isnt real life smart https://chess24.com/en/read/news/sergey-karjakin-shunned-by-top-chess-events
18:44:18 <pubeman77> lol
18:44:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he probably needs someone to tell him he's shitty
18:44:30 <pubeman77> bonegar will take him into the labyrinth....
18:44:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he hasn't even offered to give me money for the tickets
18:44:45 <registered_mirc> that person should be you even though it sounds like he would ignore it
18:44:52 <lavender_toni> bonegar even broke invincible alex
18:44:54 <pubeman77> you should go with tom to the game
18:44:56 <dreddybajs> karpov is the same lavender_toni , big government shill
18:45:03 <lavender_toni> how about kramnik
18:45:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> i think you should just stop doing anything w/ him, 
18:45:15 <registered_mirc> i agree tbh
18:45:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah any time i tried talking to him about things he should fix he got really angry so i just kind of stopped doing that
18:45:19 <registered_mirc> as much as it may hurt
18:45:20 <bonegar> yea it does sound like this from what you're saying shrimp
18:45:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i tried being as gentle as possible about it
18:45:30 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah i think this person sucks shit from your description
18:45:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
18:45:32 <the`shima> what about kasparov
18:45:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i mean i imagine he's just not going to talk to me after this anyway
18:45:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because he barely talks to me now
18:45:45 <registered_mirc> time to say goodbye
18:45:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah i think u should not engage at all whatsoever
18:45:50 <registered_mirc> smell you never
18:45:50 <bonegar> yep
18:45:54 <bonegar> this is what ghosting was meant for
18:45:58 <registered_mirc> ^
18:46:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> cause anything else is just being manipulated
18:46:07 <registered_mirc> definitely ghost tbh
18:46:10 <registered_mirc> as punishment
18:46:16 <bonegar> ghosting is a kindness not a punishment
18:46:20 <bonegar> dont punish anyone imo
18:46:21 <lavender_toni> from google kramnik seems like a passive apolitical guy which sucks but you know
18:46:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when he broke up with me he was like "haha at least i didn't ghost you" becuase this is how my last relationship ended, we were together like a year and a few months and he jsut.... stopped talking to me
18:46:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like... why would you say that while i am standing in front of you crying because you dumped me lmao
18:46:50 <lavender_toni> <the`shima> what about kasparov <<< do you know about kasparovs alternative chronology thing
18:51:57 -!- robophiz [~robophiz@B8C50673.F3C7BB78.33CA7D1E.IP] has joined #phiz
18:51:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> idk how people do that
18:52:23 <ajj3> its hard but much less painful then the alternative
18:52:25 <ajj3> imo
18:52:28 <bonegar> yea
18:52:29 <het> look at you suckers getting hurt, my solution is to never connect emotionally with anyone 
18:52:31 <bonegar> it feels like the only way
18:52:50 <ajj3> het is the master wizard
18:52:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i didn't really plan on connecting emotionally but he was the one who pushed for all of this!
18:53:24 <bonegar> i dont think it's something you can plan... but we all gotta ascend from the desire realm sometime
18:53:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he pushed me into a relationship when i said repeatedly i was nervous about rushing things because i wanted us to be sure it was what we wanted
18:53:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol!!! lol
18:53:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and this exact shit i'm dealing with now is why
18:53:58 <lavender_toni> this guy sounds like a jackass
18:54:05 <het> I agree with toni
18:54:07 <dreddybajs> yeah
18:54:20 <dreddybajs> and it  doensnt seem like youre getting anything good out of the current situation with him shrimp1989dspinfo 
18:54:20 <eric> Sounds like it should not be your problem any longer
18:54:47 <bonegar> if i'm undrstanding this right, you want to be in a relationship with him, and he doesn't want to be in one with you?
18:55:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> well yeah i never wanted to break up but i haven't brought that up since he dumped me
18:55:19 <bonegar> i dont think any words or actions will change that, unless there truly is a miscommunication issue somewhere, which maybe you can address in a very straightforward and clear way
18:55:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so it's not like i'm trying to get him to come back or anytihng
18:55:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he said he wanted to keep being friends but he's not even being a good friend so idk why he said that
18:55:56 <bonegar> its what people say to feel better about themselves
18:56:00 <lavender_toni> it sounds like hes just keeping you hanging for no good reason
18:56:03 <bonegar> just a kimarimonku
18:56:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he gives me one word answers and just generally ignores me most of the time
18:56:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and the one time i asked if we were good he got mad at me
18:56:39 <bonegar> yea it sounds like he isn't going to say 'no' to you hanging around him
18:56:40 <registered_mirc> i hate this guy
18:56:41 <scoop_jackson> sounds like my relationship with my mom in the later years in high school
18:56:52 <registered_mirc> im gonna take this dude and put him through a table
18:56:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and that's when he gave me his whole "i barely talk to anyone" thing when he literally just sits on discord in front of me and talks ot people all day while we're hanging out
18:56:56 <registered_mirc> rock bottom
18:57:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> instead of talking to me
18:57:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when i am sitting right next to him
18:57:20 <registered_mirc> [tay zonday voice] broken brain
18:57:29 <the`shima> a friendship should be built on similar forms of trust to a romantic relationship imo. like not the same but i highly suspect this guy has some biases in his head around what a romantic relationship/friendship is and by saying "i want ot be friends" he's placing you somewhere in his order without any respect to your own feelings or your agency
18:57:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and he gets mad when i ask what he wants to eat
18:57:36 <dreddybajs> but like why are you driving over there to hang out if thats what hes doing 
18:57:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> he sounds like a fucking jerk!!
18:57:51 <dreddybajs> it doesnt sound like its a good situation for either of you
18:57:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because i am a dumbass and also very lonely
18:57:54 <the_tasteful_nerd> dont be friends with jerks!!!
18:57:55 <dreddybajs> yea, he does
18:58:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> trust me when i say loneliness is preferable to being abused
18:58:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i haven't really felt lonely in years even when i've been totally isolated from other people so this is a new feeling to me
18:58:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/yR2RqsKI/image.png
18:58:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i'm not really sure what you do about it
18:58:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
18:58:55 <scoop_jackson> i just want to reiterate that 3 months isn't necessarily a long among of time to get over a breakup
18:58:58 <lavender_toni> i dont think hanging out with someone whos clearly fucking with your emotions is going to make the loneliness feel better in the long run
18:58:59 <registered_mirc> you separate yourself from it and move on as best you can imho
18:58:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> and possibly you guys could be friends sometime in the future but you need to not have any sort of relationship at this particular time
18:59:02 <bonegar> i definitely understand wanting to carry your ideals and see thrings through, and i think you can find a way to figure this out while still staying true to yourself, but it sounds like maybe some ideas need to go up for review
18:59:02 <the`shima> its not a choice between being lonely or abused imo. living in a social reality which is entirely concocted by somebody else is going to make you feel more lonely and its not until you stand up on your own two feet that those feelings will go away
18:59:06 <scoop_jackson> for a year long relationhsip
18:59:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like when we hang out we're not even like... "physical," it's not like that
18:59:17 <bonegar> thrings... the elden rings
18:59:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> the chinder chagger
18:59:51 <bonegar> yea, it's a lot easier to feel lonely with people around than being alone
19:00:09 <bonegar> sounds a million times more lonely to be friends with this guy than just lookin at a tree
19:00:13 <eric> I had a thought just now about how half the cabs I've ever been in the guys been chatting over the radio or something with his pals
19:00:39 <eric> I'm in the hospital and theres a woman here cleaning and chatting with someone in spanish
19:01:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> why you at the hospital eric
19:01:00 <the`shima> i think its *generally* good to be at least open to being friends with exes - trying to be warm, amicable, understanding, whatever. however in this case i think the guy is not respecting your own agency and feelings. by saying "you're a friend" or whatever he's relegating you in his social order and is not ever gonna acknowledge that a friendship to you (and others) is based on something very different to what he thinks
19:01:04 <eric> Anyway I just thought about how that's like me 
19:01:14 <eric> I like working and chatting with my pals at the same time
19:01:21 <bonegar> it's always cool as hell to listen in on those convos
19:01:25 <het> lol https://twitter.com/metaltxt/status/1499091943652933632
19:01:28 <eric> Sara's grandma is having kidney issues and blood loss
19:01:34 <eric> It's probably not serious
19:01:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm sorry eric
19:01:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> im sorry to hear that
19:01:36 <het> eric: oh dang that's not good
19:01:39 <the`shima> you're going to find yourself getting deeper and deeper in the misery hole if you stick with this cause you're scared of being lonely
19:01:45 <registered_mirc> lol het
19:01:56 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah its just reiterating the dynamic
19:02:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think part of it too is we have a lot more in common than i usually have with other people and we were friends before all this
19:02:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> you're describing codependency basically
19:02:36 <dreddybajs> ^
19:02:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and so it's just hard to come to terms with the fact that someone who is very important to me who i like and respect as a person does not actually like me at all
19:02:58 <bonegar> that's fine though
19:02:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol het
19:03:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i don't really know what i did to deserve this behavior
19:03:02 <bonegar> like is a one way thing
19:03:04 <bonegar> so is love
19:03:06 <registered_mirc> i know its hard to hear but this is not on you
19:03:07 <registered_mirc> at all
19:03:09 <registered_mirc> in any way
19:03:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> none of it makes sense to me
19:03:11 <bonegar> you can't really expect people to like or love you back
19:03:22 <registered_mirc> i can not understate this enough
19:03:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah. it sucks that thats the way you feel but.
19:03:25 <registered_mirc> this is not on you
19:03:28 <registered_mirc> this is not your fault
19:03:30 <scoop_jackson> ^
19:03:33 <the_tasteful_nerd> think about... why you respect this person.....
19:03:34 <het> I mean I can understand being hurt and confused when it seems like they did and they stop
19:03:40 <registered_mirc> *overstate
19:03:43 <het> but yeah this is not your fault
19:03:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> like, why would you respect someone who doesnt respect you
19:03:45 <bonegar> the totality of the phiz perspectives coming in for one big party
19:04:04 <lavender_toni> it doesnt really matter if someone "likes" you if their behaviour is harmful anyway
19:04:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah
19:04:12 <registered_mirc> 100
19:04:16 <bonegar> surprisingly diverse but pretty much coming to a consensus on this
19:04:23 <registered_mirc> yeah
19:04:26 <the_tasteful_nerd> their actions belie their true feelings
19:04:53 <the`shima> look if i put this bluntly i think you're really at risk of failing to realise you a unique person who has agency. you're going to beat yourself up and eradicate everything that makes you a good and caring person, all to fit somebody else's shitty ideas of what a friend/person they like/whatever should be. this stuff will eat you away until you realise the problem isnt you
19:05:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> wheres benji to come in here and say 'gay convo'
19:05:09 <the`shima> i sympathise massively but imo this is not good
19:05:20 <the_tasteful_nerd> anyway. im buju banton, and im gay
19:05:21 <NORG> [13:05] <Homie_in_a_geod> wheres benji to come in here and say 'gay convo'
19:05:37 <NORG> theyd just say Prinkle or somethin
19:05:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i guess i just don't fundamentally understand how someone else can treat a connection with another person so callously
19:05:41 <NORG> or .gis luigi penis
19:05:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> i can do that
19:05:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> .gis luigi penis
19:06:09 <bonegar> im not sure there's really much to understand tbqh
19:06:15 <scoop_jackson> ive been pretty mean to people so i get it
19:06:21 <bonegar> people just be like that
19:06:22 <lavender_toni> theres a lot of reasons why people are assholes
19:06:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive never been mean to anyone
19:06:31 <scoop_jackson> lol
19:06:35 <registered_mirc> yeah ive been super mean and sometimes people are just so broken they dont know how to act right
19:06:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> its pretty easy theyre self centered and how you feel doesnt really affect them one way or the other because the dynamic _works_ for them
19:06:45 <scoop_jackson> yeah
19:06:45 <dreddybajs> shrimp1989dspinfo: figuring out that answer wont make you happy anyway even if you could 
19:06:48 <registered_mirc> and they have no introspection so they dont consider how others might feel
19:06:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> at least it works enough for them not to change anything about their behavior
19:06:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats true
19:07:26 <the`shima> i think you have to be cautious of writing motivations on other people generally. like its easy to think somebody is just being nasty and bitter to hurt you. ive done it a lot and im almost always wrong if im honest. like ive learnt a lot chatting to exes, people i fell out with, and trying to be more forgiving in a "lets find some mutual ground way"
19:07:33 <the`shima> but this guy just seems to be a dick tbh
19:07:39 <lavender_toni> when ive been an asshole to people the reason has usually been because ive had extremely stupid and misguided ideas about myself and my relationships to others
19:07:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> a dick and/or emotionally immature
19:07:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't think he's doing it with the specific aim to hurt me
19:08:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but when i say he is hurting me he doesn't care and gets mad about it
19:08:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> like it's my problem or my fault, not his
19:08:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> he might be getting mad because he knows that its true but doesnt know how to deal with that
19:08:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> a lot of people do shit w/o knowing why they are doing it
19:08:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> pretty common
19:08:55 <scoop_jackson> get mad to deflect thats i thing ive done many a times
19:09:02 <NORG> Lets beat his ass
19:09:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> people really hate to be confronted with their deficiencies and sometimes will jump through an incredible amount of hoops to avoid dealing with them
19:09:09 <bonegar> like when someone cuts you off in traffic and then gets mad at you about it
19:09:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> the rationale isnt really all that important
19:09:16 <bonegar> anger is a powerful deflector for sure
19:09:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think ive been guilty of that at times
19:10:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> i get annoyed at very stupid shit a lot of the time and its totally my fault, but there was a time when i refused to, or at least hadnt learned how to, accept that it was my fault
19:10:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i have learned how not to vent that annoyance on people who do not deserve it
19:10:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> but it took a long time to figure that out
19:11:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when we first started dating he described himself as someone who likes to talk out issues with a girlfriend and this and that and said he went to therapy and worked on himself and used to have anger issues but doesn't anymore
19:11:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but the exact opposite of all of that turned out to be true
19:11:51 <lavender_toni> back in the days when i was faced with any kind of problem my first instinct was always to ignore it or get mad about the suggestion that it is a problem, and i cannot really retrospectively explain why that was
19:11:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> that sucks
19:11:53 <registered_mirc> ugh
19:11:53 <bonegar> saying the thing you want to be aspirationally instead of the thing you are i guess
19:11:58 <registered_mirc> hes lying to himself and you
19:12:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> how do you even figure out if someone is lying about that stuff
19:12:10 <bonegar> half way to halfway of an introspection
19:12:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> people definitely think that just understanding what the work is is equal to having done the work, sometimes
19:12:19 <scoop_jackson> lavender_toni: im still big on the first tactic
19:12:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> dealing with problems is harder
19:12:22 <registered_mirc> well in this case his actions are the tell
19:12:25 <the_tasteful_nerd> than ignoring them
19:12:26 <the_tasteful_nerd> or fixing them
19:12:29 <the_tasteful_nerd> in most cases
19:12:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i do believe he went to therapy but he definitely doesn't like talking about things and he definitely gets mad constantly
19:12:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> you were just preserving mental bandwidth for the important stuff toni
19:12:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> like birds
19:13:02 <registered_mirc> he probably went to therapy, lots of people go to therapy, and dont actually work on themselves
19:13:44 <scoop_jackson> sometimes we aren't the best judge of our own character so i can see how if he thought he really wanted to be in a relationship he would present an aspirational version of himself that he also thought would appeal to you
19:13:49 <bonegar> yea therapy is like.. idk lol... not magical
19:13:55 <registered_mirc> right
19:13:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> cant wait to see how therapy works out w/ my brother in law
19:13:59 <registered_mirc> just showing up is good
19:13:59 <ajj3> a """fun""" thing abt therapy is that abusive people who go to therapy often dont get better but instead just get way better at learning how to mainpulate people
19:14:02 <registered_mirc> but you have to do work
19:14:04 <registered_mirc> it's work
19:14:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> which sounds like he might be headed for a BPD diagnosis
19:14:29 <registered_mirc> ajj3: that's what was said in the sopranos about tony
19:14:33 <lavender_toni> bpd seems grim
19:14:34 <scoop_jackson> did you get your car fixed
19:14:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> which is awesome
19:14:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> no
19:14:37 <bonegar> my therapy experience was accidentally making my therapist cry, mostly apologizing and pretending i'm fine and then realizing i had spent thousands of dollars before i could even ramp up into talking about my issues, then quit
19:14:46 <scoop_jackson> ;/
19:14:51 <lavender_toni> build character
19:14:52 <lavender_toni> s
19:14:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> i'm taking a page from toni's book and ignorning it as a problem
19:14:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> sometimes people are only willing to accept that they have issues because its an excuse for the consequences of the issues
19:15:04 <registered_mirc> bpd is absolutely grim, i have seen it up close and personal
19:15:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he has had a very difficult life
19:15:14 <scoop_jackson> i stopped going to therapy cuz it didnt fit well with a new work schedule 
19:15:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> all of his siblings have died
19:15:26 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah i really am a bit worried about his wife and kids
19:15:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> like 'a therapist told me i have anger problems' is a golden ticket for some people with anger problems to keep having anger problems
19:15:32 <registered_mirc> having a difficult life doesnt excuse his behavior tho
19:15:36 <registered_mirc> maybe it explains it
19:15:37 <the_tasteful_nerd> his blow ups are not good for young children to experience
19:15:54 <dreddybajs> shrimp1989dspinfo: you keep talking about him and why hes like this and what makes him tick, as your friends we would like you to think about yourself 
19:15:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> bpd is very bad
19:16:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he used grief as a shield and i once tried telling him that he needs to consider my feelings in the context of everytihng but i think he took that as me saying he needed to get over it
19:16:08 <bonegar> therapy seemed very good for my ex, but bad for me.. in that they felt very okay about the horrible shit they did because they learned to forgive themselves... nevermind the people they hurt lol
19:16:11 <bonegar> therapy isnt for that
19:16:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when i just meant that he needed to consider how his grief affects the relationship and try ot work through it with me
19:16:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah i hope that is NOT the diagnosis my brother in law gets fwiw
19:16:28 <the_tasteful_nerd> but it seems like it might be it
19:16:30 <ajj3> <Homie_in_a_geod> like 'a therapist told me i have anger problems' is a golden ticket for some people with anger problems to keep having anger problems < yeah agreed
19:16:41 <bonegar> yurp
19:16:59 <registered_mirc> my therapist has been very good about not labelling what's going on with me
19:17:09 <registered_mirc> which helps me not fall into one thing or another
19:17:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i mostly had bad experiences with therapy
19:17:20 <registered_mirc> he wont even let me say i have depression
19:17:21 <lavender_toni> this is getting a bit gossipy but annis family has had a lot of issues and right after we broke up her brother, who was supposed to be The Normal One, went into a psychosis from like a bad shroom trip, and im just like Finally this fucking shit isnt my problem anymore
19:17:30 <scoop_jackson> you have like a jungian therapist right registered_mirc ?
19:17:31 <ajj3> also seen hella mainpulative dudes who go to therapy just enough to learn words like "emotional labor" and "gaslightning" and "toxic behavior" and then use that to just be even shitter and mainpulative
19:17:36 <registered_mirc> yeah scoop_jackson
19:17:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the one before my last one called my problems "very interesting" and said she wasn't sure how to treat them
19:17:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeesh lavender_toni 
19:17:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> my therapist tells me i have a very mature and grounded perspective on life and its issues
19:17:48 <bonegar> oof toni 
19:17:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> i am a mental health expert.
19:17:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> i got it all figured out
19:17:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> fwiw ajj he hates phrases like that lol
19:18:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> so you can ask me anything
19:18:15 <ajj3> lol
19:18:19 <the_tasteful_nerd> my therapist should be paying me actually
19:18:19 <registered_mirc> lol
19:18:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive only ever been gaslit by matt
19:18:34 <het> will got plat on mental health
19:18:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i last went to therapy in 2019 and  my therapist was cool but she had surgery and quit the practice
19:18:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> ya
19:18:37 <registered_mirc> not acknowledge weakness could be a problem
19:19:10 <bonegar> yea i think like... finding a good therapist is tricky, and even then they might not be able to help you beyond identifying cognitive behavioral issues and being like 'do you want to do a workbook?' lol
19:19:11 <the_tasteful_nerd> well going thru one of the worst things a person can go thru and coming out on the other end of it has i think galvanized me a bit
19:19:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> though it took a while
19:19:28 <the_tasteful_nerd> but there's a bit of power in it
19:19:34 <registered_mirc> yeah i can only imagine
19:19:36 <lavender_toni> <Homie_in_a_geod> ive only ever been gaslit by matt <<< what about eric and pizza
19:19:44 <registered_mirc> i dont want to imagine frankly
19:19:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> that wasnt gaslighting that was just lying
19:19:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i guess i did work on a lot of stuff then and that's how my self esteem got better but it feels like it was kind of pointless because bad things keep happening anyway
19:19:49 <registered_mirc> lol
19:19:55 <registered_mirc> well, fwiw
19:19:59 <registered_mirc> therapy is The place for bad things
19:20:04 <registered_mirc> and encountering them
19:20:11 <het> now Homie_in_a_geod is gaslighting us about eric's gaslighting
19:20:13 <registered_mirc> if it was all good, we would probably never learn anything
19:20:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> like i feel like if that happens to you you can either be irrevocably broken or kinda learn to shrug away a lot of the nonsense
19:20:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i haven't gone in a couple years because my therapist quit and she's the only good one i've ever had
19:20:34 <eric> Iirc also the pizza thing began I think as a misunderstanding 
19:21:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> generally for me, therapy has been most effective when a therapist is able to locate the things that i have an acute emotional (ie not rational) response to and probing them until im forced to really figure out why i have that response
19:21:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> registered_mirc: the darkest most ironic thing about the whole situation is that like just 2 months before it happened i had thought to myself "i'm pretty blessed, nothing _really_ bad has ever happened to me"
19:21:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> which wasnt exactly true but not life altering to that degree
19:21:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> Pretty funny!
19:21:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i know why i respond to things the way i do, i know the sources to basically all my actions and weird issues, i just don't know how to stop doing and thinking all the bad things and no one else has been able to figure that out either
19:21:57 <registered_mirc> the_tasteful_nerd: christ
19:22:13 <registered_mirc> that would fuck me up so badly
19:22:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> that God fella
19:22:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> because if im forced to answer and talk about these things it becomes obvious how the internal logic of them is strictly emotional and not rational
19:22:18 <the_tasteful_nerd> he's a cad
19:22:37 <registered_mirc> lesser things have fucked me up irreparably
19:22:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> he reads CAD
19:22:45 <bonegar> im not convinced its possible to be rational
19:22:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> he's a dad
19:22:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> hes a chad
19:23:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> thats jesus
19:23:10 <scoop_jackson> yeah i think a lot of growing up for me is releasing actually im not a calculating machine and i systematically react to stuff emotionally
19:23:11 <the_tasteful_nerd> god's the dad
19:23:15 <bonegar> zaddy jesus
19:23:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> jesus is the chad
19:23:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> and the holy spirit is.... uh..... rad?
19:23:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i am very emotional
19:23:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> its possible to be rational in the way that i am talking about
19:23:33 <bonegar> the holy spirit is my personal fav
19:23:37 <bonegar> love dat guy
19:23:41 <registered_mirc> im a chad, im a lad, im a mother fuckin dad
19:23:48 <lavender_toni> its impossible to be rational
19:24:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> anyway its funny that my mother in law still like wants us to believe in god and shit after all that
19:24:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> im like are u kidding me
19:24:06 <lavender_toni> ive never impregnated a woman
19:24:06 <bonegar> no idea what rational even means, you'd have to be like a rock or a star or something
19:24:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> allow me to phrase this in a different way
19:24:12 <registered_mirc> the holy spirit is the one who makes people freak out in church and spaz
19:24:14 <registered_mirc> pretty cool
19:24:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> if theres a god he's a big fuckin jerk!
19:24:38 <bonegar> yea the holy spirit is absolutely goated
19:24:42 <registered_mirc> yeah hes on my shitlist
19:25:10 <registered_mirc> lol
19:25:15 <italiandecisiontheorist> rational means complete and transitive preferences
19:25:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> cant say im a fan
19:25:23 <alansmithee_> i've never gone to therapy because if i'm having issues i should be able to fix them myself through sheer willpower and determination and inner strength
19:25:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> it is possible for the way you respond to most things to be based on a consistent internal logic, and it is also possible for the way you respond to certain things to be viscerally charged by emotion, and when you break down the latter response you find that the internal logic does not hold there
19:25:39 <alansmithee_> however i respect what it can do for other people and am pro-therapy
19:25:40 <dreddybajs> alansmithee_: does that work for physical ailments too
19:25:50 <lavender_toni> ive never gone to therapy because im perfect
19:25:53 <alansmithee_> somewhat, yes
19:26:06 <alansmithee_> in that i've not gone to a doctor since i lost my job about 3 years ago
19:26:10 <alansmithee_> and didn't go much before that
19:26:11 <lavender_toni> lmao https://www.instagram.com/p/CanAZ_zqV-v/
19:26:24 <bonegar> god's fine, it's just a direction infinitely far away to aspire to, im sure god could learn a lot from God
19:26:36 <registered_mirc> i have to do a one on on with my boss in 5 minutes
19:26:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> beam me up softboi ftw
19:26:45 <registered_mirc> which he always labels the meeting as '1v1'
19:26:46 <registered_mirc> i hate it
19:26:52 <eric> Lol
19:26:53 <registered_mirc> why it gotta be versus
19:26:56 <bonegar> lol
19:26:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
19:27:00 <bonegar> you should address that
19:27:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> i usually see it as 1:1
19:27:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.instagram.com/p/CaDR9hxKr4F/
19:27:10 <bonegar> in your 1v1, ask him to ya
19:27:10 <registered_mirc> thats what it should be
19:27:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmfao
19:27:15 <eric> Or 121
19:27:16 <bonegar> address this 
19:27:17 <lavender_toni> cant believe some of you are at work and talking this much here
19:27:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> tell him thats unnecessarily adversarial 
19:27:23 <bonegar> im screaming you must ADDRESS this
19:27:27 <bonegar> yes
19:27:28 <registered_mirc> lol
19:27:29 <eric> When I worked at fisheries my boss called them bilats
19:27:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> blyats
19:27:43 <lavender_toni> the abelard guy ftw
19:27:44 <bonegar> the POINT of the one on one is to ADDRESS things like how 1v1 is wrong
19:27:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> 30% of my work is waiting on progress bars toni
19:27:54 <the_tasteful_nerd> theres a lot of gaps to fill
19:27:57 <alansmithee_> if it's a 1v1 you should be able to force him to submit and then take his job
19:27:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm doing work right now
19:28:03 <registered_mirc> lol alan
19:28:03 <alansmithee_> that's how it works
19:28:04 <bonegar> lol yes alan
19:28:10 <registered_mirc> i have to take his head
19:28:12 <the_tasteful_nerd> lmao
19:28:15 <eric> I'm making flash cards
19:28:15 <registered_mirc> and gain his power
19:28:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> Now I'M the boss
19:28:18 <alansmithee_> maybe he's a highlander
19:28:26 <alansmithee_> and he's searching for other highlanders this way
19:28:27 <bonegar> go in fully combative, so you finally wanted to 1v1 me bro
19:28:32 <the_tasteful_nerd> let us know how many runes u get from him
19:28:34 <bonegar> ready for a dirt nap
19:28:35 <scoop_jackson> <lavender_toni> ... 
19:28:35 <scoop_jackson> cant believe some of you are at work and talking this much here <- i definitely should be but im great at rationalizing
19:28:39 <registered_mirc> this mf doesnt know i pumped ADP so my iframes are long
19:28:43 <ajj3> ;p;
19:28:46 <lavender_toni> 100% of my work today was pretending to know korean
19:28:52 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
19:28:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> cool work day
19:28:59 <alansmithee_> registered_mirc: you better bring your pet jellyfish just in case
19:29:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmao https://www.instagram.com/p/CZNG3HVqW11/
19:29:06 <registered_mirc> i got my skeleton squad
19:29:08 <scoop_jackson> "can take it easy today, monthly computations are still running, already made a bunch of charts in the morning to give the boss some talking points"
19:29:25 <bonegar> i got the two archer skeletons last night but i haven't had a chance to play yet to use them
19:29:27 <alansmithee_> i tried the skeletons when i fought the leonine dude and he just 1 shot them all
19:29:35 <alansmithee_> i'm sticking to my jelly bro
19:29:36 <registered_mirc> they resurrect
19:29:42 <the_tasteful_nerd> im definitely guilty sometimes of the "I actually finished something that will make somebody happy today, time to fuck off for the rest of the afternoon"
19:29:43 <alansmithee_> oh shit for real? 
19:29:46 <registered_mirc> one time, but they resurrect
19:29:47 <registered_mirc> yeah
19:29:55 <registered_mirc> i guess unless the boss has holy
19:29:57 <ajj3> i found out today you don teven need to beat margit to get to the area behind the castle
19:29:57 <ajj3> wtf
19:30:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i always do that the_tasteful_nerd
19:30:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> het: did u see that code snippet
19:30:06 <bonegar> lol ya
19:30:14 <bonegar> i got all up in there before i had to go back to beat him
19:30:15 <bonegar> rules
19:30:25 -!- ehn [uid253142@synIRC-3B43673D.helmsley.irccloud.com] has joined #phiz
19:30:25 <lavender_toni> we're coming up on freedom fries territory https://twitter.com/idreesali114/status/1499061160460668945
19:30:37 <alansmithee_> lmao that's terrible
19:30:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> theres a lot of db operations that can be omitted
19:30:49 <alansmithee_> honestly i'm not quite at the ponit where i'm pro-russia but it's getting close
19:30:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> u you just need the regexp stuff and some randomizing function
19:31:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
19:31:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> freedom fries ftw
19:31:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> not sure how you'd grab a random nick though
19:31:31 <bonegar> one thing i do kinda miss, and it's still in the game, is the very slow progression you'd get in dark souls 1, where it felt like i was exploring but everything was so dense i never felt too lost
19:31:39 <bonegar> i definitely feel more lost in elden ring 
19:31:48 <bonegar> just like 'guess i'll work on this  area for awhile'
19:31:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> i'm torn on whether i'd like more item drops
19:31:58 <bonegar> but then the castles and stuff have the same vibe as that
19:32:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> but i also am kinda glad im not spending half my life w/ inventory mgmt
19:32:33 <bonegar> yea i appreciate they the weight limit is really only on stuff you equip
19:32:44 <bonegar> western rpg inventory management is dogshit i hate
19:32:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah nioh was like that i think
19:33:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lavender_toni nhl 22 is doing that as well
19:33:02 <bonegar> nioh was so intense
19:33:06 <alansmithee_> was it? i don't remember it
19:33:12 <ajj3> demon souls had that too i think, where your total inventory contributed to your weight
19:33:14 <alansmithee_> i liked the game just cause the chain was cool
19:33:29 <lavender_toni> removing ovechkin from a game will make all the difference
19:33:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
19:33:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> i liked nioh because it was like they grafted ninja gaiden onto a souls rpg
19:33:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> and i liked he ninja gaiden games
19:34:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> but, i probably would like them less if i played em today
19:34:12 <the_tasteful_nerd> because they definitely were frustrating
19:34:29 <bonegar> nioh 2 had a crazy system where there were a ton of drops that you could just convert into gold or mats or w/e and do bulk selling 
19:34:37 <lavender_toni> over here some mega idiots were sending hate mail to the national broadcasting company because they produce a russian news programme and its like uhhhhh
19:34:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah
19:34:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> you cold do that in the first one too i think
19:34:50 <bonegar> then you could also change the style of any gear you wanted to other gear so you could be in huge armor but make it look like a priestess outfit or w/e
19:34:52 <the_tasteful_nerd> like break stuff down
19:34:53 <lavender_toni> lets not report truthfully about the war in russian. that might benefit russia
19:35:01 <the_tasteful_nerd> the inventory shit was knda confusing actually
19:35:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
19:35:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> n 2005, Robert Plant and his band Strange Sensation released the album Mighty ReArranger, which contains the track '"Freedom Fries," an anti-war song whose lyrics contains the words "Freedom fries and burns and scars, the liberator goes too far."[26]
19:35:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
19:35:16 <bonegar> nioh was almost 'too much'
19:35:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> i think the item stuff was a bit much
19:35:42 <the_tasteful_nerd> ppl say nioh 2 is better
19:35:44 <bonegar> .yt robert plant freedom fries
19:35:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> ill play that some day
19:35:47 <alansmithee_> lavender_toni: what is the russian population in finland like? is there a significant one? i know they've had a very difficult history to say the least
19:36:19 <bonegar> you could jump straight into nioh 2 without playing nioh 1
19:36:25 <bonegar> so i would recommend that
19:36:30 <alansmithee_> idk if i'll ever do nioh 2 but i may go back to bloodborne after elden ring 
19:36:36 <lavender_toni> theyre like idk 1% of the population alan
19:36:53 <lavender_toni> so the largest "foreign" minority but not a large one in the way theyre in the baltics or w/e
19:37:10 <bonegar> can they drive their tanks into finland or are there too many swamps
19:37:19 <lavender_toni> unfortunately we drained them all
19:37:29 <bonegar> fucked up
19:37:38 <alansmithee_> fair enough. i didn't know if there was a comingling thing or what cause i feel like russia's always had some weird designs of finland but with that small a population that seems strange. 
19:37:38 <bonegar> i always wanted to see the swamps of finland, feeling robbed
19:37:42 <lavender_toni> st petersburg is the most liberal part of russia and most russians here are from around there so i think theyre relatively anti-putin
19:39:01 <lavender_toni> and russians generally feel positive about finland and there hasnt been any border conflict or w/e, so we're in a very different situation from ukraine
19:39:11 <lavender_toni> but ofc people would like to get into nato asap now
19:39:30 <lavender_toni> because turns out total psycho shit can happen
19:39:32 <bonegar> will it be so positive you will join the nu eastern bloc
19:39:50 <lavender_toni> the new eastern block being russia, belarus and eritrea
19:39:54 <alansmithee_> oh yeah i'm talking more pre WWII and around that time, i know finland nominally joined the nazis to fight russia
19:39:59 <bonegar> and soon to be ukraine
19:40:08 <bonegar> but maybe they'll stop idk
19:40:14 <alansmithee_> yeah i'm really sick of all the nato apologia 
19:40:16 <lavender_toni> well yeah my grandparents were refugees from the area russia annexed
19:40:25 <lavender_toni> but thats like not hugely relevant in 2022
19:40:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickle_lifter
19:40:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> Pickle lifter
19:41:04 <alansmithee_> well in the US at least everything old is new again! we enjoyed hte first cold war so much we're about to start another
19:41:07 <eric> They should make a big swamp that goes along the Russian border
19:41:14 <eric> All the way along 
19:41:17 <eric> Good for birda
19:41:18 <eric> S
19:41:38 <eric> Everyone can enjoy
19:41:42 <alansmithee_> also it's funny my friend's fiance/boyfriend is taking some humanities course and she told me he came up to her and was like "why is it the more i read about communism the more i think it's right?" lol
19:41:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> i finally got a summoning bell

19:42:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> i did both and she never showed up
19:42:54 <the_tasteful_nerd> seems like it might be a bug
19:42:58 <alansmithee_> Homie_in_a_geod: lol why does that need a wiki article? 
19:43:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> canyou eat the pickle after you light it up
19:43:03 <bonegar> is a pickle a type of metal?
19:43:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> but you can buy a bell from someone at roundtable
19:43:16 <bonegar> i think pickle might be a metal
19:43:27 <bonegar> .g is pickle a metal
19:43:35 <bonegar> .g how much metal is in a pickle food
19:43:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> should i go to the big fish store after work
19:43:39 <alansmithee_> ahh the_tasteful_nerd  i didn't know you could buy one. either way now you can get a jelly friend
19:43:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> where can i find this friend
19:44:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> i gota say the glowing pickle wasnt as impressive as i had hoped
19:44:26 <alansmithee_> i found it ine one of the graveyard areas near the start. there was a bunch of floating non-hostile jellyfish
19:44:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> oh yeah
19:44:37 <the_tasteful_nerd> ill check there
19:45:13 <alansmithee_> i wish i could be a bit more exact, that was from when i knew entirely nothing about the game instead of the mostly nothing i know about the game now
19:45:22 <bonegar> yeah lmao
19:45:28 <the_tasteful_nerd> its ok
19:45:32 <the_tasteful_nerd> general area is fine
19:45:36 <alansmithee_> i don't even know if i had the horse yet, or knew how to use it
19:45:36 <bonegar> teh first 10 hours of running around and picking up random stuff and having no idea where i was
19:45:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> kinda part of the fun is the hunt
19:45:43 <bonegar> i only now have a vague understnading of the map
19:45:50 <eric> I feel confident in advising you to visit the fish store shrimp
19:46:35 <scoop_jackson> dman
19:46:36 <scoop_jackson> toni left
19:46:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> we started talking video games again

19:50:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> *grabs nuts*
19:51:00 <bonegar> P-Nut
19:51:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> Behold,   two-handing
19:53:55 <alansmithee_> when did people start referring to "UX" instead of "UI" and is there an actual computing reason? 
19:54:16 <het> I don't know what you mean by "computing reason"
19:54:23 <het> like it's a more useful way of framing I think
19:54:37 <alansmithee_> like is there a functional difference in the approach from a computer development standpoint or something
19:54:57 <het> I think it's focusing on the experience, and the interface can come from that
19:55:01 <het> rather than vice versa
19:55:01 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah
19:55:04 <scoop_jackson> Yeah
19:55:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> i think its a broader term
19:55:08 <the_tasteful_nerd> than interface
19:55:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> i guess
19:55:31 <het> yeah it is broader
19:55:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> and also has a accessibility implications i suppose
19:55:49 <het> I think the point is that we care about the interface insofar as we care about the user experience
19:55:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> right
19:56:03 <alansmithee_> fair enough
19:56:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> the interface isnt whats driving the experience Necessarily 
19:57:01 <alansmithee_> yeah i don't know shit about computer stuff
19:57:28 <the_tasteful_nerd> hey het: can you see a way to do randomization in picking the nick out of the list and determining whether to actually reply
19:57:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> from that code snippet
19:58:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> the regex part is pretty simple but im not a python expert so i dont know the best way to randomly select a name and randomly determine whether the bot should lie about a previous post
20:01:12 <registered_mirc> hahah my '1v1' went swimmingly
20:01:18 <the_tasteful_nerd> nice
20:01:20 <registered_mirc> im in very good shape
20:01:22 <registered_mirc> nothing to worry about
20:01:30 <the_tasteful_nerd> shit i thought we were getting pto sellback this week but its next pay
20:01:33 <het> the_tasteful_nerd: which code snippet, sorry I missed it
20:01:35 <scoop_jackson> learn to teach computers to lie - a correspondence course by billy allen

20:01:49 <registered_mirc> The Lying Computer
20:01:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> ^thats the url history plugin
20:02:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> so stripping the db functions and just adding random num gen for determining which nick to pick and whether or not to reply is all thats needed
20:02:38 <registered_mirc> also they are absolutely positioning me for a promotion
20:02:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> thanks eric
20:02:43 <registered_mirc> he basically said it outright
20:02:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm gonna post photos of the fish in here
20:02:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> that rocks mpg
20:02:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the good fish
20:03:03 <registered_mirc> he said 'as soon as this year'
20:03:16 -!- totally_tits [~cgiirc@synIRC-385A46B9.res.spectrum.com] has joined #phiz
20:03:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> mpg does this mean you won't have to do the salesforce stuff anymore
20:04:03 <het> the_tasteful_nerd: looking now
20:04:04 <scoop_jackson> sounds like the carrot to make him do more salesforce stuf
20:04:08 <registered_mirc> no i still have to do it but theres no pressure from above
20:04:17 <registered_mirc> so hes like just take your time
20:04:25 <the_tasteful_nerd> cool
20:04:26 <registered_mirc> our team has the most people certified
20:04:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's better than before
20:04:45 <registered_mirc> only 3 people dont have it and there are other teams where nobody has one
20:04:50 <registered_mirc> 3 people out of 20
20:04:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my boss just sent out an email with a bunch of questions asking if we feel dissatisfied and how the company can address it
20:05:03 <registered_mirc> be honest
20:05:06 <scoop_jackson> lol
20:05:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah lmao
20:05:09 <bonegar> sounds like a trap
20:05:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm extremely vocal about hating my job and feeling like i'm not paid enough
20:05:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my boss is worried i'm gonna leave
20:05:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> we talked about it in my performance review
20:05:32 <registered_mirc> you should get paid more so you dont leave
20:05:35 <bonegar> ^
20:05:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah
20:05:37 <registered_mirc> thats how you get people to not leave lol
20:05:42 <bonegar> ^
20:05:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> unfortunately it's a big company and Big HR controls the salaries
20:06:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
20:06:03 <bonegar> how convenient
20:06:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so they probably pay consultants like 500k to say "pay them 20% less than average for their positions"
20:06:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> ah to be a consultant
20:07:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> being a consultant would kick ass
20:07:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i would love to get paid six figgies to do literally nothing
20:07:09 <registered_mirc> ive done some consulting and it does kick ass
20:07:13 <registered_mirc> people pay for your opinion
20:07:18 <registered_mirc> and "expertise"
20:07:28 <the_tasteful_nerd> i could do it
20:07:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> mpg wil lyou be in a position to hire an assistant
20:07:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hire me for 75k
20:07:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> a lot of hospitals dont have the money to hire someone to do what i do
20:07:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't have a college degree
20:07:45 <registered_mirc> neither do it
20:07:47 <registered_mirc> i
20:07:53 <bonegar> i have two, you guys can both have one
20:07:55 <bonegar> perfect
20:07:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ty
20:07:58 <bonegar> not even using them
20:08:01 <registered_mirc> cheers bonegar
20:08:02 <the_tasteful_nerd> but i dont have the grindset to do consulting wokr
20:08:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm good at doing what people tell me to do
20:08:18 <the_tasteful_nerd> i could make a lot of money doing but it would almost certainly be like twice as much work
20:08:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my old boss told me i should become an auditor
20:08:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but man that shit is exhausting
20:08:32 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah
20:08:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> not worth it
20:08:39 <registered_mirc> shrimp1989dspinfo: you might hate working at my company but if youre serious you might be able to get a project manager role
20:08:44 <registered_mirc> but i dont know how much it pays
20:08:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no thganks
20:08:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't want to be a pm
20:08:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't want to be a manager at all
20:08:56 <the_tasteful_nerd> unless u wanna grind hard for a couple years and stack paper and then chill after
20:08:58 <bonegar> being a pm sounds fun
20:09:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> but im not into that anymore
20:09:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> being a pm sounds exhausting
20:09:10 <registered_mirc> yeha
20:09:14 <bonegar> i think id be good at it
20:09:17 <registered_mirc> listening to pms is exhausting lol
20:09:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i hate pms
20:09:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i would be bad at being one
20:09:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm good at accepting a task and being left alone to do it
20:09:48 <registered_mirc> my boss was telling me hes on a project and the pm has him booked but is telling him not to bill because theyre not ready to start and have no designs
20:09:50 <registered_mirc> and hes like
20:09:53 <registered_mirc> well you booked me, so im billing
20:10:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> i think to be a pm you have to make peace with the fact that you are the most annoying person to everyone you interact with
20:10:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> and i dunno if i could handle that
20:10:16 <bonegar> lmao
20:10:19 <registered_mirc> ive had good pms before
20:10:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> pms are the hoas of managers
20:10:23 <registered_mirc> rare but they exist
20:10:25 <bonegar> i literally knew a guy who basically only had a job because of this
20:10:34 <registered_mirc> lol
20:10:39 <bonegar> just the worst guy and they'd dump him into projects because of his bad personality as punishment 
20:10:52 <registered_mirc> you wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world.... PLEASE DONT BILL TO THE PROJECT WE ARENT READY YET
20:10:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
20:10:58 <registered_mirc> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
20:11:10 <bonegar> when you're a big enough company you can absolutely keep a roster of disgusting gremlins on the roster
20:11:21 <bonegar> i always wondered how those people ever get hired or keep jobs
20:11:28 <bonegar> but now i understand, they're there to be bad
20:11:30 <registered_mirc> bodies in chairs is a thing
20:11:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> we have a whole PM office now
20:11:40 <registered_mirc> just keep the chairs filled
20:11:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> w/ multiple PMs
20:11:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> stop
20:11:46 <the_tasteful_nerd> used to have just one
20:11:48 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that sounds awful
20:11:51 <bonegar> lol
20:11:52 <registered_mirc> lol

20:12:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> look at this cat
20:12:43 <bonegar> love reverse corprate pyramids
20:13:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wish i was a soulless husk so i could be a manager
20:13:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah pm requires you to have Type A brain too
20:13:14 <the_tasteful_nerd> which i decidedly do not have
20:13:15 <registered_mirc> blech
20:13:21 <registered_mirc> type A brain are so annoying
20:13:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> u have to like, organizing papers and shit
20:13:24 <bonegar> type A brain
20:13:28 <the_tasteful_nerd> like genuinely enjoy it
20:13:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like organizing but i'm not type a
20:13:33 <bonegar> sorry i have sigma brain, another made up brain type that's definitely real
20:13:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think it's because i have a mental disorder
20:13:41 <bonegar> ligma brain
20:13:52 <registered_mirc> ligma brains
20:13:54 <NORG> type ass
20:13:56 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dont like organizing but i do like, being organized
20:14:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> the feel you get
20:14:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> when shit is organized
20:14:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> that rocks
20:14:08 <the_tasteful_nerd> but getting their sucks ass
20:14:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have to put things in a row for example
20:14:11 <the_tasteful_nerd> there
20:14:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> or i don't feel good
20:14:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and organizing is just an extension of that
20:14:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> thats just obsessive compulsive stuff lol
20:14:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah a mental disorder
20:14:44 <bonegar> organizing physical stuff feels great, organizing spreadsheets? not really as satisfying
20:14:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> i think everyone has some stuff like that but its just diff for dif people
20:14:52 <bonegar> just like 'why wasn't this made correctly in the first place'
20:15:08 <the_tasteful_nerd> like my wife's weird one is only wanting to eat m&ms in multiples of 2
20:15:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my last therapist was impressed i figured out how to function normally becuase of all of my stupid shit i have to do
20:15:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
20:15:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> It's a System
20:16:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> unfortunately this does extend to work which is why my old boss said i'd be a good auditor
20:16:10 <dreddybajs> fighting a tough knight
20:16:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because i saved teh company literal millions because i found a bunch of errors in a big spreadsheet going to a gov org
20:16:30 <registered_mirc> damn i am flyin high today so im gonna do more Elden Ring During Work
20:16:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> manually reviewing thousands of cells and coming back with zero errors

20:17:08 <registered_mirc> .gis the gayest simpson
20:17:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's terrible and i fought very hard to not be on that project ever again
20:17:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i just flat out refused
20:17:33 <the_tasteful_nerd> i maintain that any time you save the organization more than 10 thousand dollars you are entitled to at least 1% of the amount saved
20:17:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the pm wanted me back and like too ka tone with me because i told her i had primary responsibilities i couldn't set aside for that project
20:18:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and i just wrote a long ass email in response and she never contacted me again
20:18:14 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah i should have been rewarded but i wasn't
20:18:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> just "thanks we appreciate all the work you do"
20:18:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ok show me that by giving me money
20:20:08 <the_tasteful_nerd> ya

20:24:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> let's vc again tonight
20:24:31 <dreddybajs> yA
20:25:59 <alansmithee_> dreddybajs: that armor looks sick af
20:26:31 <alansmithee_> and i'm thinking i'm gonna try using a giant axe/hammer when i get the str. 
20:27:27 <dreddybajs> nice
20:27:32 <dreddybajs> a lot of the giant stuff seems to take some fait htoo
20:27:36 <dreddybajs> faith too*
20:27:38 <alansmithee_> oh shit bandcamp got bought by epic :/
20:27:40 <dreddybajs> if you're levelling that at all
20:27:43 <dreddybajs> yeah, grim
20:27:53 <letty> are there cheat codes yet for elden ring?
20:28:04 <alansmithee_> and i've not been leveling it, but i have some naturally from being confessor start
20:28:15 <bonegar> yea
20:28:25 <the_tasteful_nerd> im getting some faith rn
20:28:28 <the_tasteful_nerd> so i can use A Spell
20:28:40 <bonegar> sub to my elden ring cheats substack
20:29:19 <letty> is there a cheat like up down left right a b c start
20:29:36 <bonegar> oh definitely
20:29:42 <dreddybajs> yeah its called doing jump attack
20:29:44 <dreddybajs> broken ass move
20:29:48 <ajj3> lol
20:29:48 <bonegar> you gotta press all sorts of buttons to get powers
20:30:07 <alansmithee_> the jump attack is so good
20:30:08 <dreddybajs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/946608163711500318/948678540579184660/unknown.png stealth mode
20:30:22 <alansmithee_> lol sweet
20:30:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> jump attack isnt great w/ whip
20:30:31 <dreddybajs> my varg impression
20:30:36 <dreddybajs> .gis varg bush
20:30:37 <the_tasteful_nerd> but with sword its cool
20:30:46 <alansmithee_> ahh i just got the whip, haven't tried it yet
20:30:47 <dreddybajs> yeah with giant weapons its insane
20:30:59 <dreddybajs> it does so much stagger and it avoids a lot of incoming attacks
20:31:02 <dreddybajs> low and horizontal ones
20:31:20 <dreddybajs> a lot of boss moves instead of rolling you can just jump attack on reaction
20:31:29 <dreddybajs> its a bit much tbh
20:31:46 <alansmithee_> yeah although for me it's usually less "on reaction" and more "i'm pushing a button, and get lucky"
20:31:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> is dual wielding useful in any respect
20:32:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> or better to just have shield
20:32:26 <alansmithee_> i saw a dude using dual katanas pretty well and dreddybajs said the magic dagger is good if you dual wield those
20:32:37 <alansmithee_> i've barely used the shield outside of arrows
20:32:53 <bonegar> i use shield a ton but i have high stamina 
20:33:01 <dreddybajs> yeah if you do high dex build i think dual wielding is the way to go
20:33:06 <dreddybajs> for bleed builds and stuff too
20:33:09 <bonegar> very useful to get bosses off of people in multi
20:33:33 <het> the_tasteful_nerd: the issue is we need a list of current nicks, but here's just an example of how to do a random reply: https://pastebin.com/GcZjd8mA
20:33:34 <dreddybajs> one of my friend is doing dex fast roll build with 2 Reduvia (?) the dagger you get off the bounty invasion tutorial in the river below the bridge
20:33:51 <dreddybajs> i had to be summoned to his game to drop the 2nd one for him lol
20:34:24 <dreddybajs> also the_tasteful_nerd im just two handing my big str weapons now instead of a shield, it does so much more damage and stagger
20:34:34 <dreddybajs> and u can block with the big weapons a little in a pinch
20:34:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah im a high dex build so i dunno if thats the way to go for me
20:34:43 <the_tasteful_nerd> low str
20:34:45 <bonegar> i cannot wait to play more elden ring in...2 and one half of an hour
20:34:59 <dreddybajs> yeah probably not then
20:35:38 <alansmithee_> i kinda wanna do a quick dex build and try to play like hades but i have a feeling i'd get megawrecked
20:35:56 <bonegar> dex builds are extremely viable in souls games 
20:36:02 <bonegar> so i think they'd be viable in this one too
20:36:09 <dreddybajs> yea
20:36:24 <dreddybajs> you gotta be good at rolling but you can always raise hp and endurance for good armor
20:36:51 <dreddybajs> unless you want the fast roll where you have to be below 30% carry load ratio
20:36:54 <bonegar> my vit is pretty low
20:37:16 <bonegar> but i dumped into both faith and int like a psycho
20:37:16 <dreddybajs> i just got vig to 30
20:37:18 <dreddybajs> happy with it there
20:37:22 <dreddybajs> nice
20:42:09 <scoop_jackson> vit and vig 
20:45:26 <dreddybajs> theres no vit
20:45:35 <dreddybajs> there was but they removed it for this game
20:46:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> .wa weather 19968
20:51:34 <alansmithee_> ahh i gotta try that quick roll, i didn't know that was the threshhold 
20:51:51 <alansmithee_> also is there something that explains what all the defensive stats mean? like immunity and resistance and stuff?
20:52:33 <dreddybajs> alansmithee_: https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stats
20:52:36 <dreddybajs> i just read those now lol

21:27:30 <bonegar> https://i.imgur.com/hwtnBjR.png this
21:27:53 <bonegar> this is what happens when you type 'gerblin' into youtube
21:28:14 <bonegar> also just realized 'gerblin' is supposed to be a oh my gerd style pronunciation of goblin
21:33:45 <scoop_jackson> i like a lot of 80s style rap but this rap shouldnt be in this song imo

21:33:50 <scoop_jackson> i guess inflation is topical tho
21:34:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> im watching the tiktok cringe hyper comp

21:36:14 <pubeman77> sports article coments ftw
21:36:15 <pubeman77> Buch is not a 9.7M per year player. That’s ridiculous. Just because you make a half-baked Excel workbook and call it a “valuation model” doesn’t mean it’s accurate. Come on. That kind of “analysis” isn’t worth the cost of the subscription.
21:36:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> this is just mean spirited mostly
21:36:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> laughing at ugly/fat/disabled people. meh
