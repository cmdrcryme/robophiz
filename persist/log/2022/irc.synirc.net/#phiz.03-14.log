00:12:08 <bonegar> the basic words defense
00:12:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> i put the recipe for this Zhug into macrofactor and there’s a ton of oil in the recipe but because it separates with the solids you definitely are not getting a proportional amount of oil to what’s in the recipe when you eat it
00:12:22 <bonegar> i dont understand basic words defense
00:12:28 <bonegar> tell em about basic words defense
00:12:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh well i’m not putting cooking oils in for the protein because it’s too hard to estimate how much is actually ending up in the food so i guess it evens out
00:12:48 <bonegar> .g what's 'basic words defencs'
00:12:49 <dreddybajs> yeah anytime someone calls you on being a dick suddenly you understand nothing

02:57:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> not sure why we even still have it
02:59:27 <HellaBrad> Canada especially it makes no sense, most of us are waaaaay too far north for the daylight adjustment to mean anything. Like in a month and a half the sun is just gonna be setting waaaaay too late
03:00:02 <HellaBrad> We dont need to bother with it! It just messes with workers at this point
03:11:38 <scoop_jackson> china had it a for a little bit to copy us but then they decided it was bad after a few years
03:12:05 <NORG> damn wack panther was actually pretty good for 1 of those superhero things
03:12:39 <HellaBrad> i liked that the bad guy was actually the good guy in that one 
03:15:28 <HellaBrad> it's extremely funny to help the CIA kill the guy who wants to start a global conflict for racial equality and then open One (1) youth centre in Oakland as a compromise
03:37:37 <NORG> Change is change. 
03:46:57 <alansmithee_> 11:15 PM <HellaBrad> it's extremely funny to help the CIA kill the guy who wants to start a global conflict for racial equality and then open One (1) youth centre in Oakland as a compromise
03:46:57 <alansmithee_> i think that's actually the DNC's stated platform on race in the US
03:47:41 <alansmithee_> mikev yeah it's cool, i didn't remember both a) how funny it is and b) how graphic it is. 
04:31:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> troggis
04:31:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> finished the work i needed to do
04:31:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> feels good
04:33:13 <NORG> w00t
04:33:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> it used to take me like 3 full days of work to do monthly income reporting and now it takes me like 3 hrs
04:34:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> however; i will continue to pretend it takes me 3 full days of work
04:35:34 <NORG> lol

12:43:40 <Selfie_Dad> ffs
12:43:59 <Selfie_Dad> forgot to bring ollies sheet and blanket
12:44:07 <Selfie_Dad> now i have to make another trip
12:55:49 <Nude_Riker> the brittney griner arrest thing is weird, i havent looked into it much but... if you were going to take a celebrity hostage wouldnt you go for someone with a little more name recognition
12:57:36 <Selfie_Dad> who?
13:01:57 <Nude_Riker> exactly
13:03:00 <Nude_Riker> wnba player id never heard of got arrested on drug charges in russia and now a lot of people are claiming it's a political ploy
13:10:46 <scoop_jackson> i mean i doubt they arrested her specifically for politics but now that she has been arrested why not use her as a pawn
13:10:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> griner was arrested before the war broke out but she’s not being released is the thing of it
13:11:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> they already had her because she was already there, they can’t easily kidnap lebron
13:11:31 <Rusty> i can't believe griner is dating chelsea manning. wait how is it spelled. shit shit shit
13:12:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> also griner was a big deal because she is exceptionally big and is the first wnba player who can dunk; when she came out of college mark cuban also said he might draft her onto his nba team
13:13:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> christ i hate this guy https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1503276966874595330?s=21
13:15:58 <Selfie_Dad> someone should parody him
13:16:21 <Selfie_Dad> maybe grimes... parody-suicide?
13:17:45 <Selfie_Dad> lol damn Nude_Riker check out this new french restoration of three colors blue
13:17:47 <Selfie_Dad> https://caps-a-holic.com/c.php?a=1&x=481&y=289&d1=16940&d2=16941&s1=185423&s2=185438&l=0&i=4&go=1
13:17:53 <Selfie_Dad> more like one color: piss
13:17:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/doulbedoink/status/1503159489079484418?s=21
13:19:25 <Selfie_Dad> why does every restoration coming out of europe seem to have a piss/green color grading
13:19:30 <Rusty> ^
13:22:38 <Nude_Riker> holy shit Selfie_Dad 
13:23:10 <Selfie_Dad> yeah its so bad
13:23:14 <Nude_Riker> thats an insane difference
13:23:31 <Nude_Riker> you know that movie blue? the one thats all blue? what if it was yellow
13:23:36 <Selfie_Dad> all the europeans have piss in their eyes when sitting down to grade
13:24:16 <Selfie_Dad> lmao hell yeah im glad they got this one cap to use in comparison for escape from LA
13:24:17 <Selfie_Dad> https://caps-a-holic.com/c.php?go=1&a=0&d1=17191&d2=14261&s1=190119&s2=145937&i=10&l=0
13:24:22 <Selfie_Dad> there could be funnier ones though
13:24:49 <Nude_Riker> its a shame cause the scan looks nice
13:24:53 <the`shima> escape from la ftw
13:24:59 <the`shima> prefer that to escape from ny
13:25:18 <Nude_Riker> yes the`shima me too!!!!
13:25:22 <the`shima> f1 this weekend....
13:25:23 <Nude_Riker> and everyone yells at me for that
13:25:39 <Selfie_Dad> i can see how you would but i just cant get on board with it
13:26:02 <Nude_Riker> i didnt see either young so i dont have an attachment to snake as serious badass
13:26:08 <Selfie_Dad> me neither
13:26:10 <Selfie_Dad> escape from LA is a frequently compelling mess but there are things that frustrate me about it
13:26:15 <Selfie_Dad> i think i'd put em about even
13:26:16 <Selfie_Dad> tbh
13:26:20 <Nude_Riker> sure, but i think the tonal shift makes more sense
13:26:30 <Selfie_Dad> even though they're very different tonally 
13:26:37 <Nude_Riker> its a very fuckin goofy concept, escape from new york
13:26:44 <Nude_Riker> but its played very seriously
13:26:45 <Selfie_Dad> i guess actually not that different but LA reaallly leans into the silliness
13:27:27 <Nude_Riker> wow the difference in that ela screen is uh subtle
13:27:52 <Nude_Riker> shout factory seems to put good stuff out usually
13:28:24 <Selfie_Dad> yeah a lot of the niche labels seem to be eating the prestige label's lunch lately
13:28:35 <Selfie_Dad> shout factory and arrow really dropping science
13:28:40 <Nude_Riker> ya
13:28:44 <Rusty> arrow ftw especially
13:29:04 <Nude_Riker> i need to buy that multi region bd player finally so i can watch my uk arrow discs lol
13:29:06 <Rusty> i gotta go be in a meeting but you can bet i have some opinions on bluray labels !!!
13:29:13 <Selfie_Dad> i like that kino just put out a fully restored version of edgar g ulmer's venereal disease drama
13:29:14 <Selfie_Dad> lol
13:29:49 <Nude_Riker> arrow's covers are so fuckin good, when im browsing at the video shop i pick them up all the time even when i havent heard of the movie
13:34:58 <Selfie_Dad> damn arrow has a new chabrol boxset
13:35:00 <Selfie_Dad> that looks good
13:38:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> sydney made cookies that are very good but i cannot eat much of them
13:38:22 <Selfie_Dad> a tough spot for sure
13:38:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> new goal eat as normal and then fill the remainder of my allowed caloric content with cookies every day
13:38:34 <Selfie_Dad> lol
13:38:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have visibly lost some weight since i started this
13:38:45 <Selfie_Dad> hmmm how many grams of cookie can i eat....
13:38:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> my tiddies were hanging before and now they are not
13:39:00 <Selfie_Dad> i have made that calculus before for sure
13:39:05 <Selfie_Dad> the cookie calculus 
13:39:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> 1 cookie is about 59 grams and i had 17 grams of one this morning
13:40:18 <Selfie_Dad> checks out
13:40:24 <Selfie_Dad> what kind of cookie are they
13:41:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> oat
13:41:44 <Selfie_Dad> love a good oat
13:42:08 <Selfie_Dad> if you ever need something that is sweet to ahve around that you can eat a fair amount of
13:42:15 <Selfie_Dad> i had decent success w/ this recipe https://imheatherr.com/boos-ridiculous-brownies/
13:42:42 <Selfie_Dad> its obv not going to be quite as good as a real ass brownie but it scratches the itch and you can eat like 3 of them and only have 100ish calories
13:42:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> this is the cooky Selfie_Dad https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/5OhOdy8T/image.png

13:48:12 <Selfie_Dad> the meme god is back everybody
13:49:06 <Selfie_Dad> man if i have to drive all the way back to daycare it would make sense for me to go to my office to do a few things ive been putting off
13:49:26 <Selfie_Dad> but if i do that before i workout ill never get back to actually work out
13:49:43 <Selfie_Dad> but also if i workout i might not be done in time for nap time ftl 
13:50:07 <Selfie_Dad> i guess ill continue to Not do the shit I need to do at the office
13:50:16 <Selfie_Dad> i still have 12 days till my password expires anyway
13:52:25 <Selfie_Dad> wasting gas thats about 5 bucks a gallon ftl
13:53:19 <scoop_jackson> im sure that will seem cheap in a couple months
13:53:53 <scoop_jackson> well no im not but i wanted ot make the snarky comment
13:54:17 <Selfie_Dad> thansk
13:54:37 <Selfie_Dad> lol i look at what the top 30 movies are on the nzbs site from time to time are
13:54:40 <Selfie_Dad> as far as downloads
13:54:52 <Selfie_Dad> and uh, hypernormalisation is in the top 30 for some reason
13:57:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l
13:57:42 <Nude_Riker> lol Selfie_Dad 
13:58:16 <Nude_Riker> yeah thats always fun to do on torrent sites, normie garbage and then like one or two weird things because of either free leech or news
13:59:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> we have like 10 records that ive gotten since the last time i played any records
13:59:22 <Rusty> the Arrow Shaw Bros set is wonderful so far
14:01:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> you fail me ftw
14:01:55 <Selfie_Dad> theres a king gizzard/tropical fuck storm single?
14:01:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
14:02:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> makes sense i guess
14:02:05 <Selfie_Dad> cool i guess
14:02:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> "cool i guess" is my general reaction to anything king gizzard related
14:02:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
14:05:14 <Selfie_Dad> well u never quite know what you're getting
14:05:20 <Selfie_Dad> but i do like quite a bit of their stuff
14:05:42 <Nude_Riker> i will never listen to them based on their name
14:06:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> youd hate them even if you did
14:06:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/1iupcr1e/image.png
14:06:32 <Nude_Riker> seems likely
14:06:54 <Selfie_Dad> they do have a truly awful name
14:06:58 <Selfie_Dad> but, theyre good
14:07:00 <Selfie_Dad> sadly
14:07:24 <Selfie_Dad> they put me in the unenviable position of repping something with a bad name
14:07:27 <Selfie_Dad> .l
14:07:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> they are kind of like if thee oh sees (also bad name) really liked stoner metal
14:08:22 <Nude_Riker> i assumed they were from the 70s the first time i heard the name, because there were a lot of bands with bad names like that then
14:08:39 <Selfie_Dad> well also like, camel, and weird microtonal stuff, and west asian scales
14:08:56 <Homie_in_a_geod> i was being reductive but yes
14:09:01 <Rusty> lol i still haven't checked out king gizzard for that reason
14:09:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> throw secret chiefs 3 in there i guess
14:09:07 <Rusty> other than the one video John safran dances around in
14:09:29 <Selfie_Dad> i think if you vibe with any of the genres they play in, you'd like them
14:09:33 <Selfie_Dad> if you dont, you wont
14:09:34 <Selfie_Dad> simple as

14:21:07 <Nude_Riker> actually i wont but

14:21:25 <Nude_Riker> Grocery Stores (excluding Target® and Walmart®)*
14:21:32 <Selfie_Dad> other than its windows
14:21:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> .gis luigi's nuts
14:22:03 <mpg> it doesnt have any convincing reason to upgrade
14:22:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> consider this:
14:22:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> lose 11
14:22:11 <mpg> doesnt have to be actively bad
14:22:36 <Selfie_Dad> most os don't
14:22:41 <Nude_Riker> owned, my sister didnt get the residency match she wanted for radiology and might have to move to lebanon new hampshire
14:22:48 <mpg> i dont see how that matters
14:23:16 <Nude_Riker> .g lebanon new hampshire
14:24:00 <Selfie_Dad> im more addressing the idea that ita so bad as to make someone quit using computers
14:24:37 <Selfie_Dad> not your personal decision to not upgrade at this time
14:25:32 <Selfie_Dad> that level of hyperbolic comment led me to believe there might be something very wrong with win11 and i was curious what that might be
14:26:09 <Rusty> i've driven thru lebanon. it's in a pretty nice-looking region
14:26:14 <Rusty> super close to VT too iirc
14:27:32 <Selfie_Dad> NH seems cool

14:28:33 <mpg> blessed
14:28:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> generally windows adds more terrible features with each "upgrade" (i.e. incredibly invasive telemetry that you can't really disable, program bloat, etc)
14:28:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i really hate win10
14:28:49 <Rusty> win10 chugs ass
14:29:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> win11 has a bunch of bullshit + it's extremely ugly
14:29:02 <Rusty> i had to reinstall it so many times because of some botched update rollout they did
14:29:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> i like win10.
14:29:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they're getting rid of pinning things to the start menu iirc
14:29:13 <mpg> win10 is fine for me. better than 7
14:29:19 <Selfie_Dad> windows is bad
14:29:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and they're like... vaguely attempting to mimic an ios layout
14:29:30 <mpg> the only good os is linux
14:29:31 <Selfie_Dad> but win10 is "fine"
14:29:48 <mpg> if it wasnt for gaming that's what i'd be using
14:29:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> at least its not windows 8
14:30:02 <mpg> that's true
14:30:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> 10:29 AM <mpg> the only good os is linux
14:30:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> give me vista or xp

14:30:24 <mpg> vista lmao
14:30:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> but xp.... miss you,...
14:30:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> would rather have this than 10
14:30:28 <the`shima> anybody got any ps5 games o rec btw
14:30:29 <Nude_Riker> lmao vista
14:30:31 <mpg> surely you jest

14:30:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i fucking hate win10 so much
14:30:41 <Nude_Riker> why
14:30:43 <shrimp1989dspinfo> vista was stupid but it's NOT win10
14:30:57 <Selfie_Dad> Vista was baf
14:31:00 <mpg> ive never had strong feelings about win10

14:31:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> thank you
14:31:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> its hard to really have strong feelings about win10 i think
14:31:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't like forced upgrades
14:31:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> at least for me
14:31:38 <Selfie_Dad> win10 is the first ok windows since xp
14:31:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think its ever forced me to upgrade
14:31:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think 7 was ok too...
14:31:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i was forced to upgrade to win10 from 7
14:31:56 <Selfie_Dad> and xp was quite bad on release
14:31:58 <Rusty> Micro$haft Winblows
14:32:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i would still use 7 if i could
14:32:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> macro$haft*
14:32:07 <Nude_Riker> XPSP3
14:32:17 <Selfie_Dad> i guess 7 was ok
14:32:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> 8 was a disaster
14:32:32 <mpg> i had more problems with 7 than i've had with 10
14:32:35 <Nude_Riker> i forgot 8 even happened
14:32:37 <Nude_Riker> never used it
14:32:39 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i never used 8
14:32:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm also never going to make a microsoft acct because i don't think i should need a separate account to use my computer and the day i can no longer set up an os offline is the day i just stop using computers forever
14:32:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> i remember the first time i encountered 8, at my friends place like right after it released
14:33:04 <mpg> i kinda skipped over 7 though, since i was using macs for like a decade before i build a gaming PC again
14:33:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> and like no one present could figure out how to do anything in it
14:33:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
14:33:31 <Rusty> i feel like the 7-8-10 progression was so fast. i remember just getting offers to upgrade for free & going ahead with them each time
14:33:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah, there was no real reason for it
14:33:44 <mpg> 8 was panned pretty hard
14:33:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> 8 was designed for tablets lol
14:34:02 <Nude_Riker> yeah Rusty 
14:34:05 <mpg> ahh that's right, Windows Metro
14:34:06 <mpg> lmao
14:34:10 <mpg> what a shit show that was
14:34:12 <Rusty> i had a friend with a windows phone around the time of 8 and it was lol
14:34:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that is ANOTHER thing i hate
14:34:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> os/web desgin geared primarily towards tablets/phones
14:34:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> eventually they came up with an alternate display mode that didnt force the tablet thing but it didnt launch with that functionality
14:34:47 <mpg> "mobile first" is a thing in the web world at least
14:34:48 <Rusty> computer people love unexpected change
14:34:48 <the`shima> i had a windows phone back in 2012 for a bit lol
14:34:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> i agree with that shrimp1989dspinfo but win 10 doesnt do that
14:34:52 <mpg> blame normies
14:34:55 <Selfie_Dad> my only experience with windows in the last ten years has been in a work context mostly
14:35:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't like win10 messages that are like ooopsy woopsy! computer ran into a wittle error ):
14:35:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hate that shit so much
14:35:48 <Selfie_Dad> never seen yhat one
14:35:52 <mpg> give me abusive errors
14:35:53 <shrimp1989dspinfo> bluescreens are like that
14:35:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> never got that
14:36:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> there's a big frowny face
14:36:03 <the`shima> i think all my complaints about windows are usually to do with work computer and onedrive/sharepoint shit
14:36:04 <mpg> FUCK YOU YOU DUMB SHIT RETARD YOUR COMPUTER CRASHED
14:36:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> ive never bluescreened on here
14:36:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> also i don't like the new settings layout
14:36:17 <Selfie_Dad> never seen a win10 blue screen
14:36:22 <mpg> ive seen like
14:36:24 <mpg> 3
14:36:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> the settings layout isnt good i agree with that
14:36:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> when they pushed that back in 7 or 8 i just switched back to the old layout
14:36:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but now you can't do that
14:36:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and it's DOG SHIT!!!!
14:36:42 <the`shima> i find the teams/sharepoint/windows integration a nightmare when it comes to folders
14:36:48 <mpg> you can still use the old control panel??
14:37:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> why are settings AND control panel different
14:37:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> you know theyve been doing things like this for like 30+ years https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/P7PtnUVq/image.png
14:37:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> why not just keep control panel
14:37:40 <mpg> because some people could not understand how it works
14:37:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> so they made it bigger and added different icons
14:37:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if you're going to have a computer you should probably learn how to use it
14:38:00 <Rusty> .y 3 dead trolls in a baggie every OS sucks
14:38:09 <Rusty> i remember some kid in the AV club playing this when i was 14
14:38:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> woot https://twitter.com/AP/status/1503372654388121601
14:38:18 <mpg> Rusty: you might say, your OS is a POS
14:38:20 <Rusty> i hate that i remember the whole name of the dumb band
14:38:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't like that computers are dumbed down enough now that users don't have to learn anything about them
14:38:41 <mpg> that ship has sailed
14:38:42 <mpg> long ago
14:38:43 <Rusty> technology should gatekeep itself
14:38:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> i only know one song by that group Rusty 
14:38:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> .y ontario sucks
14:39:01 <Selfie_Dad> i ahree accessiblity is bad
14:39:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's not even gatekeeping, it's that people should have a baseline of technological knowledge since everytihng we do now is computer-based
14:39:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's not good to use things without at least knowing a little about how they work
14:39:20 <Nude_Riker> danielle said learn to code
14:39:29 <mpg> i know how
14:39:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm not even talking about coding
14:39:34 <mpg> advanced user here
14:39:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> just like... file trees and knowing how to navigate the control panel
14:40:01 <Selfie_Dad> nope
14:40:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you guys are trolling me!
14:40:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont necessarily disagree with that shrimp1989dspinfo but also the general public has repeatedly broadly demonstrated its inability to do that
14:40:22 <Selfie_Dad> archaic concept
14:40:23 <Nude_Riker> i mean, if those things no longer exist then you dont need to know how to use them
14:40:43 <Rusty> "it just works"
14:40:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they do exist though and there's no reason to get rid of them at any point because it's incredibly frustrating to no longer have access to them
14:41:03 <Selfie_Dad> to you maybe
14:41:12 <mpg> i think the idea that the way of computing OS that we know is the best way to work is not right
14:41:21 <mpg> it's just familiar, at best
14:41:31 <Nude_Riker> its frustrating to me as well, because that is how i learned to interact with my computer, but the computer is changing
14:41:39 <Selfie_Dad> im afraid you're going to have to blame good old capitalism for this one as well
14:41:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't want to be talked down to like i'm an idiot by my computer
14:41:56 <Selfie_Dad> its corporations prerogative to broaden their userbase as wide as possible
14:41:58 <Rusty> need an analogous slogan to phil spector's "BACK TO MONO" for compies
14:42:06 <Selfie_Dad> well i've got the solution for you: 
14:42:08 <Selfie_Dad> install gentoo
14:42:12 <mpg> ^
14:42:17 <Rusty> quoth the penguin
14:42:17 <Nude_Riker> then use linux i guess? the general public is a computing idiot
14:42:24 <mpg> actually install arch
14:42:33 <Selfie_Dad> if u really wanna navigate file paths and type commands
14:42:36 <mpg> arch is the elite linux now
14:42:37 <Selfie_Dad> gentoo is the ONE for you
14:42:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i would if i could game but i'd still probably need to use windows at least some of the time
14:42:39 <Selfie_Dad> yeah or arch
14:42:48 <Rusty> i installed arch on an old laptop RIGHT before they abandoned official 32bit support lol
14:42:59 <Selfie_Dad> i'm afraid you'll have to give up gaming 
14:43:10 <Rusty> this is nethack erasure
14:43:14 <Selfie_Dad> gaming doesn't jive with computational ethics
14:43:17 <Selfie_Dad> lol rusty
14:43:54 <Selfie_Dad> check out wine. i hear it supports upwards of a dozen computer games
14:44:00 <mpg> haha
14:44:00 <Nude_Riker> lol
14:44:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm being HARASSED online
14:44:12 <mpg> wine is actually like a Lot better than it used to be
14:44:15 <mpg> unironically
14:44:17 <Nude_Riker> i mean thanks to steam deck theres a lot more games that work on linux now right
14:44:30 <Selfie_Dad> alternately you could play that game where tux slides down a mountain or w/e
14:44:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i am not paying 800 dollars for a steam deck lol
14:44:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
14:44:53 <Nude_Riker> i mean they work on regular linux because steam forced adoption
14:44:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> playing elden ring on the switch
14:44:56 <Rusty> dutty WINE
14:45:20 <mpg> at the end of the day, there's not a single thing that will make everyone happy
14:45:30 <mpg> so adaptation is the true path, forever, eternally
14:45:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you nkow what would make me happy? being left alone to use the computer how i want
14:45:48 <mpg> as you wish
14:45:58 <Nude_Riker> being left alone to computer is humanity's greatest desire
14:46:02 <Rusty> i'm fixing to get an old Amiga and just disappear into learning 68k assembly
14:46:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> make some jungle tracks on it
14:46:16 <Rusty> also that obvi
14:46:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hell yeah
14:46:21 <Rusty> trackers ftw
14:46:23 <Nude_Riker> i would like to compute a thing at work but the vendor broke our authentication and still hasnt fixed it
14:46:30 <Nude_Riker> dumbasses
14:46:32 <mpg> its funny how popular retro computing has become
14:46:38 <mpg> total reaction
14:46:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l
14:46:46 <Nude_Riker> i have to have this thing configured asap but i literally cant do it
14:46:48 <Rusty> i mostly wanna cobble together a period accutate fansubbing setup
14:46:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao hell yeah that kicks ass
14:47:34 <Selfie_Dad> i love to compute
14:48:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> missed seeing this band on friday because i was too depressed to leave house
14:49:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> last week was really bad
14:49:16 <Rusty> sorry to hear that
14:49:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> feeling good this week though
14:49:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> its ok
14:49:42 <Selfie_Dad> pom poko is good
14:49:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> i was having a very hard time adapting to diet regimen
14:49:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> yes they are
14:49:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> the movie is also good
14:50:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> i watched that on andreys rec once
14:50:29 <Rusty> i gotta revisit that one, i only saw it as a bootleg in like 2004 and the translation was not the best
14:50:39 <Selfie_Dad> ive only seen it once on tcm
14:51:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> i got really into ghibli stuff in 2012 when i downloaded every miyazaki feature to my laptop in anticipation of not having power/internet during hurricane sandy
14:51:41 <Rusty> the otaku prepper
14:51:54 <Nude_Riker> lol
14:51:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> something that is striking me right now in saying this
14:52:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i saw my neighbor totoro and princess mononoke in the 90s
14:52:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the old dub
14:52:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> is that back in 2012 i could count on my laptop to hold a charge for several days through watching movies
14:52:13 <Rusty> .g can you eat expired pocky
14:52:20 <Rusty> lol
14:52:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> remember when macbooks had good battery life. crazy
14:52:58 <het> they do?
14:53:30 <het> like the battery life on the M1s is supposed to be really good
14:53:36 <het> (and seems to be in practice)
14:53:42 <Selfie_Dad> yeah it lasts well over 12 hrs
14:53:48 <Selfie_Dad> hell my old one reliably gets like 8
14:54:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> eh i guess maybe new ones. i still think of mine as being 'new' but i guess its actually like 6-7 years old now
14:54:15 <Selfie_Dad> yeah mines 7 years old
14:54:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> mine definitely does not get 12 hours if im watching video
14:54:45 <Selfie_Dad> no nor would mine
14:54:51 <Selfie_Dad> but i dont think they ever got that much 
14:54:59 <Selfie_Dad> maybe the airs did
14:55:02 <Nude_Riker> 12 hours of battery life if you turn the screen off and do nothing with it
14:55:02 <Selfie_Dad> not the pros though
14:55:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> my 2008 mbp did when it was 4 years old in 2012
14:55:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> it had insane battery life idk
14:55:23 <Selfie_Dad> but i can do like a solid 6-7 hours of work on mine before its yelling at me
14:56:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> i didnt have power for 3 whole days and i managed to keep the thing on for most of that time, while watching movies
14:56:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> i guess not having internet might have helped that as vlc was the only thing i was running but still
14:56:43 <Selfie_Dad> thats pretty good, i dont ever remember any of the macbooks being rated for over 10 hrs of battery life
14:56:48 <Selfie_Dad> except for maybe the airs
14:56:53 <Selfie_Dad> but they were slow as shit back then
14:56:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> that thing was a tank
14:57:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah it wasnt fast
14:57:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> that is for sure
14:57:27 <Selfie_Dad> i always basically just assumed you should be happy to get 8 hrs of screen on use
14:57:45 <Selfie_Dad> but the newer m1 books its more like 12-13
14:58:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> lmao https://twitter.com/JoshuaPotash/status/1503366303964348420
14:58:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> tesla owners are fucking deranged
14:59:56 <Selfie_Dad> lmao
15:00:07 <Selfie_Dad> Pretty cool how they can take your car very easily.
15:00:10 <Selfie_Dad> And you have no recourse!
15:00:20 <Selfie_Dad> Awesome!
15:00:32 <Nude_Riker> once self driving clears legally itll just leave with your stuff in it!
15:00:42 <Nude_Riker> maybe your baby!
15:01:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah lol
15:01:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/JaneOst_/status/1503383436458930178
15:01:53 <Selfie_Dad> yeah cant wait for the truly horrifying story when that actually happens
15:02:08 <Selfie_Dad> now im imaginging this being the catalyst for a baby's day out reboot movie
15:03:17 <Rusty> lol
15:03:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> the one person i know irl who owns a tesla definitely has funko pops so this tracks
15:04:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> (this is the guy who bought a black lotus with his first bonus when he started working for a hedge fund)
15:04:47 <Selfie_Dad> lol\
15:04:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> funky pops
15:05:08 <Rusty> woof
15:05:31 <Nude_Riker> the person i know who has a tesla is my landlord
15:05:41 <Nude_Riker> which, fitting
15:05:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have to thank him though because i got one of the hardest LL questions this season thanks to knowing him (his last name is Gupta)
15:05:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't know anyone who owns a tesla
15:06:00 <Rusty> .y tesla signs 1990
15:06:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
15:06:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> the band tesla, on a like pop-up video or something, was the reason i first ever heard of the person nikola tesla
15:06:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> when i was like 8
15:06:55 <Rusty> oh same
15:07:12 <Rusty> and then the Things You Never Knew Existed catalog always had some books about him in there
15:08:26 <Selfie_Dad> .l
15:08:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> actually i seem to recall at some point in the 90s tesla were playing in connecticut and the radio station my dad always listened to (99.1 WPLR, connecticut's #1 classic rock station) were doing a ticket giveaway and you had to answer what their name came from in order to win the tickets
15:08:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> thats probably when i learned it
15:08:39 <Selfie_Dad> the person i know who has a tesla is my next door neighbor
15:08:47 <Selfie_Dad> because hes a radiologist
15:08:49 <Selfie_Dad> so also fitting
15:09:57 <Nude_Riker> my adderall is ready for pickup, nice. need to call the clinic and schedule my next visit though, theyve forgotten to call me to schedule the last two times in a row
15:10:21 <Nude_Riker> and for some reason sent me the new patient intake forms again?
15:10:37 <Selfie_Dad> lol
15:10:42 <Homie_in_a_geod> do they have capsule in baltimore
15:10:54 <Nude_Riker> idk what that is
15:10:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> its a delivery pharmacy
15:11:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> in new york at least you can name capsule as your pharmacy and they will deliver you your prescriptions
15:11:27 <Nude_Riker> the pharmacy i go to is 2 blocks away so delivery would not really be a value add for me
15:11:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> fair enough
15:11:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> theres no pharmacy really that close to my apartment
15:12:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> i used to just get my shit ordered to whichever duane reade/cvs was closest to my work but, i dont work in an office anymore
15:12:15 <Nude_Riker> yeah home delivery of prescriptions is important overall, just not for me personally
15:12:36 <Nude_Riker> i remember when the usps delays were first starting to add up it really fucked over a lot of homebound people with rx needs
15:12:55 <Nude_Riker> cause their mail is all super low tier compared to even junk mail
15:15:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> that sucks
15:15:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> capsule is all individual couriers and you set your delivery times
15:15:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> its very convenient
15:15:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my friend's prescriptions were lost in the mail multiple times during all those delays
15:16:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> you also dont have to pay anything for the service. not really sure how the business model works and how they pay their couriers but it seems to be doing fine
15:16:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i felt really bad for her because she was trying to ration both adderall and ssris by not taking them every day
15:16:27 <Nude_Riker> yeah it was mostly for medicaid patients i think
15:16:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> that sucks
15:16:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> you really cant ration ssris that way
15:16:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah, she had a rough time for a few months
15:16:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> adderall you can but not necessarily advisable
15:16:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont take adderall on the weekends usually
15:16:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i should tell her about capsule
15:17:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah especially if shes in nyc
15:17:08 <Nude_Riker> yeah i mean its just as needed, ssris though, yikes
15:17:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> she lives in brooklyn
15:17:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh yeah definitely available to her then
15:17:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> its really good, i always thought it was probably some bullshit until my psychiatrist recommended it to me
15:17:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> they had subway ads for a long time
15:17:44 <Nude_Riker> when i had issues with filling ssri scrips i would take half doses rather than skip days
15:18:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> damn scott hall is going to die :(

15:34:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> The wreck of the Endurance (pictured), the ship sunk during Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, is found.
15:34:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> cool
15:34:32 <Selfie_Dad> cool
15:34:33 <Rusty> i read that as the wreck of the Eurodance
15:34:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
15:34:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> the wreck of the Vengabus
15:35:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
15:35:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> Mensun Bound, director of exploration on the expedition, said that Worsley's navigational skills had helped the expedition find the wreck: his historic "detailed records were invaluable".[79] Additionally, sea ice, which covers the Weddell Sea year-round and usually makes underwater exploration nearly impossible due to its thickness, was recorded as being at the lowest levels around Antarctica since space satellite 
15:35:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> records began in the 1970s.[80]
15:35:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh. good

15:44:26 <bonegar> dying Gay
15:44:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> they were stuck in antarctica for like 3 years. they all definitely fucked
15:45:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> maybe they didn't
15:45:13 <shrimp1989dspinfo> who are we to assume
15:45:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> im confident that they did.
15:45:22 <Nude_Riker> too cold for fuckin
15:45:26 <bonegar> the one guy who refuses to fuck, absolute ice princess
15:45:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> fuckin makes you warm
15:45:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no one had sex in the thing
15:45:36 <Nude_Riker> it wastes calories
15:45:47 <bonegar> the thing was having sex w/ everyone
15:45:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't think that was sex
15:45:57 <Nude_Riker> no one wanted to eat those penguins, they tasted terrible
15:46:35 <bonegar> morons cant even cook penguin right
15:46:47 <Nude_Riker> i wonder what triggers the walgreens system to text me but then the call is later
15:47:00 <Nude_Riker> is it a manual trigger, an intentional delay or something else
15:47:40 <bonegar> i bet you could render out a ton of penguin oil from a penguin and ...i guess dip biscuits in it
15:48:00 <Nude_Riker> yeah the thing i remember is everyone was like god this is so oily its terrible
15:48:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i don't want to think about cooking penguins
15:48:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they're friends
15:48:30 <Nude_Riker> well, dont get stranded in Antarctica is my advice
15:48:31 <bonegar> so are cows... chickens and pigs idk
15:48:33 <Selfie_Dad> i dunno matt it does the same thing to me
15:48:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> sometimes i think about how people used to make chapstick from seal fat way up north
15:48:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i read it in a book when i was a kid and it has stuck with me forever
15:49:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> just smearing seal fat on the lips
15:49:02 <bonegar> makes sense to me
15:49:04 <Nude_Riker> i got a new lip balm thats really good
15:49:12 <Nude_Riker> blistex lip infusions: hydrate
15:49:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> this guys cool
15:49:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perce_Blackborow
15:49:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i bought a couple tubes of chapstick a few years back and i'm finally running out
15:49:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but i think this flavor is discontinued so idk what to do
15:49:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> sneaking onto a boat going to antarctica lol
15:50:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> nvm it's not discontinued
15:50:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> thank god
15:50:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> remember the dr pepper chapstick that used to exist
15:50:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> that was good shit
15:51:17 <Nude_Riker> i do not remember that, disturbing idea
15:51:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> it appears it actually does still exist
15:51:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> badass
15:51:26 <bonegar> maybe this is shameful but i kinda just put my daily face moisturizer on my lips instead of applying balms lately
15:51:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.amazon.com/Lip-Smacker-Balm-Pepper-Ounce/dp/B077X6ZYF8

15:52:33 <bonegar> i'm definitely only doing a half-measure
15:52:52 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm a little freak and i apply chapstick every 20 min
15:52:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if i think about my lips i have to put some on
15:53:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if i don't put any on before i go to bed i can't sleep
15:54:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> i had to use some chapstick when we went skiing 
15:54:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> i guess i actually still have a small bit of chapping from that
15:54:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> i got two fists for two lips

17:11:52 <antiracist_baby> spiritual journey woman
17:12:11 <Disco_Pope> trying to think about the goofy part of the south korean election because the actual result is too terrible https://www.wsj.com/articles/these-campaigns-hope-deepfake-candidates-help-get-out-the-vote-11646756345
17:12:22 <antiracist_baby> the fact that it’s not written journeywoman makes that read very funny
17:12:41 <Disco_Pope> “My personality type is ENFJ, the same as Barack Obama,” AI Yoon responds, referring to a personality type common among outgoing, warm leaders. “Have an energetic day, Barack Obama!”
17:12:41 <antiracist_baby> did the nazis win
17:12:57 <Disco_Pope> yeah, basically, in my understanding
17:12:59 <spiritual_journey_woman> lol
17:13:25 <Disco_Pope> the president showed off his grocery purchases which are code for exterminating communists or something
17:13:29 <spiritual_journey_woman> when they drop out the 'magic magic mushroom' in the refrain to bring in a child's audience to participate is so sick
17:13:40 <antiracist_baby> at least japan i gerrymandered such that the conservative party has a perma majority
17:13:44 <antiracist_baby> and not the far right
17:14:12 <Disco_Pope> i dont really understand the real estate dimension of the election but i understand that was also important somehow
17:14:32 <Disco_Pope> i dont know south korean politics really
17:15:07 <NORG> cant be worse than the shadow shaman president can it
17:15:12 <NORG> well i suppose it can
17:15:51 <spiritual_journey_woman> i dont know what the cult shaman leader thing was about

17:34:18 <Melber> i dont really understand why that's THAT much worse than what was happening immediately before shrimp1989dspinfo 
17:34:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> because it was high
17:34:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he went for the head, that's a big big big problem
17:34:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> players can shove each other around a little but if you go for the head you're in trouble
17:35:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> crosschecking someone in the head/neck is really dangerous
17:36:35 <Disco_Pope> oh yeah thats clear on the replay
17:36:41 <Disco_Pope> right at the head
17:37:20 <dreddybajs> greeting
17:37:30 <spiritual_journey_woman> i thought you weren't allowed to lift your hockey stick up past your waist
17:37:34 <spiritual_journey_woman> is that just some made up thing
17:37:49 <Selfie_Dad> dick it all
17:38:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's called high sticking yeah
17:38:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's during plays
17:38:29 <spiritual_journey_woman> should be all the time they are on the ice imo
17:38:35 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's above shoulder level thoguh
17:38:38 <shrimp1989dspinfo> not waist
17:38:42 <spiritual_journey_woman> oh lol
17:38:47 <Disco_Pope> would be really funny if it was waist
17:38:47 <spiritual_journey_woman> so you can just start weildin'
17:38:54 <spiritual_journey_woman> i think it should be waist
17:38:58 <Disco_Pope> having to stay hunched over all the time
17:39:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
17:39:07 <spiritual_journey_woman> i literally thought this for some reason
17:39:11 <spiritual_journey_woman> maybe they do that for children? idk
17:39:59 <dreddybajs> i think that's in field hockey maybe
17:40:06 <dreddybajs> that rings a bell
17:40:32 <Disco_Pope> no slapshots in field hockey
17:41:00 <Selfie_Dad> what about slap chops
17:41:19 <Selfie_Dad> people who leave messages right next to sites of grace should be killed
17:41:21 <alansmithee_> what about slap bass? 
17:41:46 <alansmithee_> Selfie_Dad: there's a fight where you have to activate these things and poeple put a bunch of messages there and yeah, i agree
17:41:58 <spiritual_journey_woman> yea it's annoying when you need to do something and you're kind of suck in the message prompt menu 
17:42:27 <spiritual_journey_woman> sometimes it happens in dungeons and i need to switch out my shield and there's just some dumbass message in the way
17:42:34 <ajj3> yeah lol
17:42:51 <spiritual_journey_woman> i almost never read the messages, it's just kinda usless graffiti or a way to mark some pathing
17:43:04 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i wish you could turn them off
17:43:11 <Selfie_Dad> or if u marked them poor theyd go away forever
17:43:32 <dreddybajs> you can play in offline mode to turn em off
17:43:40 <Selfie_Dad> yeah thatd annoying
17:43:44 <spiritual_journey_woman> yeah, i dunno if you play offline you might not see them or fill in a your group passwords maybe 
17:43:48 <spiritual_journey_woman> havent tried it
17:43:51 <spiritual_journey_woman> i msotly just ignore them
17:43:54 <ajj3> lol dreddybajs i had to do that in the radhan fight
17:44:04 <ajj3> cause some jackoffs put messages over EVERY summon sign
17:45:05 <spiritual_journey_woman> it's one of those game mechanics that's a cute idea but really only serves the most annoying people
17:45:28 <eric> its handy to know when Beware of Left
17:45:34 <ajj3> lol
17:45:48 <spiritual_journey_woman> if people used it right it'd probably add to the overall experience, and maybe once or twice they've been actually helpful
17:45:53 <Selfie_Dad> also good to know good job!
17:46:03 <dreddybajs> vaati made a group pw called Seekers
17:46:06 <ajj3> frankly i find the bloodstains way more useful information

17:46:10 <dreddybajs> that i think has more useful messages
17:46:10 <spiritual_journey_woman> yea

17:47:41 <Selfie_Dad> ani dispanko
17:48:27 <spiritual_journey_woman> im kinda stuck between exploring Atlas Plateau and Nokron and making no progress
17:48:44 <spiritual_journey_woman> i probably need to grind out 10 levels 
17:48:45 <dreddybajs> ani difranco ftw
17:49:13 <spiritual_journey_woman> i should go back and help with earlier bosses and eat a bunch of golden chicken feet before fights
17:49:33 <ajj3> vigor matters so much more in this game than other ones
17:49:38 <Rusty> there's always Ani CDs in the $1 bins at record stores/goodwills and i feel a small sadness about that
17:49:39 <Selfie_Dad> im stuck between. margit
17:49:50 <Selfie_Dad> and continuing in the game
17:50:00 <eric> summon a homie
17:50:03 <spiritual_journey_woman> yea my vig is probably below average
17:50:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> huge news everyone

17:50:08 <eric> wow

17:50:11 <dreddybajs> oh hgell yes
17:50:15 <dreddybajs> did he trade 4 bongs for it
17:50:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
17:50:21 <Rusty> oooooh
17:50:23 <Selfie_Dad> i dont have a homie
17:50:24 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he said he got it from walmart finally
17:50:28 <shrimp1989dspinfo> summon alansmithee_
17:50:29 <dreddybajs> spiritual_journey_woman: do you have the gold scarab talisman, it gets you extra souls
17:50:31 <Selfie_Dad> oh i guess i have a mason homie now
17:50:35 <eric> you can just summon some rando
17:50:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you can summon mason when he's there
17:50:36 <spiritual_journey_woman> congratulations to the poster mason for being freed from Bitch Jail
17:50:46 <Rusty> Summon Mason
17:50:58 <Selfie_Dad> try rolling
17:51:02 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ^
17:52:48 <alansmithee_> Selfie_Dad: yeah you can summon me. i'm not great but i'm around lvl 85 or so. kinda slowed down a bit this weekend cause was busy
17:53:15 <Selfie_Dad> im grinding some levels now
17:53:17 <Rusty> Keep Summoning I'm Reloading
17:53:38 <Selfie_Dad> i did realize that summoning the bitchass npc guy at the beginning of the fight makes margit way harde
17:53:39 <Selfie_Dad> r
17:53:39 <Selfie_Dad> lol
17:53:55 <Selfie_Dad> cause he dies so early and then you're stuck w/ him hitting harder and having more hp
17:54:14 <Selfie_Dad> so i got him to like... 40% last night before i got sick of it
17:55:26 <dreddybajs> do they hit harder too? i thought it was just the hp boost
17:55:40 <Selfie_Dad> seems like it
17:55:41 <Rusty> i think im gonna try bloodborne in earnest this week, since it's free, as opposed to blindly buying elden ring to feel a part of something
17:56:10 <eric> bloodborn e good game
17:56:28 <eric> did u play many other from games rusty
17:59:51 <antiracist_baby> theyre good games to play when everyone else is playing them
18:00:13 <dreddybajs> yeah definitely antiracist_baby 
18:00:24 <dreddybajs> i loved ds3 but it was a bummer playing through solo and in offline mode cause servers were down
18:00:35 <dreddybajs> elden is a lot more fun w/ everyone exploring at once
18:02:01 <ajj3> bloodborne is extremely epic rusty
18:03:25 <eric> my fingers hurt
18:03:59 <Selfie_Dad> .gis be gay
18:04:25 <eric> honk
18:04:27 <antiracist_baby> oh hey they made it so windows 11 displays the clock on the taskbar that is not on the primary monitor
18:04:30 <antiracist_baby> idk how it shipped without that
18:04:50 <eric> did they make it so it can display the whole date without having the thick bar
18:04:55 <eric> i would up[grade if so
18:04:58 <antiracist_baby> whats the thick bar
18:05:05 <eric> like big icons or wahtever
18:05:11 <antiracist_baby> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/xFkdvEvl/image.png
18:05:12 <antiracist_baby> mine looks like this
18:05:16 <eric> what to heck
18:06:54 <Selfie_Dad> bad
18:06:59 <Selfie_Dad> i hate it
18:07:09 <dreddybajs> thicc bar benji
18:07:22 <eric> oh yeah that is thick
18:07:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> trog
18:07:39 <antiracist_baby> idk what the small one looks like
18:07:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l
18:07:57 <antiracist_baby> khia
18:08:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> this is off to a good start
18:08:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> there are riffs
18:08:25 <eric> Rajesh Govind, your suggestion of using larger tray icons to make the taskbar wider helped me to figure out how to fix this.  I went to taskbar properties, unchecked the “Lock the taskbar”.  Grab the edge of taskbar with mouse and pulled it wider by two millimeters and the date appeared.  I went back to taskbar properties, checked the “Lock the taskbar”.  Done.  Problem solved.
18:08:33 <eric> do that but the opposite to see for yourself
18:08:37 <Selfie_Dad> khemmis ftw
18:08:44 <eric> theres no space above and below the icons
18:08:58 <antiracist_baby> i dont think thats an option in windows 11 lol
18:09:00 <eric> ir kess
18:09:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> woot my cards came in for my new mtg deck
18:09:03 <eric> or less
18:09:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> also some cards i got just because i wanted them
18:09:16 <Selfie_Dad> cords
18:09:21 <antiracist_baby> any smaller a taskbar would be too small with this size of monitor anyway
18:09:32 <eric> yeah i can see that
18:09:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> you want to see a card you will appreciate, just for its name Selfie_Dad 
18:09:39 <Selfie_Dad> new drug chuch is good
18:09:50 <Selfie_Dad> sure
18:09:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/4cOEc08M/1647281396.JPG

18:10:16 <eric> nice tube of cream
18:10:21 <antiracist_baby> isnt that term copyright of dnd
18:10:24 <antiracist_baby> oh wait wizards owns dnd now

18:10:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah
18:10:26 <dreddybajs> yea
18:10:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> and this was a d&d set
18:10:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> eric: its glue
18:10:40 <eric> dnd owns lich
18:10:42 <dreddybajs> theyre also doing a lotr set next
18:10:42 <Selfie_Dad> glue probably
18:10:43 <eric> ?
18:10:43 <Selfie_Dad> yeah
18:10:50 <eric> glue
18:10:59 <antiracist_baby> demilich specifically
18:11:02 <Selfie_Dad> dj glue
18:11:03 <eric> oh 
18:11:05 <eric> thats stupid
18:11:11 <eric> its tape
18:11:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> the next set is art deco themed
18:11:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> seems cool so far but they might do stupid crap
18:11:45 <dreddybajs> art deco lotr set
18:11:54 <antiracist_baby> its funny that tsr threatened to sue square for all the d&d stuff in final fantasy 1 and they just changed the names but kept the likenesses and that was apparently enough to get them off their backs
18:11:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> the lands look cool at least
18:11:59 <eric> .gis the goofiest motherfuckin magic card
18:12:04 <antiracist_baby> so there's mindflayers but they are just called wizards
18:12:15 <antiracist_baby> and sahaguin but they are called sahagin
18:12:19 <antiracist_baby> idk how they got away with that one
18:12:38 <antiracist_baby> the yare still in the modern games too
18:12:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://cardgamebase.com/new-capenna-basic-lands/
18:12:45 <antiracist_baby> .gis final fantasy 1 wizard
18:12:51 <antiracist_baby> die wizmp
18:12:52 <antiracist_baby> .gis final fantasy 1 wizard
18:12:57 <antiracist_baby> no
18:12:58 <antiracist_baby> .gis final fantasy 1 wizard
18:12:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> the mountains and plains are the best of these imo
18:13:04 <antiracist_baby> bastard
18:13:15 <eric> i like the swamp
18:13:17 <eric> as usual
18:13:17 <antiracist_baby> https://d1ryv5bogsxua4.cloudfront.net/images/ff/sharing/monsters/wizard.png
18:13:36 <antiracist_baby> u live ni one
18:13:47 <eric> bog dweller
18:13:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> you live in the toilet
18:14:04 <antiracist_baby> whats the lore theme of the art deco set
18:14:05 <antiracist_baby> is it bioshock
18:14:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> its not bioshock but... idk theyre probably gonna do it a lot like bioshock
18:14:50 <Selfie_Dad> how about guyoshock
18:15:00 <antiracist_baby> all the crossover stuff is very corny
18:15:05 <antiracist_baby> didnt they make street fighter cards
18:15:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> so here’s this giant enemy crab https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/jHB0AFkz/1647281701.JPG
18:15:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah they made street fighter cards
18:15:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> which, they will later be releasing as non-street fighter cards
18:15:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> which is their crossover IP Thing now
18:15:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> that everything needs to be released as a regular magic card too
18:16:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> because their walking dead cards made people mad
18:16:12 <eric> .gis chun li magic card
18:16:27 <eric> .gis chun li countless kicks
18:16:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> i bought the street fighter cards because i think theyre going to get jacked up in price lol
18:16:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> i will sell them probably
18:16:53 <Selfie_Dad> i feel like you should get more than one point of stamina per endurance lvl
18:16:54 <Selfie_Dad> seems low
18:17:11 <eric> x is the number of times chun-li was kicked
18:17:14 <Selfie_Dad> lol
18:17:22 <eric> multikicker class
18:17:33 <Selfie_Dad> .l
18:17:36 -!- letty [~letty@synIRC-77688CA5.dyn.plus.net] has joined #phiz
18:17:45 <antiracist_baby> lol that the chun li card is a goofy pun also
18:17:45 <dreddybajs> Selfie_Dad: i think it goes 1-2-1-2
18:17:51 <dreddybajs> up to a certain point
18:18:06 <Selfie_Dad> fail
18:18:21 <dreddybajs> u can get talismans to help too which is nice
18:18:33 <antiracist_baby> https://twitter.com/lazerwalker/status/1502654626654531589
18:18:34 <antiracist_baby> lol
18:18:41 <dreddybajs> im wearing 3 +stamina talismans rn
18:18:53 <alansmithee_> the +stat talismans are pretty good too
18:19:23 <scoop_jackson> https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/ : Friend hasn't been talking to me because I agreed with a Fantano review
18:19:33 <eric> thats cool benji
18:19:47 <eric> i bet it doesnt work well in a complicated scene though
18:19:56 <Rusty> i have played zero fromsoft games so far
18:20:02 <alansmithee_> what fantano review? 
18:20:23 <dreddybajs> its very stupid that the map has a button to remove all markers, the ones you probably want there permanently, but not all beacons
18:20:24 <Rusty> i think i played a tiny bit of DS1 years ago but gave up immediately lol
18:20:28 <letty> lol, can we not agree with anthony fantanpo
18:20:31 <dreddybajs> which are annoying outside of the map and usually temporary
18:20:39 <eric> i think elden ring is probably the easiest one to get into
18:20:50 <eric> bloodborne is rather hard at first
18:21:06 <eric> at least to me, a noob
18:22:12 <Selfie_Dad> yeah im sure you can get a lot of cool items
18:22:15 <Selfie_Dad> if you can get past margit
18:22:18 <Selfie_Dad> which i cant yet lol
18:22:27 <Rusty> i'm gonna just give it the old college try, perhaps with a beer
18:22:33 <dreddybajs> i think 2 of the ones i used for most of the game for stamina u can get before margit
18:22:33 <Rusty> a nice college beer
18:22:37 <alansmithee_> lmk what time you wanna play Selfie_Dad and we'll wreck margit
18:22:48 <eric> good luck its a cool game 
18:22:53 <dreddybajs> oh theres a really good one in the town with the ghost boat boss Selfie_Dad 
18:22:56 <dreddybajs> if you found that area
18:23:01 <Selfie_Dad> ya i beat that guy
18:23:08 <Selfie_Dad> i might be able to do it in a lil bit alan
18:23:18 <dreddybajs> theres an imp statue you put a stonesword key into and theres a treasure chest below it Selfie_Dad 
18:23:23 <dreddybajs> that gives you a sick s tamina talisman
18:23:35 <alansmithee_> Selfie_Dad: would around 3 work maybe? if not that's cool too
18:23:40 <eric> stamina daddy
18:23:53 <ajj3> margit is extremely punishing 
18:23:55 <Selfie_Dad> like 3 est? cause yes. but if we're talking a diff time zone probably not lol
18:23:56 <alansmithee_> and i'm sad to admit that i've gone to the dark side, i'm running mimic over my jellyfish
18:24:06 <alansmithee_> Selfie_Dad: yeah i'm in est, the only true time zone
18:24:12 <dreddybajs> just lost 82k souls

18:24:52 <dreddybajs> Selfie_Dad: you get this from that ghost boat town drop, really good https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/AEckNXvz/image.png
18:24:57 <alansmithee_> i know some of the UP is also central but they're weird anyways
18:25:03 <Selfie_Dad> oh that seems very useful
18:25:08 <Selfie_Dad> maybe ill head up there and grab that
18:25:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i have that thing
18:25:14 <Selfie_Dad> i need a stoneswordkey i think though

18:25:38 <dreddybajs> they always lead to good shit
18:25:52 <eric> my friends advice to me was buy keys and spellbooks
18:26:00 <dreddybajs> yeah and the recipe books
18:26:07 <eric> i havent crafted a damn thing
18:26:08 <dreddybajs> they end up useful even if they dont seem so at first

18:26:15 <dreddybajs> i started crafting recently and i can make some GOod Shit now
18:26:19 <Selfie_Dad> ive only crated a few arrows

18:28:51 <Selfie_Dad> .l

18:31:54 <het> Selfie_Dad: the thing is I took a LONG break before the final chapter of Y6
18:32:06 <het> like I put it down and didn't pick it back up for over a year
18:32:09 <Selfie_Dad> oh wow lol

18:33:10 <Selfie_Dad> i have acquired turtle pleasure
18:33:13 <Melber> Lol het
18:33:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> if only ernest tubbs record shop had done the same..

18:39:53 <Selfie_Dad> wheres a good place for smithin stones so i can make my whip slap harder
18:40:57 <dreddybajs> raya lucaria crystal mine on the northeast side of the big lake
18:41:15 <dreddybajs> its got those miner guys and if u beat it, u get the bell bearing that lets you buy unlimited 1 and 2 smithing stones in roundtable hold
18:41:47 <Selfie_Dad> hmm i guess i havent come across that place yet
18:41:52 <dreddybajs> https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map?id=1609&lat=-125.190625&lng=67.057347&zoom=8&code=mapA theres it on the map
18:42:12 <Selfie_Dad> ive only been in the crystal mine in caleid where i got owned by the bug guys
18:42:41 <Selfie_Dad> i gotta say, the location this place drops ur corpse when you die is a little confusing some times
18:42:41 <Selfie_Dad> gae*
18:42:42 <eric> thats after margit
18:43:35 <dreddybajs> oh sorry
18:43:42 <dreddybajs> you can get there beforehand but yea
18:43:45 <Selfie_Dad> oh yeah it looks like it is
18:43:47 <dreddybajs> youd have to go out of your way
18:44:09 <dreddybajs> and yeah Selfie_Dad it usually timetravels back a bit, and always tries to put it on a high place rather than a low place if u dropped down
18:44:20 <dreddybajs> so you dont lose runes if you fall off a cliff
18:44:38 <Selfie_Dad> i am a little made at how much this game gatekeeps from u w/ this one boss
18:44:40 <Selfie_Dad> but we
18:44:49 <dreddybajs> yeah its uhh definitely a design choice
18:45:02 <dreddybajs> even after beating ds3, it still took me like 2 hours to beat him i think
18:45:10 <dreddybajs> i went away and did a shitload of stuff and it still wasnt trivial
18:45:17 <eric> ive only tried him a couple times
18:45:33 <eric> i got pretty close on my first go though i wonder how ill do when i try again
18:45:49 <eric> ive got to explore the whole thing down here first though
18:46:40 <Selfie_Dad> i got him to like 40% but he hits so hard that eventually i lose my stam and he pwns em
18:46:41 <Selfie_Dad> me
18:50:24 <eric> goto get dodgy
18:51:21 <dreddybajs> Selfie_Dad: patches also sells an item that helps with Margit specifically

19:09:41 <scoop_jackson> When Titans Clashed: How the Red Army Stopped Hitler
19:20:40 <Rusty> Kotlin
19:35:50 <alansmithee_> oh shit scott hall is being taken off life support. i didn't even know he was that bad
19:40:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> alansmithee_: it was complications from hip surgery apparently
19:40:50 <alansmithee_> yeah i just read that. had a blood clot that caused a heart attack 
19:40:54 <Homie_in_a_geod> he had been in really bad shape a few years ago but he was sober and more recent interviews he looked/sounded good
19:41:07 <eric> bloodclot ting
19:41:35 <alansmithee_> yeah he hooked up with ddp and seemed to be turning things around
19:42:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> yup
19:42:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> he was the first resident of the DDP Accountability Crib
19:42:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> a phrase that will always be funny to me
19:42:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> i need to cut 4 cards from my grist edh deck
19:43:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/4666305#paper
19:44:14 <dreddybajs> link doesnt work
19:44:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> does for me
19:44:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> try again
19:44:52 <eric> The deck you are trying to view has been marked as private. If you are the deck owner, please login and try again.
19:44:57 <alansmithee_> yeah it's private
19:45:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> ok try again now
19:46:35 <eric> life from the loam
19:46:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> lantern seems kind of medium but it does help me do a patriarchs bidding without enabling someone else playing a tribal deck
19:46:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> loam ftw
19:46:50 <alansmithee_> winding way
19:47:06 <dreddybajs> moldervine reclamation seems very expensive for the effect
19:47:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> winding way seems way too good in this deck
19:47:18 <eric> i like cards what give you more land i think
19:47:26 <eric> its annoying to have a cool guy you cant summon
19:47:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> that is true
19:48:31 <alansmithee_> the problem i have with winding way is it seems way too low impact
19:49:09 <alansmithee_> lantern you already pointed out yourself is kinda meh
19:49:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> winding way and mulch are doing the same thing here (i will only ever pick land on winding way)
19:49:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> so i do have 2 of that effect
19:49:35 <Selfie_Dad> u wanna give that dickhead margit a try alan
19:49:41 <Selfie_Dad> i got a few min
19:49:48 <alansmithee_> yeah sure give me a sec
19:51:40 <alansmithee_> idk how to do this by the way so you gotta tell me
19:51:53 <Selfie_Dad> uh me neither
19:51:56 <Selfie_Dad> i guess i use a finger?
19:52:06 <Homie_in_a_geod> (but hole)
19:52:10 <alansmithee_> carion grub is kinda medium Homie_in_a_geod . i know it mills but still
19:52:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> HellaBead i'm making oatmeal raisin cookies and chocolate cookies filled with pb
19:52:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> most of the insects are pretty medium but the idea is being able to stack them all up for huge grist activations
19:52:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> HellaBrad
19:52:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oops
19:52:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hella bead
19:54:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> i feel like i can probably drop 1 land with all the accel
19:54:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> 37 + 2 mdfc feels like a lot
19:54:30 <alansmithee_> yeah that's fair
19:55:02 <alansmithee_> you also have a couple spell lands too 
19:55:06 <Selfie_Dad> oh i guess u gotta go to the grace near margit alan
19:55:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah thats what i mean by mdfc
19:55:11 <Selfie_Dad> the castleward one
19:55:20 <alansmithee_> kk
19:55:44 <Selfie_Dad> and then use the furlcalling finger remedy thing i think
19:56:23 <alansmithee_> i used one
19:56:44 <Selfie_Dad> there should be uh, one for Dog
19:56:48 <Selfie_Dad> which is my char i guess
19:57:11 <Selfie_Dad> right near the grace
19:57:22 <Selfie_Dad> in gold i guess
19:58:23 <alansmithee_> ugh all i see is bloodstains and messages
19:58:30 <alansmithee_> i'm right on the summon thing
19:58:37 <alansmithee_> or the grace
19:59:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> well im short a beast within and a gravepurge so i guess ill play the deck a little and see what i feel i need the least
19:59:26 <dreddybajs> you should should both have the eldphiz pass set
19:59:29 <dreddybajs> in multiplayer options menu
20:00:00 <NORG> https://twitter.com/nbcchicago/status/1503454146472865792

20:01:45 <alansmithee_> idk, i don't think so tho
20:01:49 <dreddybajs> you get some loot tho
20:02:10 <Selfie_Dad> i just set eldphiz
20:02:37 <dreddybajs> set it for both group and mp, idr which is which
20:02:40 <dreddybajs> for summons
20:02:42 <dreddybajs> probably mp
20:03:08 <Selfie_Dad> ok summon sign set right outside the grace
20:03:39 <alansmithee_> castleward tunnel right? 
20:03:49 <Selfie_Dad> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ygPcO7mU/1647288226.JPG
20:05:28 <alansmithee_> ok see if you can summon me
20:05:30 <Selfie_Dad> do you not see it or do you see a fuckload of em
20:05:32 <alansmithee_> i put my sign there
20:05:32 <HellaBrad> shrimp1989dspinfo sounds good! i love cookies with peanut butter in them, i am growing to enjoy oats more
20:05:47 <dreddybajs> one of you puts the summon sign down, not both of you
20:05:53 <Selfie_Dad> yeah i put it down
20:06:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> how do you not like oats....
20:06:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> make oatmeal raisin cookies
20:06:10 <Selfie_Dad> use the other finger, the finger remedy
20:06:17 <Selfie_Dad> to see mind
20:06:33 <alansmithee_> i'm not seeing it
20:06:44 <HellaBrad> oats are just a boring kind of breakfast! they aren't a cookie ingredient
20:06:47 <Selfie_Dad> why did they have to make this as obnoxious as possible
20:06:53 <HellaBrad> but like i said i am evolving beyond this position
20:06:54 <eric> aare we having a nice user experience lads
20:07:02 <dreddybajs> it worked first time for us pc gamers >:)
20:07:14 <NORG> scroats
20:07:34 <dreddybajs> Selfie_Dad: alansmithee_ has to be the one to put the summon sign down, then you summon him to your world
20:07:42 <NORG> i dont know what game to play next
20:07:42 <dreddybajs> if you put it down, you'll be summoned to his and not be the main player to beat the boss
20:07:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> make sure mp is on
20:07:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> if this was not already mentioned
20:07:53 <alansmithee_> ok i put my sign down
20:07:55 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you have to set everything to enabled
20:08:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> dreddybajs it only worked the first time for us because i went through all this with bonegar
20:08:25 <dreddybajs> oh yeah
20:08:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it took a minute for me to figure it out
20:08:32 <Selfie_Dad> wats ur char name
20:08:40 <alansmithee_> smithson
20:08:40 <dreddybajs> Settings -> Network -> Send Summon Sign -> Enable
20:08:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> NORG play rune factory 5, coming out 3/22 for the nintendo switch

20:09:25 <Selfie_Dad> but none of em are yours
20:09:34 <Selfie_Dad> and when i put the network pass on i dont see anything
20:09:37 <dreddybajs> you should only see alansmithee_'s if you set the password
20:09:46 <dreddybajs> make sure both of your pws are the same
20:09:56 <alansmithee_> eldphiz is mine all lowercase

20:10:11 <alansmithee_> yeah i have both set

20:13:26 <eric> good work
20:13:59 <dreddybajs> damn first try
20:14:01 <dreddybajs> lets go
20:16:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> i baked, you a pie
20:17:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> epic
20:17:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> grats gamers
20:18:03 <eric> one of our d&d guys never shows up and then acts like we havent just been doing it weekly unless otherwise stated for months
20:18:09 <bonegar> my friend made a pie today and texted me about it and i didnt even make fun of it once
20:18:25 <eric> hes going off on group chat as we speak
20:18:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> why
20:18:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's rude
20:18:40 <eric> idk 
20:18:40 <bonegar> lol eric
20:18:42 <bonegar> d&d gus
20:18:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> also bonegar did the pie look tasty
20:18:44 <bonegar> guys
20:18:46 <eric> people be like that
20:18:53 <bonegar> i'm not a good judge
20:19:01 <bonegar> it was like some kind of chocolate pie but with cinnamon
20:19:14 <bonegar> so mostly like cream stuff i mean looked totally fine
20:19:23 <bonegar> just making a pie on pi day or whatever and i am not even rolling my eyes
20:19:29 <bonegar> just trying to be nice
20:19:42 <eric> i forgot it was pi day
20:20:29 <Selfie_Dad> ooh hook claws
20:20:31 <Selfie_Dad> are those any good
20:21:15 <ajj3> the claws do crazy bleed damage i think
20:21:22 <ajj3> bleed is rly good against some bosses
20:21:22 <dreddybajs> yeah theyre cool
20:21:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh it's pi day
20:21:30 <dreddybajs> i saw some speed runners were using them
20:21:32 <bonegar> seen a lot of people enjoy the claws 
20:21:44 <bonegar> also bleed is extremely powerful in general
20:22:25 <bonegar> i haven't used the claws yet because i haven't found a good fit to match it
20:23:51 <Selfie_Dad> seems like claw could be good in a dual wield sitch
20:24:32 <bonegar> def
20:24:36 <bonegar> i think you can put on two and go ham
20:25:08 <bonegar> i was running around punching rabbitaroos and low level guys and you can just absolutely go racking with r1 and l1 
20:26:10 <bonegar> the weapon builds are like an entire decade of development so there's just an insane amount of cool stuff you can do, i just kinda wish you weren't stuck to a single war art
20:26:29 <bonegar> i guess you could cycle weapons to get buffs for some of them
20:28:06 <mikev> lmao this review of the local wendys
20:28:07 <mikev> https://i.gyazo.com/10651060dff2946220b7daa7f2e3a4a0.png
20:28:44 <eric> is that the burger gkkinig
20:28:48 <eric> burger king
20:29:06 <dreddybajs> just lost 140k runes
20:29:09 <dreddybajs> and i DONT even CARE
20:29:58 <shrimp1989dspinfo> that's a good question
20:30:00 <shrimp1989dspinfo> how can that be?
20:30:07 <bonegar> i need runes
20:30:27 <bonegar> i guess you can't really farm helping people.. i did godrick once nad couldnt get summoned again after
20:30:31 <bonegar> maybe there is a timer
20:31:03 <scoop_jackson> lol eric regarding dnd
20:31:10 <dreddybajs> did you find windmill village yet bonegar 
20:31:15 <dreddybajs> i found that to be a very chill place to rune farm
20:31:18 <bonegar> yea
20:31:22 <bonegar> that place was so cool
20:31:28 <bonegar> lmao
20:31:34 <dreddybajs> just do the first 2 groups of ladies, teleport back to bonfire, rinse and repeat
20:31:42 <dreddybajs> gets you like 4k? runes and they can drop Golden Rune 3 as well
20:31:49 <dreddybajs> so i think it works out as like 5k every time
20:32:01 <bonegar> i dont like killing non-hostile guys 
20:32:18 <dreddybajs> hmm thats why i liked it, cause there was no chance theyd kill you again if you died once
20:32:19 <bonegar> i can see you enjoying that though
20:32:19 <dreddybajs> lol
20:32:32 <eric> lol
20:32:34 <dreddybajs> again with the pointless barb
20:32:36 <bonegar> yeah, this fits perfectly with my image of you
20:32:52 <dreddybajs> why are you like this, im just trying to help
20:32:53 <eric> love to repeatedly murder 2 groups of ladies for personal gain
20:33:12 <eric> to recieve a gold rune
20:33:27 <bonegar> over and over and over
20:33:30 <bonegar> so relaxing
20:33:31 <dreddybajs> they are wickerman style ladies that would hurt my friend nic cage
20:33:33 <bonegar> no personal issues at all
20:33:54 <bonegar> relating to nic cage in the wickerman 'he did nothing wrong'
20:33:56 <bonegar> lol
20:34:02 <dreddybajs> go off
20:34:08 <bonegar> they literally should ban you from buying shovels in your country
20:39:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i want to do the murder a woman to receive a gold rune quest
20:39:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i went to that village but i got nervous and just ran through
20:39:51 <bonegar> that village was cool as hell
20:40:05 <bonegar> the creepy fight with that skin peeler guy at the top
20:40:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i forgot i bought "pineberries" yesterday
20:40:48 <eric> .gis pineberry
20:40:54 <eric> oh yeah
20:40:56 <eric> cool

20:41:18 <bonegar> is.. ... is... that what they are?

20:41:40 <bonegar> oh a strawberry cultivar
20:41:44 <eric> ive never had one but theyre supposed to taste like pineabble or something
20:41:48 <bonegar> i guess strawberries are an insanely famous cultivar
20:42:03 <eric> we have wild strawberries grow in our back yard
20:42:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i bit into one and saw a baby spider
20:42:06 <eric> theyre so good
20:42:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm killing myself now
20:42:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> goodbyr

20:45:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> agy knows french
20:45:23 <eric> by standing right on top of it and bumping her head into my chest
20:45:30 <shrimp1989dspinfo> no they just taste like unripened strawberries

20:49:53 <ajj3> lol
20:54:50 <bonegar> i see a lot of websites now that let you just design memes within the website, and it's kinda easy to imagine an Elden Ring one that posts a 'steal this look' template but for elden ring gear, that would probably be very popular 
20:55:25 <eric> the words for cake and dotard in french are very similar
20:55:35 <eric> fortunately thats a hard one to mix up contextually
20:55:46 <bonegar> .gis dotard

21:48:05 <dreddybajs> very nice
21:50:38 <scoop_jackson> Do y’all use doubanjiang?
21:50:46 <scoop_jackson> (In general)
21:50:46 <eric> i have
21:50:53 <Disco_Pope> never ehard of it
21:50:56 <scoop_jackson> That’s wassup Eric
21:51:01 <dreddybajs> scoop_jackson: i prefer chogon
21:51:24 <eric> ive used it for dan dan noodle
21:51:44 <scoop_jackson> I don’t know what chogon is
21:51:52 <eric> wait mayube not dan dan now i must think
21:51:52 <dreddybajs> then how about you chogon deez nuts
21:51:56 <dreddybajs> lmao
21:51:57 <scoop_jackson> It’s the sauce in all the Szechuan dishes Disco_Pope
21:51:57 <Homie_in_a_geod> LMAO
21:52:00 <scoop_jackson> Lol
21:52:04 <eric> mapo tofu
21:52:12 <scoop_jackson> Hot pot
21:52:12 <Disco_Pope> nice, well, i dont really cook any chinese dishes at home
21:52:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> a moment of silence for scoop_jackson 
21:52:41 <Disco_Pope> would be nice to but i just keep making my own weird creations
21:52:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> chen kenichi uses doubanjiang in most of his stuff on iron chef
21:53:05 <scoop_jackson> It’s pretty versatile imo
21:53:09 <eric> yeah
21:53:27 <bonegar> .gis 辣豆瓣酱
21:53:40 <eric> tahts the stuff
21:54:01 <Disco_Pope> looks tasty
21:54:08 <eric> its also used in a lot of korean dishes
21:54:10 <eric> or the equivalent
21:54:13 <scoop_jackson> That’s a good brand too
21:54:16 <bonegar> mabodoofu staple
21:54:19 <eric> tteokbeokki or however its spelt
21:54:55 <eric> hmm i guess they jsut use gochujang in this recipe
21:54:59 <Selfie_Dad> xon
21:55:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> they out there in korea starting words with double consonants 🤦‍♂️
21:56:22 <bonegar> well there's no right spelling because you're just romanizing it
21:56:33 <bonegar> so frankly it's a free for all and you can just have fun
21:56:36 <eric> maybe what im thinking of is just a mix of gochujang and doenjang
21:56:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> i know that
21:57:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> its weird that the romanization system that somebody invented decided to do that though
21:57:34 <Selfie_Dad> broman
21:57:40 <bonegar> there are like multiple competing ones 
21:57:44 <eric> korean is a cool language
21:57:52 <eric> it sounds fun to speak
21:57:53 <bonegar> it causes my brain to melt
21:58:00 <bonegar> because it sounds like scrambled japanese to me
21:58:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> i onlt know a few words in korean
21:58:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> the main word that i know is Ajumma
21:58:30 <Selfie_Dad> .qs vagina
21:58:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> which is a respectful honorific for an old woman
21:58:38 <eric> its got a nice rhythm to it
21:58:47 <bonegar> lmao
21:59:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> there was a chinese guy i worked with at 7-eleven who was really jealous of all the old korean women who worked there because he thought korean sounded so cool
21:59:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> he would never shut up about how he wanted to learn korean because it sounded so cool but i dont think he ever actually learned any korean at all
21:59:31 <Disco_Pope> lol
21:59:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> he was really funny
21:59:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> he would always go in the bathroom and read cosmo for like, at least a half hour of his shift
21:59:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> "thats how you know what women are thinking"
22:00:02 <eric> nice
22:00:10 <eric> i love to read on the toilet at work frankly
22:00:39 <Disco_Pope> smart man
22:00:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> he would also drink orangina all the time but he pronounced it "orange gina" the second part sounding like the corresponding letters in vagina
22:00:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> he was not doing this as a joke and didnt understand why people thought it sounded funny
22:01:05 <eric> .g how is orangina pronounced
22:01:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> also he was a native english speaker
22:02:04 <Selfie_Dad> lmao

22:14:01 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/lhmBtc3l/firefox_3A58C4fyjC.mp4
22:14:18 <Disco_Pope> lmao what is this
22:14:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the first season was just some normal murder mystery but the second season is Incels And White Supremacists for some reason??? i don't care about this shit
22:14:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's called traces
22:14:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm laughing so hard at this scene
22:14:46 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's just lik eme (:
22:16:56 <ajj3> lmfao
22:16:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> in this scene he set up a fake date with a woman and called her a whore and a slut in his head and planted a bomb in the restaurant
22:17:05 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and he was like
22:17:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> laughing about how she'll never get with chad basically
22:17:14 <Disco_Pope> lmao
22:17:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> before he was calling every woman a whore he was rating women in his head
22:17:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and he rated a blonde woman a 10 and a black woman an 8
22:18:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> pretty curious he'd rank a black woman so highif he's allegedly a racist??
22:18:56 <ajj3> lmao that reminds me the latest season of bosch had a plot about Incels

22:20:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> idk why there are so many incel plotlines now
22:20:45 <shrimp1989dspinfo> svu did it first with that extremely epic supreme gentleman episode
22:21:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the guy they cast to play fake elliot rodger was in the scream tv series
22:21:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this show i'm watching is from the uk and every time they say incel someone else says "it's an american thing"
22:22:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they found a pill capsule colored black at one of the crime scenes
22:22:15 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and they spent like 15 minutes talking about blackpills
22:22:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> and explaining the refs

23:15:45 <dreddybajs> very nice eric
23:17:54 <alansmithee_> eric which one? 
23:19:52 <eric> in fact its not a real katana but a cross-naginata
23:19:55 <eric> more spear like
23:20:14 <eric> but it seems cool i need more strength
23:21:15 <eric> hmm theres a dragon down here
23:21:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you should slay the dragon
23:22:13 <eric> i think ill juice up my weeapons first and get a level
23:22:19 <alansmithee_> which dragon? 
23:22:31 <eric> near Rear Gael Tunnel Entrance
23:22:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> just ordered a bunch of chapstick
23:22:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> now i won't have to buy chapstick for many years
23:24:59 <Selfie_Dad> wat kind
23:25:11 <alansmithee_> eric is that the one in the hell area? cause yeah fuck that dragon lol that rot shit is annoying
23:25:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/Hs5SfeFe/image.png
23:25:27 <Selfie_Dad> holiday jumbo
23:25:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's big compared to the normal badger tube
23:25:59 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this is the only chapstick i've found that i don't have an allergic reaction to
23:27:41 <dreddybajs> badger tube
23:31:34 <Melber> Dang Scott hall is either dying or dead :(
23:32:57 <alansmithee_> yeah he had a heart attack from surgery complications over the weekend :/
23:35:18 <Melber> Apparently THREE hearts attacks
23:37:44 <alansmithee_> well yeah he no sold the first two obviously :(
23:38:37 <Disco_Pope> messed up my timezones twice in two emails scheduling a job interview, looking good for me
23:43:38 <Selfie_Dad> slime zones
23:47:56 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm gonna try and kill magma wrym cale makar in a bit
23:49:48 <eric> i just faught magma wyrm
23:50:00 <eric> hes slow but my weapons dont do much
23:50:12 <eric> unless i get it with bleed
23:51:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> maybe i'll try him first because the cale makar wyrm is harder i assume
23:51:18 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what level are you
23:51:27 <eric> 38
23:51:39 <eric> i f i could do frosty stuff i t would be easy i bet
23:51:57 <eric> it just seems like i would have to just do a lot of dodging and it would take a long time right now
23:52:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i think i have a talisman to protect against fire damage
23:52:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm bad at dodging
23:52:16 <eric> oh thats a good idea i have that too
23:52:24 <eric> ok i will try one more time
23:52:29 <shrimp1989dspinfo> good luck
23:52:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ganbatter
23:53:28 <eric> lol i died immediately ok one more time
23:53:31 <alansmithee_> summons help a ton. but 38 may be slightly too low unless you're good at dodging
23:53:41 <alansmithee_> just cause your dmg probably gonna be crap for him
23:53:55 <eric> yeah its just chip damage unlessi get bleed
23:54:03 <eric> which does like 1/8 maybe
23:54:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> you can do the jump+r2 attack as well for a little more damage
23:54:24 <alansmithee_> it sucks cause iirc one of the magma wyrms drops the best katana iirc
23:56:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> the moonveil katana
23:56:54 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this sounds like the type of weapon i want to use
23:57:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i like the speed of the uchigatana
