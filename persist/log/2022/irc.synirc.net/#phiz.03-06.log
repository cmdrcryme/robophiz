17:27:47 <mikev> the nba doing laps around the competition
17:28:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i was explaining to ciaran lsat night that hockey players are the soccer fans of the pro sports world
17:28:45 <mikev> any NA hockey player is probably one of the dumbest people you've ever met
17:28:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's epic
17:29:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> cale makar is both smart and good at hockey which seems like a rare combo
17:29:37 <mikev> a hgih school education if we're being very liberal in our application of the term
17:30:10 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Nude_Riker what are you renting
17:31:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> 12:23:50 PM <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm trying to find examples but yesterday it was gay night at ball arena 
17:31:14 <the_tasteful_nerd> laughing a lot at "gay night at ball arena"
17:31:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao
17:31:31 <shrimp1989dspinfo> they had the gay mens choir sing the national anthem

17:32:01 <the_tasteful_nerd> .l
17:34:31 <mikev> lol will i'm looking at the trendlines on my weight and it is almost perfectly linear
17:34:35 <Nude_Riker> shrimp1989dspinfo, not sure yet, i might pick up last days of disco. usually i browse and pick at random
17:34:56 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol wow mike
17:35:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> impressive
17:35:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> last days of sisqo
17:36:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> mines a fuckin ekg strip https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/aRyOAUrO/1646588156.JPG
17:36:28 <mikev> i mean it's pretty linear on the downswing
17:36:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> well the trend is the trend
17:36:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> time to watch sokosaku
17:36:56 <the_tasteful_nerd> the trend is calculated
17:37:22 <mikev> i wonder how accurate my scale is anyways
17:38:05 <mikev> jumps of a pound between days seem inaccurate and i try to keep the settings the same (piss before morning weigh in)
17:39:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> well yeah i mean water weight can make u fluctuate esp on bulk
17:39:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> but my scale i dont think the weight it displays changes until its like half a lb less or greater
17:39:43 <the_tasteful_nerd> its weird
17:40:08 <the_tasteful_nerd> it was at 166.6 for 10 days and then 165.5 and 164.4 two days after that
17:40:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://twitter.com/zerosuitcamus/status/1500272778251014153?s=21
17:40:26 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dont think a  .1 change registers at all
17:40:28 <mikev> mine only does it in .2s
17:40:49 <mikev> lol
17:41:11 <the_tasteful_nerd> the other weird thing is it will show like 164.4 but over Bluetooth it sends 164.5 to my phone
17:41:19 <the_tasteful_nerd> who knows
17:41:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> i just pay attention to thw trend thats the only important thing
17:42:00 <Nude_Riker> i think i will read a bit then go to Sprouts in the burbs for some reason
17:43:16 <Nude_Riker> that would be dumb actually i wont do that
17:43:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> whats sprouts

18:47:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> shrimp1989dspinfo here you go https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/pl14YZio/1646592453.JPG
18:47:57 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao that kicks ass
18:47:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/OxdtgONm/1646592476.JPG
18:48:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i love it
18:48:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> my goal is to bring this to the beach this summer and drink a nutcracker out of it
18:48:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> what is a nutcracker
18:49:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> these premixed cocktails that guys go down the beach selling illegaly at rockaway and coney island
18:49:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
18:49:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> it can be any number of things in it really but generally i would say you got cognac and blue curaÃ§ao in there for sure
18:50:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> Nutcrackers frequently consist of liquors such as vodka, rum, tequila and cognac, mixed with fruit juice, Kool-Aid or candy. They are sold mainly during the summer on the streets and on the beaches, and come in cups or small plastic bottles.
18:50:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> yup
18:50:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> candy
18:50:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> i never had one with candy in it but makes sense
18:51:09 <shrimp1989dspinfo> jolly rancher lean
18:52:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> i get why you put jolly ranchers in lean but i donâ€™t really understand why youâ€™d put them in a liquor and fruit juice cocktail
18:52:34 <shrimp1989dspinfo> extra fruit flavor
18:54:33 <Nude_Riker> probably because you want to taste the jolly rancher
18:54:56 <Nude_Riker> and also are not very creative in your Mixology
18:55:07 <shrimp1989dspinfo> let's ask jon taffer
18:55:21 <Nude_Riker> lol
18:55:47 <Nude_Riker> taffer would blow up "name brand jolly ranchers? you're wasting money! get generic!"
18:56:23 <shrimp1989dspinfo> are there generic jolly ranchers?
18:56:27 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm thinking about this
18:56:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> idk if i've ever seen any
18:57:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> theres lots of generic hard candies but idk if any of them are exactly like jolly ranchers
18:58:36 <Nude_Riker> taffer would buy them a tub of jolly rancher syrup and a $10k dispenser machine that gets broken and they cant afford to service as soon as he leaves
18:58:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wanna figure out how to foster another cat and see if mango could get along with another cat
18:58:53 <Homie_in_a_geod> he lived with some cats when he was an outdoor cat so i think he could do it
19:00:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lmao Nude_Riker
19:00:06 <NORG> the_tasteful_nerd have u seen lola montes
19:00:17 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i miss the old eps where all the bars were nasty and he just made them clean for 20 min of the ep
19:00:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> Homie_in_a_geod oyu can contact basically any rescue near you and ask about fostering opportunities
19:00:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> have you ever heard the jon taffer quote about the only time he ever cried in a club shrimp1989dspinfo 
19:00:50 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm not sure
19:00:57 <Nude_Riker> its so good
19:01:04 <Nude_Riker> and you HAVE to look up the context after
19:01:32 <shrimp1989dspinfo> this scenario sounds vaguely familiar but i don't knoe
19:01:38 <dreddybajs> hmm yeah im just 1 shotting everything in ng+

19:04:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> ahahahaha
19:04:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> now, if you've seen the movie rocky iv, you might think to yourself, 'that robot looks a lot like the robot from rocky iv'
19:04:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> there's a good reason for this:
19:04:30 <Nude_Riker> "that was out robot"
19:04:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> it is the robot from rocky iv
19:04:44 <NORG> lol
19:04:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my roommat eshowed me this a while ago
19:04:47 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i remember this
19:04:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> they bought the robot from rocky iv and set it up to dance with women at the nightclub
19:04:49 <shrimp1989dspinfo> it's amazing
19:04:52 <ajj> lmfao
19:05:01 <Nude_Riker> god i love how he keeps repeating the robot's voice line
19:05:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> i called into the best show once and told tom scharpling about this
19:05:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think the part where he says the one song that ever moved him to tears with its beauty was my sharona is also underrated

20:38:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> thinking about how last night i nailed the exact length of world on a wire off the top of my head
20:38:11 <the_tasteful_nerd> swish
20:38:32 <NORG> tahts what we like to hear
20:38:42 <NORG> https://puu.sh/INbOM/8a37aca67a.png 
20:38:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
20:39:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> collections are quite possibly the lamest thing on lboxd
20:39:18 <NORG> they make no sense a lot of the time
20:39:20 <NORG> like the lupin one there
20:39:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> u should just keep plugging away at the zatoichi
20:39:26 <NORG> ya
20:39:31 <NORG> zatoichi + bond
20:39:32 <the_tasteful_nerd> im up to number uh 17 or 18 i think
20:39:41 <NORG> 9 is my next 1
20:40:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> let me see if that ones good
20:40:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> oh yeah that ones kinda weak
20:41:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> i was dissapointed a bit in zatoichi's pilgrimage
20:41:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> that one should have just been a picaresque of him going to all the shrines
20:42:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> no fighting
20:42:19 <NORG> i hope he plays chess against the chess expert
20:43:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> i have to watch samaritan zatoichi and then i get to see zatoichi vs yojimbo
20:44:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> are you gonna watc hrevolution tonight norg
20:44:15 <NORG> yes
20:44:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> whats the good place to watch it
20:44:45 <NORG> dont know
20:44:49 <dreddybajs> someone should stream it on discord imo
20:44:53 <dreddybajs> so we can all hang and watch
20:45:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> i think i need to make 10 cuts from this deck
20:45:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> hard to make cuts
20:45:26 <dreddybajs> damn dex bleed build is really fuckin fun

20:47:12 <dreddybajs> wow wont support the company..

20:49:46 <alansmithee_> haven't watched a ppv for wressting in forever
20:51:16 <alansmithee_> the_tasteful_nerd: also is zatoichi better than lone wolf and cub? 
20:51:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> yes imo
20:52:08 <the_tasteful_nerd> but it depends on what you want out of the movies i suppose

20:56:48 <this_fellow_kermit> die bitch
20:56:53 <lettrist> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scunthorpe_problem
20:59:20 <dreddybajs> i used to know a guy from scunthorpe that i played discworld MUD with
20:59:22 <dreddybajs> he was a real piece of shit
21:02:26 <lettrist> lol
21:02:38 <Homie_in_a_geod> you wanna help me make 13 cuts to this edh deck dreddybajs 
21:02:44 <dreddybajs> ya sure
21:02:57 <lettrist> discworld MUD is a supremely deep cut
21:03:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/4647812#paper
21:03:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> this is what ive got rn
21:03:26 <dreddybajs> i was a beast on there lettrist 
21:03:27 <dreddybajs> pvp master
21:03:40 <lettrist> lol, i believe it
21:03:52 <dreddybajs> elesh norn seems a bit win-more Homie_in_a_geod 
21:04:48 <dreddybajs> do you have a farseek to replace rampant growth with?
21:05:01 <dreddybajs> oh i guess that doesnt work if you only have a couple duals
21:05:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> actually i fucked up
21:05:52 <dreddybajs> oh and you have a nature's lore anyway lol
21:06:01 <dreddybajs> adventurous impulse seems like an easy cut
21:06:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> its actually 14 cuts lol i missed a land
21:06:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> if you reload it should be the right number now
21:06:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> elesh does seem a bit win-more, so does parhelion tbh although its more on theme
21:06:26 <dreddybajs> generally i err on the side of finding expensive spells to cut first
21:06:34 <dreddybajs> yeah parhelion can probably go too
21:06:48 <dreddybajs> maybe big elspeth too
21:07:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> big elspeth too good on the theme imo
21:07:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> +1 for 3 tokens is reall good
21:07:12 <dreddybajs> yea
21:07:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> other than adventurous impulse i sort of feel like there might still be too much ramp
21:07:48 <dreddybajs> welcoming vampire seems a bit weak seeing as it only triggers once a turn
21:07:58 <lettrist> guys, is dark souls the best game to play if I want to start playing the dark souls games?
21:08:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah true
21:08:14 <alansmithee_> idk about whispersilk cloak
21:08:15 <Homie_in_a_geod> same with maja
21:08:17 <dreddybajs> lettrist: i would skip straight to dark souls 3 unless you have a penchant for older janky games
21:08:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah whispersilk cloak was definitely on the shortlist for a cut
21:08:42 <dreddybajs> ds1 is a classic and created the genre basically but it's very frustrating and old-feeling in a lot of places
21:08:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> actually
21:08:48 <dreddybajs> ds2 is very controversial, it's marmite
21:08:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> whispersilk is kind of a nonbo with a lot of shit in the deck
21:08:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> because it would stop me tapping emmara
21:09:00 <dreddybajs> ds3 is univerally loved and has huge quality of life and modern updates compared to ds3
21:09:10 <dreddybajs> oh yeah true Homie_in_a_geod 
21:09:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> im not sure about wandering emp
21:10:03 <alansmithee_> parnhelion is kinda meh as well imo
21:10:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah i cut parhelion
21:10:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> im going to make a list of stuff that is borderline
21:10:34 <dreddybajs> Homie_in_a_geod: do you have a decree of justice?
21:10:37 <dreddybajs> that would go well
21:10:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> borderline: i do not
21:10:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> i should probablt get one
21:10:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> er
21:11:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah i dont
21:11:02 <alansmithee_> divine visitation is kinda a nombo with a few of your dudes
21:11:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> in what way
21:11:54 <alansmithee_> it turns everything to angels, and you got a few things that rely on either other creature types or a a variety in the case of battle
21:12:11 <alansmithee_> like knight captain needs soldiers, etc
21:12:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> eh i mean if im at the point where im churning out a lot of angels i think im not really worried about that
21:12:36 <dreddybajs> yeah agree with tom there 
21:12:48 <alansmithee_> oh i agree, but i'd either cut it or other things
21:12:51 <dreddybajs> after you resolve that, every token making spell in the deck is making multiple angels
21:12:53 <dreddybajs> pretty hard to beat
21:13:02 <lettrist> do i need to know the story before I go into ds3?
21:13:16 <alansmithee_> also is esper sentinel just a generic tax card? 
21:13:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> esper sentinel is just extra card draw/tempo domination, feels like an auto include in most white decks at this point
21:13:44 <dreddybajs> no lettrist 
21:14:04 <alansmithee_> yeah i kinda agree, i'm also just not sure your power level or w/e typically
21:14:05 <dreddybajs> the lore is connected to dark souls 1, and there are some callbacks, but the plot/lore in ds is very secondary to the game and cryptic anyway
21:14:27 <dreddybajs> you could watch a couple of dark souls 1 vaatividya lore videos if you want, because theyre very good anyway
21:14:35 <dreddybajs> dark souls 2 has a completely separate plot/lore to 1 and 3
21:15:29 <lettrist> interesting
21:15:56 <dreddybajs> basically all you need to know is that theres something called the First Flame which is keeping it to be the current Age of Fire, and every time the fire is going to go out, a champion is called forth to relight the flame
21:16:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> borderline: scute (i love scute but since this isnt a lands deck idk), sad robot (don't know if it's really necessary here), maja (anthem and token gen is good, but its kind of pricy and the token gen is only on lands), wandering emperor (just not sure about it), join the dance and raise the alarm (kind of low power even though they're on theme; join is better because of the flashback), fecundity (not sure it's worth 
21:16:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> sinking mana into something that's only good if my stuff is dying?), some ramp stuff
21:16:10 <dreddybajs> in dark souls 1 that's the basic plot, and in dark souls 3 it's the same except you're many generations in the future
21:16:46 <lettrist> do u think  they will do a dark sould game and there are guns
21:16:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> im not certain about force of virtue but it seems good
21:16:57 <dreddybajs> yes lettrist , it exists and is called bloodborne
21:17:10 <lettrist> wtf
21:17:53 <dreddybajs> lettrist: also if you look around you should be able to pick up ds3 for 15 euro or so most of the time
21:17:55 <alansmithee_> Homie_in_a_geod: i agree with all of those basically. also is there a particular point in shield of the oversoul? 
21:18:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah thats protection for emmara
21:18:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> makes it so i can attack with her without any drawbacks if i dont have something else out to tap her
21:18:52 <NORG> dark souls 1 is so good
21:18:54 <alansmithee_> ehh do you need it? she's pretty cheap to recast regardless, and you got more than enough other tokens
21:19:10 <alansmithee_> i guess depends on how many cuts you still need
21:19:46 <dreddybajs> i agree with alansmithee_ there, idk how much you need to focus on protecting a 2 mana commander
21:19:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> well im going to cut scute, solemn, maja, and raise the alarm for sure, which puts me needing 5 more i think
21:19:51 <dreddybajs> esp when your deck functions without her
21:20:22 <dreddybajs> if you have a copy of teferi's protection i'd use that as your protection spell 
21:20:26 <shrimp1989dspinfo> dark holes
21:20:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> i have one but its already in another deck
21:21:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> its part of the stupidest combo ever with lethal vapors and grand abolisher
21:21:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> which allows you to infinitely skip your turn for the rest of the game and be impossible to interact with
21:21:36 <shrimp1989dspinfo> why are all these gamers online but not hanging out in voice
21:21:37 <shrimp1989dspinfo> curious
21:21:45 <alansmithee_> fecundity may be good to protect from board wipes a bit but idk
21:22:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah i kind of like fecundity for getting value from chumping too
21:22:30 <dreddybajs> i can come hang now
21:22:31 <Homie_in_a_geod> since im not really destroying stuff i dont care about the symmetrical effect
21:22:37 <Homie_in_a_geod> im getting in voice
21:22:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hell yeah
21:22:47 <dreddybajs> on vc
21:24:51 <alansmithee_> gideon ally of zendicar may be ok. i know you're trying to cut cards but a dude who makes a token or can pop an anthem isn't terrible
21:25:57 <alansmithee_> i also liked triumph of the horde for my edh token-y decks
21:26:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> wow shrimp1989dspinfo.
21:26:36 <Homie_in_a_geod> good talking to u.
21:26:39 <shrimp1989dspinfo> my mic is not WORKIGN
21:26:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> :(
21:27:18 <this_fellow_kermit> 9:08 PM <dreddybajs> ds1 is a classic and created the genre basically but it's very frustrating and old-feeling in a lot of places
21:27:29 <this_fellow_kermit> its the best one by far
21:27:34 <this_fellow_kermit> idc what letty does though 
21:34:58 <lettrist> i am gonna play only dark souls 2, it seems leftfield and great!
21:40:01 <this_fellow_kermit> i remembered another song that should be on the phiz mixtape

23:19:44 <bonegar> perhaps i will have 1 more beer next sunday

23:33:07 <mikev> hfboards ftw
23:33:09 <mikev> I'm not going to offer specific names of who we should look at and where they fit in capwise. It's been talked about to exhaustion at this point. However, I'm starting to believe the best route to go as far as defensive upgrades it targeting multiple productive players rather than going after one big fish. A fourth line upgrade in the Clutterbuck or Barclay Goodrow mold would also be a welcome addition, imo.
23:34:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> trump ftw
