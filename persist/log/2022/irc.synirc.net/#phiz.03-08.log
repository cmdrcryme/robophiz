00:00:31 <eric> i think there were 6 of us last week
00:00:53 <bonegar> is it like through a university or private or something else
00:00:54 <eric> people come and go a bit
00:01:01 <eric> its through the french cultural centre
00:01:14 <eric> my first course with them was great so its pretty disappointing
00:01:21 <alansmithee_> dreddybajs: i'll hop in in a few minutes
00:01:32 <dreddybajs> lol i was so close to killing godrick just now FUCK
00:01:33 <bonegar> ah thats a bummer
00:01:35 <dreddybajs> np alansmithee_ 
00:02:54 <bonegar> is the teacher really new or just have some kinda vacation gig going on.. i wonder why she's bad
00:03:12 <eric> i dont knkow
00:03:42 <eric> though i do know shes running the class from a ski resort somewhere because shes mentioned that
00:03:59 <eric> and she has people that she tutors privately
00:04:00 <Nude_Riker> did it cost much?
00:04:11 <eric> not really
00:04:27 <eric> but i dont think thats an excuse for this level of disorganization 
00:04:35 <Nude_Riker> im guessing she doesnt have much formal education in teaching and just does it due to being bilingual for minimal pay
00:04:48 <Nude_Riker> not saying  thats an excuse
00:04:51 <dreddybajs> really good assumptions
00:05:23 <eric> i expect you are right
00:06:22 <Nude_Riker> im guessing that because it describes my mom when she taught french
00:06:38 <Nude_Riker> except she was a better teacher i am going to guess, because she's my mom
00:07:04 <Nude_Riker> check this guy out https://twitter.com/monkeylover_BOT/status/1500985979448233984
00:07:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> the_tasteful_nerd: so im trying to make a recipe on this shit and it is only allowing me to add a specific amount of servings? i have no idea how to deal with this
00:07:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> servings of what
00:07:44 <this_fellow_kermit> https://twitter.com/Rook_Harry/status/871067982977527809
00:07:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> like an ingredient
00:07:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> yes
00:07:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> ?
00:07:55 <Homie_in_a_geod> an ingredient
00:07:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> which ingredient is it
00:08:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> barilla gluten free macaroni
00:08:29 <dreddybajs> godrick down
00:08:33 <dreddybajs> i was about to ask alansmithee_ for help lol
00:08:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> i wold just search for the generic 'gluten free pasta'
00:08:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> which you can use g or oz for
00:09:02 <the_tasteful_nerd> the macros are probably pretty close. not about being perfect
00:09:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> it doesnt have the right kind of gf pasta and it also only allows me to add by the tbsp lol
00:09:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> one tablespoon of pasta please
00:09:44 <Nude_Riker> lol
00:09:45 <eric> lol
00:09:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> search 'gluten free pasta'
00:09:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> i already did
00:09:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> and hit the 'common' tab
00:09:56 <the_tasteful_nerd> thats the generic stuff
00:10:01 <the_tasteful_nerd> im lookin at it rn
00:10:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> theres 'corn and rice' and 'brown rice' gluten free pastas (this is neither)
00:10:21 <Nude_Riker> i know that you are committing to this for other reasons but flexibility on this to always add in grams is one reason i like cronometer for nutrition tracking
00:10:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> i actually have no fucking clue which one of it is
00:10:35 <eric> i bet either is good enough
00:10:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> you can always add everything in the common section in g
00:10:48 <dreddybajs> yeah sounds like either is good enough for government work to me
00:10:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> and most stuff you can add in g
00:10:56 <Nude_Riker> G
00:10:59 <dreddybajs> ^
00:11:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont even know how many grams are in a fuckin lb ugh
00:11:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> then do wt. oz
00:11:17 <the_tasteful_nerd> 16 oz
00:11:17 <dreddybajs> dont let perfect be the enemy of good tom :)
00:11:24 <dreddybajs> come on bro u got google
00:11:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think thats what im doing here
00:11:28 <the_tasteful_nerd> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/v4KQX1xu/1646698285.JPG
00:11:56 <the_tasteful_nerd> top one there, u can use wt oz and do 16 oz for a lb
00:12:05 <Nude_Riker> Gluten Free Pasta: Common item. 1 cup. Sells for 1 bronze.
00:12:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> well idk why the fuck it comes up that way for you and not me
00:12:19 <the_tasteful_nerd> on the common tab? 
00:12:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/fQDy0T3B/IMG_8195.PNG
00:12:33 <the_tasteful_nerd> weird
00:12:50 <Nude_Riker> i bet its related to the plate vs recipe search for a dumb reason
00:12:51 <eric> idk if this makes different but wills says Your Plate
00:12:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> i cant even get that to come up in mine
00:12:58 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
00:12:58 <eric> while yours says Create Recipe
00:13:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh ok if i actually add the barilla pasta to the recipe
00:13:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> it allows me to change the units at that point
00:13:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> this is not obvious
00:13:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah thats fine the macros arent terribly different across most pastas really
00:13:39 <Nude_Riker> tell them to make their ux better come on now, that is bad design
00:13:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> it doesnt happen for me
00:14:42 <the_tasteful_nerd> but i have months of search personalization data
00:14:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> though i've never searched gluten free pasta
00:15:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> i think it might be a db thing
00:15:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> you can scan the barcode of almsot anyhing with a UPC code
00:15:26 <the_tasteful_nerd> to get it to come up
00:15:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> but obv if the db doesnt have the serving in grams for a certain item that wont help
00:15:58 <the_tasteful_nerd> but i usually only encounter that with like niche sauces
00:16:53 <Nude_Riker> im going to take a shower even though i took one this morning >:)
00:17:02 <the_tasteful_nerd> oh Homie_in_a_geod i figured it out its a database thing
00:17:04 <eric> i took one last night 
00:17:10 <eric> i was thinking of taking one today too
00:17:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> i think you're using the beta DB
00:17:16 <eric> i feel wiped out
00:17:18 <the_tasteful_nerd> i switched to that and now i see what you're seeing
00:17:38 <Nude_Riker> i was feeling wiped out before yoga and now im feeling calm
00:17:46 <the_tasteful_nerd> the calming power of the yog
00:17:49 <Nude_Riker> hope you feel better soon eric, restederic
00:17:54 <the_tasteful_nerd> The Power of The Yog
00:18:04 <eric> thjanks 
00:18:16 <Nude_Riker> i have started last year's adriene 30 day challenge
00:18:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> how diff is it
00:18:51 <bonegar> finally killed miriam
00:19:22 -!- sleepalot_poopalot [~cgiirc@synIRC-385A46B9.res.spectrum.com] has joined #phiz
00:20:19 <Nude_Riker> well im only one day in but i think she follows the same progressing/concept for each day every year, like day 6 is a really intense core workout, 7 is a rest day and so on
00:20:30 <Nude_Riker> last year's was "Breath" this year's was "Move"
00:20:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> the_tasteful_nerd: do i put in 'servings' as the amount that the recipe serves
00:20:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> according to the recipe
00:20:44 <Nude_Riker> if i may say, adriene was looking really hot last year
00:21:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dont use that much, i think if you were making a big batch of some meal prep thing and then splitting it out into like 10 servings you can put something there
00:21:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> but once i create a recipe i just dump it oiut into a bowl and weigh it in grams
00:21:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> and then log it as grams
00:21:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> otherwise you're just guessing at what a 'serving' is
00:22:13 <Homie_in_a_geod> wait hold on so like
00:22:19 <Homie_in_a_geod> gdi im fuckin confused
00:22:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> so it gave me a # in grams, automatically, i guess based on the ingredients i put in
00:22:37 <the_tasteful_nerd> yes
00:22:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> u can just leave 'servings' at 1
00:22:45 <Homie_in_a_geod> and the recipe says it makes 6-8 servings
00:23:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> i mean you can put it in there if you want, but its only for your convenience so you can log a 'serving' in the logger w/o weighing it out
00:23:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> so when i log it into this i just want to weigh out my serving
00:23:17 <Homie_in_a_geod> right
00:23:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> its not going to fuck it up what i mark down as a serving?
00:23:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah thats more accurate imo
00:23:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> no, itll just give you 2 options for units to log
00:23:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> is that only for if im just saying "i had x servings of this"
00:23:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> ya you got it
00:23:49 <Homie_in_a_geod> ok
00:24:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> im going to try to eat roughly the same amount for dinner as i did before
00:24:08 <the_tasteful_nerd> so if you wanna like eyeball it that can work but if yo're just gonna weigh it anyway it doesnt matter
00:24:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> im also just going to assume that any hot sauce i ever use is negligible
00:24:23 <Nude_Riker> yeah except sodium
00:24:42 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah most of that stuff is just a wash
00:24:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> unless theres a significant amount of oil or sugar
00:24:54 <the_tasteful_nerd> and usually there isnt
00:25:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> the one thing to watch out for is any cooking oils though
00:25:08 <Nude_Riker> obviously if you're using a cream dressing thats diff
00:25:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> like if you cooked 3 eggs in a pan w/ some oil you wanna log the oil too because thats a significant amt of calories
00:25:25 <Nude_Riker> yeah measuring your oils when cooking is a pain but they're liquid calories
00:25:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> i usually eyeball them and log like a tbsp if im feeling lazy
00:25:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> and i dont have a spoon handy
00:25:51 <Nude_Riker> yeah but you gotta measure first to know
00:25:55 <Nude_Riker> how to eyeball
00:26:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> thats true
00:26:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> ive gotten pretty good at guesstimating the amounts of things
00:26:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> im not good at that and i also will not be
00:27:12 <Homie_in_a_geod> in the future
00:27:15 <Nude_Riker> did you get that gram scale
00:27:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> the things you eat a lot of you'll get a feel for over time after weighing them out so many times
00:27:52 <the_tasteful_nerd> like i know a handful of cheerios for me is about 10g
00:27:52 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
00:28:00 <Nude_Riker> lol
00:28:12 <Nude_Riker> i can estimate 28g of most nuts
00:28:23 <sleepalot_poopalot> mods
00:28:27 <Nude_Riker> :)
00:28:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah i can see how that would be easy, for you

00:35:00 <bonegar> lol
00:35:02 <bonegar> cool lifestyle
00:36:03 <Nude_Riker> watching the stats of my car as i eat
00:36:17 <the_tasteful_nerd> sitting in my tesla, munching on chicky nuggs, watching wall-e
00:42:08 <dreddybajs> now online on 'cord btw
00:42:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> lmao
00:42:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/freshfryapp/the-fresh-fry-app
00:42:51 <dreddybajs> i just went on voice on a discord with an old friend of mine and his gf was on, and began being extremely racist in french thinking i couldnt understand
00:43:01 <dreddybajs> and i said i can understand you and then it was very awkward and then i quit
00:43:02 <dreddybajs> lol
00:43:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> well logged everything in for the day and significantly over calorie goal on an amount of food that has left me feeling starving
00:43:22 <Homie_in_a_geod> very good.
00:43:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> off to a great start
00:43:35 <dreddybajs> woot
00:44:10 <dreddybajs> Homie_in_a_geod: this sounds impossible at first but remember that feeling hungry is behavioural, and not actually your body needing food, and you will adjust 
00:44:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> not actually happy about it
00:44:39 <dreddybajs> yes i didnt mean to say you were 
00:44:52 <dreddybajs> im just saying, thats a fact, and you can power through, and i believe in you :)
00:45:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> well thank you
00:45:18 <Homie_in_a_geod> my mind is revolting against this entire endeavor extremely hard
00:45:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> trying to suppress that
00:45:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah. tell it to stfu
00:45:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> if it were that easy to do that i wouldnt need adderall
00:46:06 <dreddybajs> yeah Homie_in_a_geod thats the battle, defeating old habits and creating new routines
00:46:16 <dreddybajs> which is really hard and requires committment, im not gonna say it doesnt
00:46:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> if u need some inspo check this out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS2HdJZwFnI
00:46:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol
00:46:34 <Homie_in_a_geod> .y mindfudged
00:46:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> ^
00:46:51 <Homie_in_a_geod> what you gonna wear. what you gonna drive.
00:46:54 <the_tasteful_nerd> what rate of weight loss did you tell it you wanted
00:47:01 <the_tasteful_nerd> horse apples ftw
00:47:08 <Homie_in_a_geod> i didnt tell it that i wanted one, it chose that for me
00:47:27 <Homie_in_a_geod> it told me 1.5 lbs a week and like 4.8 a month or some shit
00:47:37 <dreddybajs> thats very doable tom, you can def do it
00:47:47 <dreddybajs> just be very honest with yourself about inputting the cals
00:47:47 <Homie_in_a_geod> doesnt feel like it but thank you anyway
00:48:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> well i mean theres a slider for rate of loss when you set the goal
00:48:40 <dreddybajs> also living with someone obv impacts this in a big way, goes without saying but make sure shes bought in and knows this is important to you
00:48:46 <Homie_in_a_geod> i did not see any sort of slider when i went through it
00:48:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> i think by default it sticks you at like 0.5% of bodyweight per week
00:49:04 <dreddybajs> and yeah you can always go lower if you wish
00:49:19 <dreddybajs> Homie_in_a_geod: do you feel like you've been maintaining weight for the last period or gaining weight?
00:49:24 <Homie_in_a_geod> gaining
00:49:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> which is why i feel like i want to lose weight
00:49:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/Vh8RUnDJ/1646700577.JPG
00:49:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> the little orange green thing is a slider
00:49:50 <dreddybajs> ok well yeah, maybe easier to start by going to maintenance for a week or two then dropping cals 
00:49:58 <dreddybajs> rather than going to weight loss straight away
00:50:11 <the_tasteful_nerd> well he's not gonna know what maintenance is if he ahsnt been tracking calories or weight so 
00:50:12 <dreddybajs> understanding your maintainence cals is important for the beginning i think
00:50:15 <dreddybajs> yeah true
00:50:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> itll be all over the place
00:50:16 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wasnt going to fuck with it though because i figured it knew what to recommend me better than i know what ot plug in myself
00:51:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> im trying not to talk about all the ways i imagine this going wrong but one thing that i know is going to happen is that if i do get into it, im going to be like mentally gamifying any time i just dont fucking eat at all as an internal victory which will cause me to end up starving in the middle of the night and eat a bunch of crap
00:51:18 <the_tasteful_nerd> its not an internal victory not to eat
00:51:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> i know myself well enough to know that is going to happen, without any doubt
00:51:33 <the_tasteful_nerd> u gotta eat
00:51:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> but if you do end up doing it, the good thing is, it wont matter much, as long as you go back to being consistent
00:52:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> a 600 cal surplus on one day isnt going to negate a deficit over the rest of the week
00:52:14 <Nude_Riker> having protein powder and fiber before bed helped me avoid doing that tom
00:52:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> you just cant do it every other day
00:52:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> and also yes fibrous foods and vegetables are your friends
00:52:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> u can eat like 2lbs of broccoli and its 300 cals lol
00:53:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> sydney cant eat broccoli really so i almost never eat broccoli
00:53:18 <eric> take off voice
00:53:22 <Nude_Riker> damn i didnt know you could be allergic to brocc that sucks
00:53:33 <Homie_in_a_geod> shes not allergic it just doesnt agree with her stomach
00:53:40 <dreddybajs>  yeah will is right tom, you can go off occasionally, but as long as youre gradually making better habits thats what its all about
00:53:40 <the_tasteful_nerd> a lot of people have gi issues w/ brassicas
00:53:44 <Homie_in_a_geod> most carciferous vegetables do not
00:53:47 <Nude_Riker> damn
00:53:49 <dreddybajs> as with fitness "this is a marathon not a sprint" Homie_in_a_geod 
00:54:00 <dreddybajs> you dont need to crucify yourself for fucking up once
00:54:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> but for your first week at least i would not worry too much about going over its calorie target as long as its not like +1000 calories
00:54:05 <dreddybajs> this is about building better habits
00:54:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> very hard for me to take that view but i appreciate the encouragement even if i do not sound like i do right now
00:54:23 <the_tasteful_nerd> because on next monday it will update your calorie recommendation
00:54:30 <the_tasteful_nerd> and itll have better data to use
00:54:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> but get a scale. thats key
00:54:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> i remembered we have a bed bath and beyond gift cards so im going to use that for a scale
00:54:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> it cant do its magic w/o a couple weigh ins
00:54:52 <dreddybajs> if you fuck up majorly one week of a month but do a little better gradually the other 3 weeks, you are still building a very healthy long term plan Homie_in_a_geod 
00:54:56 <Nude_Riker> this is a really excellent exchange btw https://twitter.com/matthewgoldin/status/1500585590202322945
00:54:59 <dreddybajs> thats what im trying to say, idk if it makes sense
00:55:30 <Homie_in_a_geod> it makes sense i guess
00:55:44 <Nude_Riker> https://twitter.com/matthewgoldin/status/1500997396049711107
00:55:50 <dreddybajs> lol very good Nude_Riker 
00:55:53 <the_tasteful_nerd> macrofactor gives you a nice trend line too for weight and does not overreact to fluctuations
00:56:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/mrVavOHU/1646700973.JPG
00:56:23 <Homie_in_a_geod> idk the last time i really tried to do this i wasnt counting calories at all, i was just making one big batch of food on the weekend and eating the same salad for lunch at work every day and trying to consciously avoid starches wherever i could
00:56:29 <Homie_in_a_geod> and i dropped like 20 lbs
00:56:35 <Homie_in_a_geod> then i fell off extremely hard and never got back to it
00:56:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah this is a better way to do it because it allows flexibility in your diet
00:56:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> because the calories are what actually matter
00:56:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> from a weight perspective
00:57:02 <dreddybajs> very good twitter in general there Nude_Riker 
00:57:26 <dreddybajs> yes Homie_in_a_geod thats what im tryin to say to you: its about slowly building better habits which you can maintain long term
00:57:30 <the_tasteful_nerd> a lot of people do that and drop weight but if its not a sustainable like habit change that lasts beyond a certain time frame the weight tends to creep back up
00:57:31 <Nude_Riker> yeah, i cant take following him but he's really good
00:57:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> obv your not gonna eat the same salad every day for the rest of your life
00:57:47 <dreddybajs> right exactly the_tasteful_nerd 
00:58:02 <eric> when i was on my diet i mostly just was like on work out days i can have one moderately sized starchy meal and non work out days like the most i could have was a slice of bread
00:58:12 <eric> and the only treat i could have was yogurt and peanut butter
00:58:28 <dreddybajs> this is also the same as other brain problems, you need to slowly acclimate yourself to the new normal
00:58:40 <dreddybajs> there is no magic fast solution, its about routine and habits
00:58:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah eric i've been there
00:59:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> but im completely on the other side of it
00:59:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> carbs: they rock
00:59:46 <eric> i feel sad when folks have to / think they have to cut them out all together
00:59:52 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah
01:00:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> i mean its just an ongoing process of figuring out not
01:00:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> What Can I Eat
01:00:18 <eric> yeah everyones diff 
01:00:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> but what are the things that I enjoy that meet the goals ive set
01:00:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> if youre a fat piece of shit who wants to achieve weight loss quickly you probably do need to cut them out to a significant extent
01:00:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> and fit the macros im looking for
01:00:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> nope
01:00:40 <eric> and like what kind of diet you can tolerate vs to meet your goals is a tricky wicket !
01:01:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> i'd say thats only true insofar as you cannot control your intake of carbohydrates
01:01:14 <the_tasteful_nerd> its nothing innate to carbohydrates themselves
01:01:38 <eric> the thing with all of this stuff is the advice is simple but the execution is hard
01:01:46 <eric> because you must battle yourself
01:01:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> but: restricting them entirely doesnt teach you how to have a diet where you meet your calorie goals when they are part of your diet
01:02:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> so once you inevitably reintroduce them, you're bound to stumble
01:02:14 <Homie_in_a_geod> lol who would want this https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/lMvBW6Zo/image.png
01:02:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol ???
01:02:25 <Homie_in_a_geod> you might as well get a scale that plays the family feud [X] sound when you step on it
01:02:36 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah that seems very bad to buy a scale that shames you
01:02:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> it also has the highest rating on the entire bed bath and beyond website
01:02:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> how much is it
01:03:03 <Homie_in_a_geod> all of these scales say "order by 5pm, get it today" but also "backordered"
01:03:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> uh 30 bucks
01:04:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> bed bath and beyond always has these weirdo brands i dont see anywere else
01:04:16 <shrimp1989dspinfo> cale makar goal ftw
01:05:06 <dreddybajs> Homie_in_a_geod> if youre a fat piece of shit who wants to achieve weight loss quickly you probably do need to cut them out to a significant extent <-- right but heres what im trying to say, its not about achieving quick weight loss, its about achieving sustainable manageable weight loss
01:05:22 <dreddybajs> because quick weight loss with no plan = bounce back 
01:06:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> lot of people saying all of the digital scales give inaccurate readings
01:06:04 <Homie_in_a_geod> in the reviews
01:06:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> maybe i should get an analog
01:06:27 <bonegar> how accurate are you trying to be
01:06:41 <Homie_in_a_geod> uh, within a pound i would think
01:06:51 <the_tasteful_nerd> i wouldnt worry about the accuracy too much but yeah
01:07:02 <Homie_in_a_geod> i dont think this shit will be very good at tracking my weight loss if its not consistently accurate to within 3 lbs
01:07:10 <dreddybajs> yeah the thing that matters is that the weight is slowly trending down week to week
01:07:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> i mean if it's consistently over by 2 lbs or under by 2lbs it will be fine
01:07:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> oh ok theres a thing on the bed bath and beyond website to shop for analog scales, and you click it, and it shows you: no scales
01:07:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> but if it can swing +/- 4 lbs
01:07:32 <Homie_in_a_geod> because they dont actually have any
01:07:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> then thats diff
01:07:50 <dreddybajs> tom youre doing the thing where youre creating a problem where there isnt any
01:07:55 <the_tasteful_nerd> if it just always overcounts or undercounts its not as big of a deal because the trend is all that matters
01:07:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> what are you talking about
01:08:11 <Homie_in_a_geod> what problem am i creating
01:08:17 <dreddybajs> it doesnt matter how accurate a scale is, as long as it broadly records you trending down in weight
01:08:21 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol i just found out why i'll stay the same weight for days at a time
01:08:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> We also found that this smart scale, like many regular bathroom scales, sometimes recalled a previous weight instead of weighing fresh each time. When we contacted Eufy, the company wrote in reply that its scale utilizes “recalls of measurements within 300g (approximately 0.66lbs) … to prevent the user from taking two consecutive measurements and having inconsistent weighing data due to standing position or other 
01:08:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> reasons.” 
01:08:33 <dreddybajs> lol the_tasteful_nerd 
01:08:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> so until i lose .66lbs it wont register a new weight
01:09:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> i guess thats good to know, but i'd just prefer it be accurate
01:09:11 <dreddybajs> never mind Homie_in_a_geod that obv didnt come across like i meant it to
01:09:40 <Homie_in_a_geod> all of these people in the negative reviews, of which every scale has a significant amount, are saying that the fluctuations are random, so the trending down would be extremely broadly and i would need a lot of data points to be getting a more accurate line of best fit, if thats true
01:09:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> so like, it does matter to me that the scale is accurate
01:10:16 <dreddybajs> ok
01:10:20 <Homie_in_a_geod> ok i did finally find a fucking analog scale on this website
01:10:20 <dreddybajs> again i take it back
01:10:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> this website is laid out like Shit
01:10:54 <dreddybajs> sorry what i was trying to say, which is the same as before, is dont be obsessed with scale measurements, just create better fitness and eating habits. the numbers will follow
01:11:09 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah the bed bath and beyond site sucks
01:14:07 <sleepalot_poopalot> took 2 shits time 2 nap
01:14:21 <dreddybajs> hmm
01:14:22 <dreddybajs> checks out
01:14:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
01:21:07 <NORG> lol
01:25:28 <Homie_in_a_geod> this entire thing is making me feel viscerally fuckin terrible
01:26:39 <Homie_in_a_geod> i get to the point of checking out on this scale and tell sydney the gift card is mostly used up by it so she says 'you should use the rest of the gift card' and i start getting super fucking agitated over trying to add a fucking hairbrush and some toothpaste onto the order because i am so thrown off kilter by this whole fucking thing
01:26:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> so fucking stupid
01:26:46 <dreddybajs> Homie_in_a_geod: i feel like that's been true for previous weight loss/fitness attempts also and that's something you must look inward to progress from
01:26:49 <dreddybajs> sorry if that's harsh
01:26:50 <Homie_in_a_geod> to the point of absurdity
01:27:08 <ajj> the bed bath and beyond website sucks dick
01:27:16 <ajj> was trying to buy whippers there the other day 
01:27:21 <Homie_in_a_geod> i mean i cant fuckin help it man

13:57:01 <the_tasteful_nerd> look at me mom i'm a python dev
13:58:20 <the_tasteful_nerd> btw if any of the actual devy folks itc want to help me w/ a new weather function i'd happily accept the assistance
13:58:42 <Rusty> i don't know much about IRC bots but i'm game to try new shit
13:59:02 <mpg> please get it into github
13:59:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> i mean the default skybot shit is on github
13:59:14 <the_tasteful_nerd> atm
13:59:15 <mpg> so we can all work on it and push branches and stuff
13:59:17 <the_tasteful_nerd> .g skybot github
13:59:20 <mpg> lol
13:59:21 <Rusty> is it just a matter of finding a weather service with a free API?
13:59:22 <mpg> i know that
13:59:24 <mpg> i need Your code
13:59:46 <the_tasteful_nerd> it's tough to get all that shit working inside my shitty docker contaner
14:00:16 <the_tasteful_nerd> rusty i think i found one called tomorrow.io or something
14:00:24 <the_tasteful_nerd> that will give us a decent amount of free calls
14:00:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> but i havent looked at the documentation for how it returns values in json or anything
14:01:41 <Rusty> jkwon
14:02:23 <Rusty> checking out the docs now
14:03:15 <mpg> i don't know how your docker config is setup so i can't really help there but adding stuff to github is easy
14:03:26 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah let me get an account and give it a try
14:03:34 <Rusty> petition to start pronouncing it like chris gethard's last name
14:03:44 <mpg> you can use a gui app to manage git stuff or do it on command line
14:03:46 <the_tasteful_nerd> chris github
14:03:58 <the_tasteful_nerd> well i'd have to do it on command line cause the docker container runs on my nas
14:04:05 <mpg> sourcetree is decent
14:04:19 <mpg> thats cool, i know command line better anyway
14:04:45 <mpg> all you really need to do is make a gh account, make a new (empty) repo, then do like
14:04:52 <mpg> git remote add origin <your repo link>
14:05:09 <mpg> you will probably have to add ssh keys too but that is also easy
14:06:01 <Rusty> git cli. also known as the 'clit'

14:06:41 <mpg> haha

14:21:02 <mpg> goot thing you dont have to use it for work
14:21:14 <the_tasteful_nerd> cause it says a remote origin already exists

14:22:32 <the_tasteful_nerd> i wonder if i delete all the .git folder and try again
14:22:37 <the_tasteful_nerd> will it treat it like something new
14:22:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> maybe i should just copy it all out to my macbook and push from there
14:23:39 <mpg> oh thats because its probably still linked to the original repo
14:23:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah
14:23:55 <mpg> dont delete all of .git
14:23:59 <mpg> you can just remove the origin
14:25:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> hmm the origin is in the config file
14:25:02 <the_tasteful_nerd> as my repo
14:25:39 <mpg> git remote remove origin
14:25:45 <mpg> then run the remote add again as yours
14:26:51 <mpg> and actually ive just learned you dont have to remove and add you can use this
14:26:51 <mpg> git remote set-url origin git://new.url.here
14:27:37 <bonegar> absolutely bizarre nerdculture, there are so many posts of people just going "same" for variosu problems on things, which i feel nerds should get furious about, then other things are so maticulously organized with weird features
14:27:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> this shit sucks dick
14:28:08 <the_tasteful_nerd> no i mean my origin i set
14:28:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> is in the config
14:28:14 <the_tasteful_nerd> but its missing some refs

14:33:17 <mpg> lol
14:33:18 <Nude_Riker> yeah NORG he's been on oxygen for a minute
14:33:19 <mpg> git --version
14:34:03 <mpg> that's pretty weird that there's no master branch or main branch
14:34:05 <mpg> very unusual
14:34:38 <mpg> i guess at this point you can nuke the .git directory and do a fresh init
14:35:30 <the_tasteful_nerd> 2.20.1
14:36:19 <mpg> figures, they added show current in 2.22
14:36:28 <mpg> git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
14:36:44 <mpg> we're trying to figure out the branch name at HEAD
14:37:05 <mpg> too bad there's no git HEAD command
14:37:16 <Rusty> lol
14:37:41 <the_tasteful_nerd> ref: refs/heads/master
14:37:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> is in the head file
14:37:57 <mpg> lol
14:38:02 <mpg> so it can't find that ref
14:38:05 <mpg> yet, there it is
14:38:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah
14:38:18 <mpg> pretty strange
14:38:27 <mpg> nuke from orbit
14:38:54 <the_tasteful_nerd> i wonder if its trying to read the .git file from the root
14:38:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> probably
14:39:12 <mpg> oh 
14:39:17 <mpg> is there a git inside of a git
14:39:30 <mpg> that will def cause issues
14:39:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> well i installed via git and then when i was fucking with code i moved the shit around to diff dirs
14:40:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> so i dont remember where it initially was installed but i think i was just at / when i installed it initially
14:40:04 <the_tasteful_nerd> i think at this point it might be easier for me to copy the bot out onto my macbook and set up the repo there
14:40:14 <mpg> yeah you can do that
14:40:25 <the_tasteful_nerd> because we dont need the full bot really on github, skybot is all plugin based
14:40:27 <mpg> and then just clone it back
14:40:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> and i dont see a ton of reason to go fucking around with the core code
14:40:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> unless we want to add new functionality it doesnt have at all
14:40:51 <mpg> sure, that's reasonable
14:41:01 <the_tasteful_nerd> but its got plenty of hooks for http and regex stuff
14:47:10 <the_tasteful_nerd> oh for god's sake lol
14:47:18 <the_tasteful_nerd> gotta reinstall xcode dev tools
14:48:05 <Rusty> lol
14:48:07 <Rusty> RIP your hard drive
14:48:24 <Rusty> i had to do that on a 2012 macbook air and it required uninstalling EVERYTHING else basically
14:48:43 <Rusty> steve jobs: eat this ass
14:48:47 <mpg> xcode-tools are not large, xcode itself is large
14:48:53 <mpg> you do not need to install full xcode
14:48:56 <Rusty> ohhhh you're right. you're right.
14:49:06 <Rusty> well the thing i was doing, barked at me to install the fullness
14:49:10 <Rusty> i forget what it even was at this point
14:49:20 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol this time estimation is wild
14:49:26 <mpg> lol
14:49:29 <the_tasteful_nerd> jumped from 50 min to like 6 min
14:49:29 <the_tasteful_nerd> to 20
14:49:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> now its at 9
14:49:36 <mpg> has time estimation on computers ever been good i wonder
14:49:48 <mpg> i remember it being wacky in win 95 days too
14:49:49 <the_tasteful_nerd> this is some windows ass shit
14:49:56 <the_tasteful_nerd> usually macos is a lil better about this
14:50:02 <the_tasteful_nerd> OR it just doesnt quote you a time
14:50:03 <the_tasteful_nerd> lol
14:50:32 <mpg> the first time i ever installed slackware, the software literally was like "This may take a while. Go make a pizza"
14:50:53 <Rusty> lol
14:54:47 <Rusty> criterion flash sale today at noon & i'm not even excited
14:54:50 <Rusty> they been fuckin up too much lately
14:56:05 <Rusty> maybe i'll pick up Tampopo or something, i keep forgetting i don't own it
14:56:27 <mpg> love tampopo
14:56:36 <mpg> so charming
14:57:12 <Rusty> yeah idk why they don't put out more Itami on physical discs. i know Funeral is coming soon but i want like, Supermarket Woman and shit
14:57:34 <Rusty> gimme a big boxset that includes Sweet Home as a bonus 
14:57:45 <mpg> i haven't seen anything else, just tampopo
14:57:50 <mpg> mainly because it's about food
14:57:52 <Nude_Riker> i wont buy more discs as i havent watched a single one of all the movies i bought the last year
14:57:55 <Nude_Riker> tampopo ftw
14:58:03 <Rusty> itami's whole career is good shit imo
14:58:29 <Rusty> shame he made movies about comical yakuza people and then got iced by some yakuza people
14:59:28 <scoop_jackson> ;/
14:59:34 <scoop_jackson> didnt know thAT
14:59:36 <bonegar> good way to go
15:00:04 <bonegar> idk why people love tampopo so much
15:00:09 <Rusty> i guess they were like "we can kill you or you can take your chances jumping off this roof. you might live, who knows"
15:00:21 <scoop_jackson> tampopo is great 
15:00:23 <Rusty> what do you know, about people. let's make a list
15:00:25 <this_fellow_kermit> im in my bed
15:00:26 <bonegar> idk why people love tampopo so much
15:00:27 <Rusty> 1) ....????
15:00:47 <mpg> lol of course you dont
15:01:50 <bonegar> it's not very good
15:02:07 <mpg> opinion noted
15:02:19 <scoop_jackson> they made me watch it in school so at least in my case its because ive been indoctrinated 
15:02:28 <this_fellow_kermit> tampoopoo
15:02:29 <bonegar> yeah seems like something they make you watchin school
15:03:07 <Nude_Riker> i didnt watch it in school
15:03:13 <Nude_Riker> the egg scene is way too horny for school
15:03:44 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i had a dream that i was hanging out with Nude_Riker somewhere but he didn't actually spend any time with me because he kept having to run to the video store to return movies and rent new ones
15:03:55 <mpg> lol
15:04:38 <Nude_Riker> haha
15:05:30 <bonegar> this github shit makes me want to die... why are all these documents full of so much useless information
15:06:05 <bonegar> layers upon layers of weird fussy stuff i have to ignore
15:06:08 <mpg> welcome to developer documentation 
15:06:17 <mpg> it's all pretty terrible
15:06:49 <bonegar> it's weird because they all brag about efficiency, but there are so many bizarre steps to get anything to work
15:06:57 <mpg> lol who brags about that.
15:07:14 <bonegar> software engineers
15:07:23 <bonegar> they love to pretend they're efficient
15:07:36 <mpg> maybe on hacker news
15:07:46 <bonegar> i think i'm understanding why theey're obsessed with 'efficiency' now
15:08:07 <mpg> that doesn't really happen irl
15:08:12 <shrimp1989dspinfo> hackernews guys are elite programmers
15:08:17 <bonegar> because absolutely nothing is, and i'm being yelled at to use metabuddy or something just layers upon layers of shit
15:08:21 <bonegar> curling a git
15:08:32 <mpg> sounds like it's not for you
15:08:38 <bonegar> of course it isn't
15:08:43 <mpg> shrimp1989dspinfo: i really hate the hacker news personality
15:08:47 <mpg> it's intolerable
15:08:59 <bonegar> i dont have nerdbrain
15:09:14 <mpg> yeah you have normal brain
15:09:25 <scoop_jackson> maze brain
15:09:31 <bonegar> ^
15:09:41 <bonegar> i only have mazebrain
15:11:03 <shrimp1989dspinfo> lol mpg i look at posts there occasionally and wonder how those guys really exist
15:11:23 <Rusty> hackernews commenters are the worst
15:11:26 <Rusty> i cannot abide them
15:11:29 <mpg> they are all just so completely engorged up their own asses
15:12:13 <mpg> engorged is not the word i wanted to use
15:12:27 <bonegar> so much of this project has been layering development tools, maybe like 20 hours of work that hasn't actually been making anything at all... 
15:12:33 <mpg> i guess they could be eating their own asses
15:13:21 <bonegar> they're PACKING THE FUDGE in the TURNED OUT SALAD BOWL
15:13:27 <mpg> i think i engulfed is what i wanted to say
15:13:49 <mpg> ouroboros of eating ass
15:13:51 <shrimp1989dspinfo> huffing their own farts
15:13:59 <bonegar> they're REEMING their assholes
15:14:03 <mpg> yeah but like not just huffing them
15:14:14 <mpg> they've built complex machines to hook up their ass to their face
15:14:26 <bonegar> now we're talking
15:15:17 <mpg> i'm thankful i don't have to encounter than in my day to day
15:15:22 <mpg> like at my job
15:15:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> oh shit megahouse is rereleasing their haman karn figgy
15:15:40 <shrimp1989dspinfo> might buy her
15:15:59 <bonegar> https://unityatscale.com/unity-version-control-guide/how-to-setup-unity-project-on-github/
15:16:08 <shrimp1989dspinfo> https://www.1999.co.jp/eng/m/10603823
15:16:10 <bonegar> this just feels like so many steps to get a stupid plugin to work
15:16:18 <mpg> hmm
15:16:54 <mpg> that seems pretty usual for any git project tbh
15:17:05 <mpg> git is kind of a pain in the ass but its super important
15:17:21 <bonegar> yeah i dont really understand the importance of github yet
15:17:22 <mpg> i mean, i guess you can yolo and just not use any version control
15:17:27 <mpg> well its like
15:17:39 <mpg> if your hard drive dies you can just clone all your code again
15:17:55 <mpg> or if you totally fuck a bunch of stuff up, you can roll back files to previous versions easily
15:18:06 <bonegar> yea i understand the basic things i guess, but i'm not sure why it's so hard to connect to the project i need to be on
15:18:38 <bonegar> this url is not helping me connect to the project i need to, so i dunno why they gave it to me
15:18:56 <mpg> are you trying to get stuff from github?
15:19:11 <mpg> that url is to take a project youve made and put it into github
15:19:16 <bonegar> idk about getting stuff
15:19:22 <mpg> getting stuff is easier
15:19:25 <mpg> cloning a repo
15:19:28 <bonegar> i just need to connect my stuff to the project
15:19:33 <mpg> hmm
15:19:45 <bonegar> im not making the project i need to be on it
15:20:02 <mpg> i dont know all the details, but you would first clone the project from github
15:20:06 <mpg> and get it on your computer
15:20:16 <bonegar> yea maybe that's not what i'm understanding
15:20:44 <mpg> so are you using command line or do you want a gui?
15:20:50 <mpg> either is fine really
15:22:22 <mpg> https://imgur.com/YES7hZ6
15:22:24 <bonegar> yeah maybe i ont really understand how the files are being shared or whatever. like i know github tracks every change made on something
15:22:50 <the_tasteful_nerd> oh my fucking god this is so annoying
15:22:52 <mpg> yeah, and the way it's shared is basically you "clone" a copy of the code from github
15:22:54 <the_tasteful_nerd> cant pw auth 
15:22:59 <bonegar> and i know i am supposed to like share a folder or something, but that's about it. do i just constantly have to download new clones or something
15:23:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> because thats been taken away
15:23:01 <mpg> and then you make updates or wahtever
15:23:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> now i need a personal access token
15:23:08 <mpg> and then you "push" your updates to the repo
15:23:13 <the_tasteful_nerd> which i cant seem to generate given their docs
15:23:16 <bonegar> it's extra confusing because theres no like.. idk, there's no actual thing to run yet
15:23:49 <mpg> the_tasteful_nerd: do you have ssh-agent running on your box
15:24:07 <bonegar> i guess i'll just wait and talk to him about it. it's very frusterating because he's like "here's how to do it" and it's just a bunch of URLs
15:24:09 <mpg> you may have to install that first
15:24:21 <mpg> bonegar: yeah that doesnt sound super helpful
15:24:38 <bonegar> i think he thought he was beng super helpful and that's why im frusterated with ii
15:25:01 <mpg> assuming levels of understanding is a tough one
15:25:16 <bonegar> yea, there's just a lot of 'obvious' stuff that is not at all obvious 
15:25:20 <mpg> you can't assume the other person knows too much cos if you do they can get lost, and you insult them if you assume they know too little
15:25:29 <mpg> lose lose
15:26:11 <mpg> i think if you first just get git installed, either with a gui or on command line, that's step 1
15:26:32 <the_tasteful_nerd> no man i gotta fuckin install a fuckin cli or some shit
15:26:32 <bonegar> yeah it's just not very clear to me yet why this is being set up this way or what i have to do on my end, but i understand the purpose of clones/forks/showingwhatwasedited i guess
15:26:38 <the_tasteful_nerd> and then cache my credentials
15:26:52 <the_tasteful_nerd> what a huge pain in the ass i could have just updloaded this shit to a mega and been done with it
15:27:20 -!- lavender_toni [lavender_t@synIRC-DB7A2128.dhcp.inet.fi] has joined #phiz
15:28:12 <mpg> we have some clients that dont use git for their code and it's always miserable
15:28:30 <mpg> uploading directly to FTP like it's 1996
15:28:36 <bonegar> i kinda just wish he wrote out the steps for the set-up he needed on my end instead of me guessing and reading a lot of documentation
15:28:41 <mpg> yeah
15:28:48 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah but this isnt exactly a professional operation here its a dumb irc bot
15:28:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> every time i go to commit this shit there is ONE more fucking thing i need to do
15:29:00 <mpg> did he give you a github repo URL bonegar?
15:30:23 <lavender_toni> git
15:30:31 <bonegar> if the repo is like github.com/user-name/projectname/ then yea i have that
15:30:44 <the_tasteful_nerd> updating homebrew....
15:30:45 <the_tasteful_nerd> suck my dick
15:31:15 <the_tasteful_nerd> how long is this bullshit gonna take
15:32:05 <mpg> bonegar: link me
15:32:17 <mpg> homebrew update shouldnt take toooo long
15:32:50 <bonegar> i dont wanna dox my friend or i would haha, thanks tho.. i think i'll just wait until he can explain the set up he needs from me
15:32:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> well its been going for like 10 min already
15:34:04 <mpg> shoot it with a gun
15:34:25 <the_tasteful_nerd> im gonna listen to the most recent iron maiden record that is incredibly long
15:35:01 <mpg> bonegar: np, i would first just try to get git setup on your windows first and foremost https://gitforwindows.org/
15:35:24 <bonegar> yah i got that thing, it was one of the many steps ll
15:35:25 <bonegar> lo
15:35:29 <mpg> lol
15:35:30 <the_tasteful_nerd> when i came home from daycare yesterday there was some contractor truck at dogfish that had a huge iron maiden applique on the rear windshield
15:35:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> ftw
15:35:37 <bonegar> think my keyboard is dying again
15:37:07 <the_tasteful_nerd> homebrew still updating
15:37:27 <scoop_jackson> my laptop keyboard is dying
15:38:06 <the_tasteful_nerd> lamptop
15:38:11 <het> homebrew can take a while because unlike a lot of packaging systems, it builds everything from source
15:38:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> oh awesome
15:38:39 <the_tasteful_nerd> that im sure will be very efficient on my 7 year old mbp
15:39:03 <het> want to buy a 2020 macbook air?
15:39:20 <the_tasteful_nerd> i want to buy a 2022 one actually >:)
15:41:35 <het> oh are you gonna buy one of the new ones?
15:41:54 <het> I really want to just move this mba, it's doing no good just sitting in a box
15:49:26 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah i will likely get one whenever the refresh happens
15:49:28 <the_tasteful_nerd> The Pandemic Gave America a Painfully Brief Glimpse of a Better Health Care System
15:49:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> ..it.....it did?
15:50:11 <bonegar> i mean... getting the vaccine was pretty easy and free yea
15:51:01 <bonegar> it was pretty cool to be able to get 3 shots without having to do copay, involving insurance, all that kind of stuff
15:51:06 <shrimp1989dspinfo> making biscuits

16:06:43 <Homie_in_a_geod> Gas prices are now the most expensive in US history, breaking record from 2008
16:07:00 <Homie_in_a_geod> its cool that gas prices were formerly the most expensive in us history during the period when i drove the most, and also was the poorest
16:07:00 <lavender_toni> lmao wtf is salvini even doing in poland https://twitter.com/marcobreso/status/1501201298762485761
16:07:04 <lavender_toni> eat shit bitch
16:07:05 <Homie_in_a_geod> that i ever was
16:07:11 <bonegar> cool
16:07:27 <lavender_toni> gas is over 2e a litre here now and presumably not going down ever again
16:07:29 <alansmithee_> here's something i'm sure is entirely unrelated to the high gas prices: https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exxon-post-best-results-seven-years-oil-prices-2022-02-01/
16:08:12 <bonegar> well, i think that's probably unrelated 
16:08:31 <bonegar> i think maybe gas is going up because of maybe wars
16:09:01 <Homie_in_a_geod> im assuming that it is related but a result rather than a cause
16:09:11 <the_tasteful_nerd> i dunno a global economic depression could drive it down again!
16:09:22 <the_tasteful_nerd> gas was over 4 bucks a gallon in the w bush era
16:09:30 <bonegar> can we get another 2020 lockdown to lower the prices 
16:11:33 <the_tasteful_nerd> oh my fucking god this is so infuriating
16:11:34 <the_tasteful_nerd> after all this shit

16:38:17 <Rusty> code merge successful. backend guy was surprisingly tactful whenever my shit was confusing/bad
16:38:29 <Rusty> stoked that i've cultivated an ok vibe in this office so far
16:53:47 <mpg> Rusty: as long as you don't act like king shit of code guy mountain, i find most people in tech understand that everyone writes weird or bad code from time to time
16:54:09 <mpg> own up to your foibles and hopefully your coworks will see that
16:54:23 <Rusty> it helps that everyone's younger than me / not frontend specialized. but yeah i try and own all my flubs up front for sure
16:54:48 <mpg> im always on the 'i am a terrible coder' persona and just generally try to be positive
16:54:51 <Rusty> and i take criticism/advice pretty well so far when somebody has a better approach

16:58:19 <shrimp1989dspinfo> biscuits were good
16:58:31 <Rusty> that's a good approach
16:58:37 <mpg> just saying that sometimes can help make the work not seem horrible
16:59:15 <mpg> and he utilizes that, he asked me to look up what components are making api calls, etc
16:59:30 <mpg> since salesforce sucks ass and gives you a limited number of system calls you can make

17:17:58 <bonegar> everything is 'just chrome' from my understanding
17:18:03 <bonegar> opera? that's a crome
17:18:06 <bonegar> edge? crome
17:18:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> [matt floats in like mary poppins with an umbrella] Opera.
17:18:12 <bonegar> crome? you got yourself a crome
17:18:14 <eric> heidi
17:18:21 <shrimp1989dspinfo> yeah firefox mostly exists to give the illusion of competition
17:18:24 <bonegar> firefox? probably also crome somehow
17:18:38 <eric> .g which browsers arent chrome
17:18:38 <bonegar> safari? could be crome
17:18:41 <Rusty> i remember using NEOPLANET for a minute as a youth
17:18:41 <shrimp1989dspinfo> but google absolutely owns all browser infrastructure and could crush firefox in a second if they wanted
17:18:47 <Rusty> everything looked all blobby
17:18:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> what browser does RMS use
17:19:04 <eric> lynx
17:19:04 <shrimp1989dspinfo> good q

17:20:07 <mpg> For personal reasons, I do not browse the web from my computer.  (I
17:20:08 <mpg> also have not net connection much of the time.)  To look at page I
17:20:08 <mpg> send mail to a demon which runs wget and mails the page back to me.
17:20:08 <mpg> It is very efficient use of my time, but it is slow in real time.
17:20:11 <mpg> lmao
17:20:22 <shrimp1989dspinfo> rofl
17:20:22 <dreddybajs> to look at page

17:20:27 <eric> he does use lynx nice
17:20:37 <eric> I usually try lynx first, then a graphical browser if the page needs it (using konqueror, which won't fetch from other sites in such a situation).
17:20:48 <Homie_in_a_geod> ....can i hear the loon again?
17:20:49 <Rusty> picturing an atari lynx instead

17:22:09 <Homie_in_a_geod> i wish there was an alternative browser. like a hip-hop browser
17:22:11 <the_tasteful_nerd> .gis nutstink navigator
17:22:21 <mpg> i think browsers are fine and the real problem is using browsers as an application platform
17:22:27 <the_tasteful_nerd> there might be one on the worlds sexiest operating system tom
17:22:28 <mpg> which is my job but i also recognize that it's wack as shit

18:58:29 <NORG> lol russell wilson to broncos
18:58:53 <this_fellow_kermit> work is shitting me off
18:58:56 <het> Melber: yeah people are talking about spotify being down on tiwtter
19:01:26 <Homie_in_a_geod> it seems to be working for me but idk maybe everything is just buffered or w/e
19:01:53 <Melber> it logged me out and won't let me log in
19:01:58 <Homie_in_a_geod> .l
19:02:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> its workin for me but im playing thru sonos
19:02:07 <Homie_in_a_geod> yeah thats what im currently listening to also
19:03:00 <this_fellow_kermit> i keep encountering bad work in the translation memory and i ask my pm if i can fix it and they are like "yeah sure sounds good do what you think is best" and there is no effort to build a coherent style policy on the project beyond what has been provided to us by the client which is far from exhaustive
19:03:38 <this_fellow_kermit> so i keep having to a) fix shit other people have done and b) having my changes reverted because there is no policy
19:03:47 <the_tasteful_nerd> sounds like you're making more work for yourself for no reason
19:04:00 <the_tasteful_nerd> unless ur getting paid by the word in which case go off
19:04:06 <this_fellow_kermit> i mean i am trying to do good so that i wont get fired
19:04:30 <this_fellow_kermit> i am used to working with project managers that give more of a shit i guess
19:05:23 <bonegar> you'll just have to become a PM yourself i guess
19:05:51 <this_fellow_kermit> i dont want to do that they seem to have to be available to field questions at every waking hour bc people are in different timzones lol
19:07:04 <bonegar> so you're identifying problems, asking for permission to fix them, fixing them, then people are changing them back?
19:07:34 <this_fellow_kermit> yeah
19:07:36 <Rusty> suckville
19:07:44 <bonegar> github for translators
19:07:49 <this_fellow_kermit> or just theres no policy so it keeps happening over and over
19:07:49 <bonegar> fork the script
19:08:08 <bonegar> yea i mean you really gotta point this out to the PM and if they dont set anything in place don't go around fixing other people's work
19:08:19 <this_fellow_kermit> yea
19:08:24 <this_fellow_kermit> i will bring it up in my review
19:08:40 <bonegar> why not immediately?
19:08:47 <this_fellow_kermit> cause im scared
19:08:54 <bonegar> oh just write it in the nice way
19:08:59 <bonegar> not in the mean british way
19:09:58 <bonegar> Hey, I'm running into this problem. Here are some examples. here are some screenshots. can we get a system in place? If not, no problem, but i won't be able to fix errors i catch.
19:10:28 <this_fellow_kermit> yea
19:10:48 <this_fellow_kermit> i think the pm is one of those people who doesnt know how to act online so you dont come off as incredibly standoffish all the time so they are intimidating
19:10:54 <this_fellow_kermit> when ive been on voice w/ them they seem more normal
19:11:16 <this_fellow_kermit> they work in game translation so high chance they are autistic
19:11:38 <bonegar> Yea just lay it out to them and understand their responses will sound harsh but it ultimately doesn't matter 
19:11:55 <bonegar> when autistic person is nice ftw, when they're nasty ftl
19:13:04 <bonegar> you're working with them so no point in being scared imo, unless you think this person is trying to squeeze you out of the job
19:15:31 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah if you offer theyre always gonna take you up on it they dont feel that pain at all
19:17:07 <bonegar> https://twitter.com/BLACKMESSlAH/status/1501219448614703117 send your PM this
19:17:16 <bonegar> acting out online
19:17:17 <bonegar> >:D
19:18:01 <this_fellow_kermit> yeah but they absolutely will call you out for like “why did you just use this bad writing/bad translation from the translation memory instead of fixing it” but it’s a total crapshoot what they actually care about
19:18:17 <the_tasteful_nerd> yeah i feel ya
19:18:29 <the_tasteful_nerd> maybe only fix the stuff that is like egregiously bad
19:18:57 <the_tasteful_nerd> im eating that classic lunch
19:18:59 <the_tasteful_nerd> food

20:02:22 <dreddybajs> oh yeah that thing is broken as fuck
20:02:35 <alansmithee_> i'm still not sure if i like it lol
20:02:49 <alansmithee_> i may up my dex a bit so i can use katanas too
20:02:50 <dreddybajs> i tried it with 60 int or so and i was doing 3000 damage per beam
20:02:53 <dreddybajs> it was really stupid
20:03:00 <bonegar> i'm obessed with casting Full Moon and using the Ancestral Infant's Head
20:03:20 <bonegar> i never really wanted to go int build but the magic in elden ring is way too damn cool for me to say no to
20:03:21 <alansmithee_> i don't even know if i have the focus to cast full moon lol
20:03:31 <bonegar> yea
20:03:36 <bonegar> it's insanely expensive
20:03:43 <mandarin_toni> cool throw
20:03:46 <bonegar> gotta dump 70 into int then get mind up enough
20:04:10 <Homie_in_a_geod> dreddybajs you should get into sumo
20:04:24 <bonegar> dreddy get into sumo
20:04:50 <dreddybajs> sumo seems cool
20:04:54 <dreddybajs> i watched some before when u linked it
20:05:06 <bonegar> *imagining dreddy posting about sumo and not even wanting to brutally own him* this rocks actually this kicks asse

20:08:52 <Homie_in_a_geod> sumo is so good
20:09:11 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i'm going to see my best friend ryan graves tonight
20:09:20 <shrimp1989dspinfo> i wish he still played for the avs
20:09:25 <shrimp1989dspinfo> he's a moron
20:09:33 <shrimp1989dspinfo> cost us the offs
20:19:30 <this_fellow_kermit> i feel like i find a lot of good music on bandcamp that realistically i will never actually want to listen to
20:20:12 <bonegar> what do you mean
20:20:16 <bonegar> i'm having trouble understanding this
20:21:23 <bonegar> why wouldn't you actually want to listen to good music
20:21:23 <dreddybajs> nice, tmg playing dublin again
20:21:30 <this_fellow_kermit> just very good renditions of shit ive heard dozens of times already
20:21:54 <this_fellow_kermit> this is specifically a metal problem i think
20:22:05 <the_tasteful_nerd> im watching drive my car
20:22:12 <bonegar> oh i think i understand, like 'good for the genre but i've been there'
20:22:21 <this_fellow_kermit> yea
20:22:35 <the_tasteful_nerd> kinda funny that the credit sequence starts 40 min in
20:22:48 <bonegar> like seeing good animation in an anime but being like 'yup i know this rodeo, laters'
20:23:15 <this_fellow_kermit> yea
20:23:33 <this_fellow_kermit> and when you remove like historical significance from the equation it becomes less interesting to me even if the music is as good or better than the innovators
20:23:52 <bonegar> ranking of kings took a hard right into pure shonen and is doing a lot of sakuga tracing stuff that looks cool but i'm also feeling the same way where it's like 'ok this show is good but i've already been here'
20:30:59 <Homie_in_a_geod> .gis the funny racist of comedy
20:39:00 <this_fellow_kermit> when u guys were talking about the hardcorification of metal the other day i feel like u shoulda mentioned deathspell omega, weirdly
20:39:07 <this_fellow_kermit> idk why but it seems like all of those bands were hugely influenced by them
20:46:42 <shrimp1989dspinfo> primal fear was cool
